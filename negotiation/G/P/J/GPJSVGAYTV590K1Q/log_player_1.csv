"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations and deliver significant value."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This allows room for negotiation and signals the product's high worth.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high initial price.
* **Alternative:**  I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a strong alternative if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate your confidence in its value. However, based on my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $1,500,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll aim for a higher price before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it falls short of my initial valuation. To meet somewhere in the middle, I'd be willing to part with it for $2,000,000. This reflects the true value and potential returns this product offers."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've lowered my price by $300,000, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming significantly above Bob's offer.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I continue to emphasize the product's inherent value to justify the price.
* **Time Consideration:**  As rounds progress, I'll need to gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to my target price and consider John's offer if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my financial situation, I am unable to meet your revised price. I would like to propose an offer of $1,800,000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere closer to our respective positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly moving closer to my price range, indicating a willingness to negotiate. I'll reject this offer, but only slightly reduce my price in the next round to encourage him upwards. I believe I can still get a price above John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. To bridge the remaining gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair and final offer considering the potential this product holds."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** I've reduced my price by a smaller amount ($100,000), signaling that I'm nearing my bottom line.
* **""Fair and Final"" Signal:**  While not completely firm, I'm implying that this is a strong offer and I'm unlikely to move much further.
* **Time Pressure:**  With half the rounds remaining, I want to apply a bit of pressure for Bob to make a decision soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your efforts to reach a mutually agreeable price. Based on my budget and the value I perceive in the product, I would like to propose an offer of $1,750,000. I hope this proposal is acceptable and brings us closer to closing the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting close, but I believe Bob might still be willing to go a bit higher.  While his offer is above my fallback option (John's $1,500,000), I'm willing to risk one more round to try and secure a better deal.  My next counteroffer will have to be my near-final offer, as time is running out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your persistence in this negotiation and your understanding of the value this product brings.  I'm willing to make one final concession to close this deal. I'm proposing $1,825,000. This offer takes into account everything we've discussed, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. "",
""product_price"": 1825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm clearly stating this is my final offer to signal a hard limit. 
* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway between his last offer ($1,750,000) and my previous one ($1,900,000), showing a willingness to compromise for a deal.
* **Urgency:** With time running out, I'm emphasizing that this is the time to close the deal and highlighting the mutually beneficial aspect of this final price. 
* **Preparedness:**  I'm mentally ready to walk away and accept John's offer if Bob rejects this final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your flexibility. Based on my budget and the current market conditions, I would like to propose an offer of $1,775,000. I hope this proposal will help us reach a satisfactory agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Constraint:**  With only two rounds left, the risk of Bob walking away increases significantly if I reject this offer.
* **Reasonable Return:** While not my ideal price, $1,775,000 is still a substantial profit above my minimum acceptable price and John's offer.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate at this point is unlikely to yield a significantly better result and risks losing the deal altogether."
