"Alice,  $15,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $11,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $13,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $12,500. This is the absolute highest I can go. Let me know if you're willing to consider this.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $13,750. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,5,
