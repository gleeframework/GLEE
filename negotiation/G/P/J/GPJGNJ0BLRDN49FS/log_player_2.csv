```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $13,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $12,000.  You can try to negotiate further and see if you can get a better deal.  There are still rounds left, and you might be able to get closer to your target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $12,500. This is the absolute highest I can go. Let me know if you're willing to consider this."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $13,750. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,750 is still above your maximum budget of $12,000. While you could continue negotiating, there are only a few rounds left, and you're not guaranteed to reach an agreement. It's a safer bet to buy the product from John at your maximum price, ensuring you get the product and avoid further negotiation risks."
