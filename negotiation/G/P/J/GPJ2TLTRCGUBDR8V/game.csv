"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in your product but I can only offer $500000 at this time.  Let me know if this is something we can work with.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $500000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to negotiate.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1250000. This still leaves room for profit for both of us. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1250000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $750000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is still a considerable investment for you, but it also reflects the value of the product.  What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to compromise.  $1000000 is still above my limit.  I'm willing to offer $800000, which is my absolute maximum.  This price is fair considering the value of the product to me and allows for both of us to benefit from the deal.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I appreciate you coming up to $800000. However, I still need to ensure I can get a fair return on this product. To compromise, I'm willing to accept $900000. This is a significant investment for you, but it's also a reasonable price given the value of the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,7,
