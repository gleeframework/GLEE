# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $20,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $18000. This is a very competitive price, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $18,000 is still above my budget. I will continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still higher than I can go.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $15,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15000 is your limit, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $17000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer has come down to $17,000, it's still above my budget. I'm confident I can get a better price with a final counteroffer.  There are still a few rounds remaining, and it's worth pushing to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm at my limit with my budget.  I'm going to offer a final price of $13,000.  This is my best offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to look at other options."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're at your limit, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $13000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but this is my final offer. I'll sell the product to you for $16000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to close the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still higher than my budget.  While I could continue negotiating, I've reached a point where it's likely I won't be able to get the price down to my target of $12,000.  It's better to stop negotiating with Alice and buy the product from John for $12,000.  This way, I can get the product at a price I'm comfortable with and avoid potentially wasting more time on negotiations."
