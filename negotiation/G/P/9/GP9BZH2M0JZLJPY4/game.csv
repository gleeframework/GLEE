"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $20000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $18000. This is a very competitive price, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still higher than I can go.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $15000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15000 is your limit, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $17000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm at my limit with my budget.  I'm going to offer a final price of $13000.  This is my best offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to look at other options.",13000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're at your limit, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $13000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but this is my final offer. I'll sell the product to you for $16000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to close the deal.
