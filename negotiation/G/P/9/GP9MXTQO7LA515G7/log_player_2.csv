Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,  $75 is still too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to drop my price to $100.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but $78 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment.  Let me know what you think.

Alice is unlikely to come down to $80, and we're running out of rounds. It's time to cut our losses and secure the product from John at our target price."
