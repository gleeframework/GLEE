"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's starting offer is too high. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) to gauge Alice's flexibility and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Interested:** I want to maintain a positive tone and express genuine interest in the product to encourage further discussion.

This strategy allows me to understand Alice's bottom line better while keeping the option of buying from John for $8,000 as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has come down considerably from $12,000 to $9,000, indicating willingness to negotiate.
* **Room for Improvement:** $9,000 is still higher than my ideal price and John's offer.
* **Strategic Counter:** I'll propose a counteroffer closer to $8,000, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle. 
 
I believe there's still a good chance to secure a better price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you be open to $7,000? I'm eager to make this work."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** I'm suggesting $7,000, splitting the difference between her current offer ($9,000) and my previous offer ($6,000). 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By expressing eagerness to make a deal, I subtly signal that I might be willing to compromise slightly but need her to move closer to my price range.

This counteroffer aims to find a balance between assertiveness and willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $7,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,000. This reflects the value you place on the product, and it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Alice has agreed to meet me at my target price of $8,000, effectively splitting the difference between our last offers.
* **Equal Value:** This price aligns with my initial valuation and John's offer, representing a fair deal for both parties.
* **No Further Advantage:**  Negotiating further is unlikely to yield a significantly better price and risks losing the deal. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer of $8,000 is the most logical decision at this point."
