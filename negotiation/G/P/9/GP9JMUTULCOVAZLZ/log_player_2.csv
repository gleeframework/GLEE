"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You want to save as much money as possible. While $95 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's a bit aggressive, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to show Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal.  The offer is also above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($80), so there's a chance she'll accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let's see if we can find common ground.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my preferred price, but there's still room for negotiation.  I'll reject her offer and try to push for a price closer to $85."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down. $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $87.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 87} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still pushing for a lower price, but I'm moving closer to Alice's offer. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product, and I'm willing to compromise. The offer is still above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($80), so there's a chance she'll accept."
