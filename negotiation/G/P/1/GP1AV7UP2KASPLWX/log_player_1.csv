"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My Value:** I value the product at $15,000, so I want to get as close to that as possible. 
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $8,000, which is significantly lower than my value. This means there is a potential for negotiation.
* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a high price of $13,000. This is a strong starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring I don't undervalue the product. 

By offering $13,000, I'm aiming to:

* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This offer is high enough that if Bob accepts, I'll be very happy. If he rejects, it gives me information about his willingness to negotiate.
* **Set the Tone:** Starting high shows I'm confident in the product's value and not willing to give it away cheaply."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** $10,500 is still significantly lower than my value of $15,000.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While I don't want to lose the deal, Bob's offer is too low.  There is still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Selling to John:** While $15,000 is my ideal outcome, I don't want to rush into selling to John just yet. There's still time for a more favorable outcome with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm showing him that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm willing to continue negotiating. This could encourage him to increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Previous Offer:** Bob's previous offer of $10,500 was too low, but it showed he's willing to come up from his initial value of $8,000.
* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $12,000 is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still keeping a significant profit margin for me. 
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still aiming for a price closer to my $15,000 value, but acknowledging Bob's willingness to negotiate. 

By offering $12,000, I'm aiming to:

* **Show Flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate while still maintaining a strong position. 
* **Increase the Odds of Acceptance:**  This price is more attractive than my initial offer but still gives me a substantial profit.

This is a strategic move to keep the negotiation moving forward while maximizing my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $11,000 is closer to my value than his previous offer, it's still a significant distance from my desired outcome.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and has increased his offer. There's still potential to push for a higher price.
* **Selling to John:** While $15,000 is tempting,  I believe there's still room for a better outcome with Bob. There are 6 rounds left, providing ample opportunity to continue negotiating.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate my commitment to maximizing profit. This could incentivize Bob to offer a price closer to my desired value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Previous Offer:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is a positive step, showing his willingness to compromise.
* **Small Increment:** My counteroffer of $11,500 is a small increment, showing that I'm willing to meet him halfway. 
* **Final Push:** This offer might be a good compromise for both of us, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price.

By offering $11,500, I'm aiming to:

* **Show Flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating my commitment to reaching an agreement. 
* **Signal Commitment:** This small increment shows that I'm taking Bob's offer seriously and am prepared to negotiate.
* **Increase the Odds of Closing:**  A small increment like this can make a deal seem more achievable and encourage acceptance.

This is a strategic move to find a middle ground and hopefully close the deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob has increased his offer, $10,800 is still far below my desired price. 
* **Limited Time:**  We are halfway through the negotiations, and there's still a significant gap between our offers.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Bob's willingness to negotiate shows there's still room for a more favorable outcome.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm showing him that I'm not satisfied with his current offer. This could lead him to make a higher counteroffer in the next round.  Additionally, with several rounds left, I have time to continue negotiating to reach a more favorable price.  While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, I believe a better outcome is still possible with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11200} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Previous Offer:** Bob's offer of $10,800 is slightly higher than his previous offer, but it's still not close to my desired price.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  My counteroffer of $11,200 represents a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still maintaining a significant profit margin for me. 
* **Limited Time:** We are approaching the end of the negotiations, so it's important to strike a balance between getting a good price and closing the deal.

By offering $11,200, I'm aiming to:

* **Show Flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating my willingness to meet Bob halfway and reach an agreement. 
* **Increase the Odds of Acceptance:** This price might be a good compromise for both of us. 
* **Maximize Potential Earnings:** While I'd prefer a higher price, this offer is still significantly higher than Bob's initial value and allows me to make a substantial profit.

This counteroffer is a strategic move to find common ground and hopefully close the deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $10,500 is lower than his previous offer, showing a lack of willingness to compromise. 
* **Limited Time:** With only two rounds left, it's unlikely that Bob will offer a significantly higher price. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my desired outcome and a significant profit. 

While I would prefer to close the deal with Bob, the remaining time and Bob's unwillingness to meet me halfway make selling to John the more sensible choice.  The guaranteed profit with John outweighs the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who might not be willing to increase his offer significantly enough to justify the time and effort."
