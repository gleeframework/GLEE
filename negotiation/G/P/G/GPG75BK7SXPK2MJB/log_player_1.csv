Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum. This means a deal is impossible unless Bob values the product more than $1,500,000 for some reason.

**The Offer**

Since a deal with Bob seems unlikely, you have two options:

**Option 1: Aim High and Stick to John**

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available elsewhere. Given its unique value, I'm asking for $1,600,000."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

* **Rationale:**  Bob is unlikely to accept, but it leaves no room for negotiation and you can move on to John.

**Option 2:  A More ""Realistic"" Approach (Knowing it's Still Unlikely)**

{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product could be highly beneficial for you. I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer before I explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

* **Rationale:**  While still above Bob's valuation, this approach might make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal than he is. It's improbable he'll accept, but it opens a conversation where you can reiterate the product's value.

**Important Note:**  Without additional information about Bob's motivations or potential to increase his perceived value of the product, it's highly likely you'll end up selling to John."
