"Thank you for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you reaching out. I'm looking to get a great deal, and $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to do $90?  That's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $110 is still a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  I think that would be a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not sure I can go as low as $100, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. How about we try $115?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price for your product, but $115 is still a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us and allows us to come to an agreement.",105.0,Bob,6,
