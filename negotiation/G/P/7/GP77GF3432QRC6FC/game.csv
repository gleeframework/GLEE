"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,100,000?  This would still be a significant benefit for you and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
