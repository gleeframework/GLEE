Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible without losing the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly higher than her minimum ($12,000). 
* **Confident but Fair:** The message aims to convey that the product is fairly priced while acknowledging its value to Bob. This approach can encourage Bob to accept the offer without feeling pressured."
