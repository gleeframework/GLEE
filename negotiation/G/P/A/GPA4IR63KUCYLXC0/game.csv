"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you're confident in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to buy it for $80. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $80 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $90. If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $100. It's getting close to my minimum price, but I think it's still a fair deal. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $95. This is my final offer. If it works for you, let's finalize the deal.",95.0,Bob,6,
