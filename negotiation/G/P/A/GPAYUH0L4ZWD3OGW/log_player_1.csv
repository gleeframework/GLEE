Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $100 (John), you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $150 leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle for a price higher than $100. 
* **Loss Aversion:**  People are often more motivated by avoiding a loss than by making a gain. By offering a higher price initially, you frame the negotiation around Bob potentially ""losing out"" on a good deal if he doesn't negotiate down. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know the product's worth to Bob, you don't know his financial situation or how much he's willing to spend.  
* **Relationship:** If you value a future relationship with Bob, being too aggressive with your initial offer might not be the best approach."
