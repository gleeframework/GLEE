Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my [product description] for a price of $1,000,000. This product is worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe it will be a valuable asset for your [reason for value to Bob]. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** This message emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, highlighting the product's worth to both parties. It also avoids explicitly mentioning the potential sale to John, keeping the focus on Bob. 
* **Product Price:**  Offering the product for $1,000,000 is the optimal strategy. It maximizes my potential earnings while ensuring I won't lose out if Bob rejects the offer. Since John is willing to pay $1,000,000, there's no incentive to lower the price for Bob. 

By offering the product at its full value to Bob, I create a win-win scenario. If Bob accepts, I maximize my profit. If he rejects, I can still sell to John without any loss."
