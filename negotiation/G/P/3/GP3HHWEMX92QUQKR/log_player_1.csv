"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept this first offer. This allows me to gauge his interest and potential budget without risking a quick sale to John.  I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to give in right away. Bob's counter-offer shows he's interested, but I believe I can get a higher price. I want to see if I can push him a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a price that's closer to his initial counter-offer but still higher than my minimum.  This shows flexibility but also that I'm not willing to just accept his initial price.  I'm hoping this will start a more balanced negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, and we're already halfway through the rounds.  While I'd ideally like more, it's not worth risking a lower offer or waiting longer, especially since I have a guaranteed sale to John.  I'll take the $16,500 and secure the sale."
