"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You are only willing to pay $80, and her offer is $110. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay a maximum of $80 for the product. This counteroffer is your absolute bottom line."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're still aiming for a price closer to $80, but you're willing to budge a bit. A counteroffer of $85 shows you're serious about buying the product but also signals you're not willing to go much higher.  This is a good compromise point, as it's a reasonable middle ground between your previous offer and Alice's current price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's price is still above your comfort zone.  You've already gone back and forth a few times, and it's clear there isn't much more wiggle room with Alice.  John is offering a guaranteed price of $80, which is your target.  It's time to cut your losses and move on to the guaranteed deal."
