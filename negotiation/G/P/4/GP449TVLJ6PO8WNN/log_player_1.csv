Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it. This price is still a fair value for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit and me to secure a valuable product within my budget.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
