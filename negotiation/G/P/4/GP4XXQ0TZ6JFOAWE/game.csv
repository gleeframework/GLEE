"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $9,000 is a good offer, I'm looking for a bit more to make this work.  How about $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's meet in the middle!",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is a good step forward, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  This would be a fair price given the value of the product and our respective budgets. ",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $9,750. That's a good compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think.",9750.0,Bob,6,
