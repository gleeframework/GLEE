,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's still a great price for this amazing product!",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $130? That way we both get a good deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your proposal, but I'm not willing to split the difference at $130. I'm still willing to compromise, though. How about we meet at $132? It's a small step back from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price for this great product.",132.0,Alice,5,
