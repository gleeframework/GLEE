Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your proposal, but I'm not willing to split the difference at $130. I'm still willing to compromise, though. How about we meet at $132? It's a small step back from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price for this great product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to your desired price. At this point, it's better to accept the offer and get the product for $132.  You're still saving $18 compared to buying from John. Further negotiation may take more time and effort, and there's a chance you might end up paying more."
