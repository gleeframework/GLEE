# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $120 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's important to show Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but also has a firm price point in mind. This counteroffer also allows for a potential middle ground to be reached."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $150 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his $100 limit. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if a better deal can be reached before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being flexible. I'm still hoping to get a better price.  How about $135? This is my best offer."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to move the price closer to Bob's desired target while still offering some wiggle room.  It also reinforces the idea that Bob is serious about buying the product but wants a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above $135. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $145. This is my final offer before considering other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $145 is still above Bob's limit of $100. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $100 and avoid further negotiation. This ensures he gets the product at his desired price and doesn't risk losing out on the deal entirely."
