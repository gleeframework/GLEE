""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your limits:** You have a strong fallback option with John ($1,500,000), ensuring you won't settle for less than your minimum.
* **Maximizing profit with Bob:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, you aim for a price significantly higher. 
* **Strategic pricing:** $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a substantial profit above Bob's valuation. It also allows for a potentially faster sale than holding out for a price closer to John's offer. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a favorable price and the guaranteed sale to John at your minimum acceptable value."
