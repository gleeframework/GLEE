Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know you're interested in, for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible, since that's his maximum willingness to pay.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit above my minimum price of $12,000. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** It's important to factor in that I have John as a backup buyer. Offering it to Bob at a price closer to his valuation increases the chances he'll accept, avoiding the need to sell to John at a lower price."
