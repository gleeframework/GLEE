**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing at a very slow rate.  He is still very far from our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  

Continuing negotiations with Bob is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer in a reasonable timeframe. It's more profitable at this point to take the guaranteed offer from John."
