"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $500,000 is too low, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we consider $1,600,000?  This reflects some flexibility on my end while acknowledging the significant value this product brings.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate the movement on the price, but we're still quite far apart.  To be frank, I have other options for purchasing a similar product.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000, but that's my limit for now.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to negotiate.  I understand you have other options, however, I believe those lack the unique advantages this product offers.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant price reduction and reflects my strong desire to find a solution that works for us both.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
