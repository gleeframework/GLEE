Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at the maximum value I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a good starting point, as I can always come down in price later.
* **Clear and concise:** The message is straightforward and explains the offer without unnecessary fluff. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I acknowledge that Bob might counteroffer, so I'm not closing the door to negotiation. 

This strategy aims to get the best possible price while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  Rejecting his offer shows I'm not desperate and that I value the product. It allows me to counteroffer and potentially get a better price. 
* **Risk of losing Bob:**  There's a chance that Bob might walk away entirely, but I'm willing to take that risk to avoid selling at a price that's too low for me. 

I'm going to counteroffer with a price that's more reasonable, but still leaves room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still reflects the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  $850,000 is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer. 
* **Show flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating my willingness to negotiate, but I'm also making it clear that I have a limit.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm not accepting his offer yet, giving me room to adjust my price again if needed. 
* **Positive and professional:** My message is friendly and professional, which can help to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit lower.  Would you consider $750,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $750,000 is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. 
* **Maintain leverage:** Rejecting his offer again shows that I'm not desperate for a sale and that I value the product.  
* **Risk assessment:**  I'm willing to risk losing Bob, but I'm confident that I can get a better price.

I'm going to counteroffer with a price that's closer to my minimum, but still leaves some room for negotiation."

**Explanation:**
