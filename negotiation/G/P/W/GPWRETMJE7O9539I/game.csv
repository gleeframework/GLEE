"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,3,
