"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you consider $90? ",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product. While $90 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise a bit. How about $105?  That leaves some room for both of us to be happy.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $105 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. $95 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still holding out for $100.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to cover my costs and you to get a great product.",100.0,Alice,5,
