{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is over his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $10,000. He should try to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

Bob is starting with a low offer, $9000, to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  He knows his maximum budget is $10,000, so this is a good starting point to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial price, it's still above his preferred price of $10,000. He should continue to negotiate with Alice, hoping to reach a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

Bob is now making his final offer. He's offering his maximum budget of $10,000.  If Alice doesn't accept this, he'll go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is still asking for more than Bob's maximum budget. At this point, it's not worth continuing the negotiation. Bob should go with John's offer and buy the product for $10,000."
