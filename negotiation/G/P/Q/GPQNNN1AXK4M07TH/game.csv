"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Can you meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $105?  I'm confident you'll be happy with the product at this price.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",95.0,Bob,4,
