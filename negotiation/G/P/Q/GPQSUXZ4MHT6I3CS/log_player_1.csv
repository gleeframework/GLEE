Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $120, there's a chance to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $119 makes it slightly more appealing than its value to Bob ($100) while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum ($120).
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The phrase ""limited time"" is a gentle nudge to encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer."
