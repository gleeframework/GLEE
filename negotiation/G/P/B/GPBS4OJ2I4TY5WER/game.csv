"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1200000, but that's my final offer.  I believe this is a fair compromise considering the potential value this product brings. Let me know if you're interested.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

I'm still not convinced that $1200000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.,900000.0,Bob,4,
