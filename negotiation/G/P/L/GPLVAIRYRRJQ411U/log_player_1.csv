{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, given its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for potential compromise and gains for both of us.  I believe $10,000 is a good starting point as it is likely to be accepted by Bob, and I'll be able to profit more than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $10000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I will reject his offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9000. This would be a good deal for both of us and a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $9,000 is within my acceptable range and better than selling to John.  It's a good compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this outcome."
