"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $10000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9250? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know if you're interested!",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9000. This would be a good deal for both of us and a good compromise. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,
