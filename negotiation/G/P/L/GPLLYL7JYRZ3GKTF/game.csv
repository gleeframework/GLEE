"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,500 is lower than I'd prefer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $11,000. This would allow us both to get a good deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $10,750? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not quite ready to accept $10,750. Let's split the difference and go with $10,875. This would be a fair compromise and I believe we can finalize the deal.",10875.0,Alice,5,
