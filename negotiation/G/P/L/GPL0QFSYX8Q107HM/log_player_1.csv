"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'll be interested in. It's priced at $90, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $90 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  I'd be happy to pay $75 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, I'm holding out for a price closer to my minimum. I can still get $80 from John, so I'm not desperate yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  $75 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $85 is still a bit higher than I'm hoping for. How about $80?  That's the absolute maximum I can pay at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $80 is my minimum, and while I could sell to John for the same price, there's no guarantee that I'll find another buyer willing to pay more in the future.  It's better to secure the sale now."
