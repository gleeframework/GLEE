"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be immensely valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm confident this product offers you even greater value.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not convinced the product is worth $1,375,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go as high as $1,250,000. This is my final offer.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but that price doesn't reflect the value this product brings. I'm willing to make one more move to close this deal quickly. Let's settle at $1,310,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair.",1310000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,250,000. I'm willing to make one more move to try to close the deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $1,275,000.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
