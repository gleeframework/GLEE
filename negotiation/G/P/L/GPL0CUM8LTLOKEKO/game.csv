"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and see your desire to secure this product at a favorable price. However, $1,050,000 doesn't quite reflect the full value it holds for your business.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, a price that still allows me to recoup a fair amount while giving you a significant advantage. I'm confident this is a win-win scenario.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
