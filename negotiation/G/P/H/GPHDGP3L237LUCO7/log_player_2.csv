"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above your target price. There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially save money by making a counteroffer.  Since you're looking to save as much money as possible, rejecting the initial offer and negotiating is the best strategy at this point."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,250,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value it brings to your business. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still not at your desired level. You're aiming for the lowest possible price, and there's still some wiggle room. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually agreeable price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,320,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,320,000, which is very close to your counteroffer of $1,300,000. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might become more firm on her price or even walk away from the deal. Considering that John is selling the same product for $1,500,000, accepting Alice's offer is the best course of action. It saves you $180,000 compared to buying from John."
