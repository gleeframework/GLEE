Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $120 to you, and while I value it highly, I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You have insider information that the product is worth $120 to Bob. This gives you leverage in negotiations.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation (Slight):** While aiming high, offering it at $100 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to feel like he's getting a deal.
* **Above Your Minimum:** The $100 price point ensures you make a significant profit over your minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Not Too Greedy:**  Asking for the full $120 Bob values it at might make him balk, even if it's a fair price in his eyes. Leaving some ""consumer surplus"" on the table can make a deal more likely.

This strategy balances maximizing your potential profit while increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
