"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $120 to you, and while I value it highly, I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling the product for $100, which is less than John's price of $120.
* **The product is worth more to you than to Alice:** You value the product at $120, and Alice values it at $80. This means you are still getting a good deal, even at $100."
