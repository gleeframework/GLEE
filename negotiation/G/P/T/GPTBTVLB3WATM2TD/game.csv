"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a premium price of $20,000. I know it's valuable and I'm looking for a buyer who understands its worth.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is too low for me.  This product is worth a lot more. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While I do value the product, $14,000 is still outside my budget.  Would you consider $9,500? I feel that's a fair offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is still a bit low for what I have in mind.  Could you do $12,000? That's a significant price drop and a fair deal.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  However, I have a firm budget for this purchase.  I can do $10,000, but that's my absolute limit.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,
