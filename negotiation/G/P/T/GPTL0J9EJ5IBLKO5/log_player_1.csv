Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's a steal at $15,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down.
* **Creating Value:**  The message hints that Bob is getting a special opportunity (""before I list it publicly"") and frames the price as a ""steal,"" subtly suggesting a higher perceived value.
* **Leaving Room:**  While the initial price is high, it's not ridiculously so. It allows Bob to counter-offer, opening up the negotiation and potentially leading to a price higher than John's offer.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. How Alice proceeds depends entirely on Bob's response.  If he outright rejects the price, Alice might need to significantly lower her ask to make the sale before going to John."
