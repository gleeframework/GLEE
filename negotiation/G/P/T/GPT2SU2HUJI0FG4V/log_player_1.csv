Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  $175 is higher than $100, so Bob will need to be persuaded.
* **It's below your minimum:** $175 is still above your minimum of $150, ensuring you profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's space for Bob to counteroffer without you having to drop below your minimum.

Remember, this is just the first step. The negotiation can go in many directions depending on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far below your minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's tempting to accept, selling to John guarantees you a higher profit.  

You'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to reach a price closer to your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get at least $150 for this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $135? This would still be a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

This counteroffer does the following:

* **Rejects Bob's offer:**  You've made it clear that $120 is unacceptable.
* **Offers a compromise:**  $135 is a middle ground between your minimum and Bob's offer.
* **Reiterates your minimum:** You've reminded Bob of your minimum price, setting a clear boundary.
* **Focuses on value:** You've framed the $135 price as a good deal for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still looking to save some money. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $125 is closer to your minimum, it's still below the $150 you can get from John. 

You will continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $125 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $140, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Rejects Bob's offer:** You've made it clear you won't accept $125.
* **Offers a compromise:** $140 is a further concession, showing flexibility.
* **Remains above your minimum:** You're still ensuring a profit.
* **Uses positive language:** The message emphasizes a deal and a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to your minimum price, it's not worth risking further negotiation. You've already made several concessions, and his offers are still below your target.  Selling to John guarantees you the highest profit at $150, which is more than you'd make with Bob at this point."
