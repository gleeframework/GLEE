"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with. However, $1,200,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a significant concession, and it's the best I can offer. If you're serious about this product, let's try to find a middle ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. Can we try $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,250,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession - how about $1,300,000? This is a fair price considering the value of this product and the concessions I've already made.  If you're serious about acquiring this, let's close this deal. ",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to make a fair deal, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer. Can we try $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Bob,6,
