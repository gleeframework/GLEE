"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. Let's start with a price of $1,300,000. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a good profit while staying within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your commitment to finding a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I was thinking that since we're so close, I could offer you a slight discount to sweeten the deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,280,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm still not able to go that high. I'm happy to increase my offer slightly to $1,225,000. This is a good price for both of us.  I think it's a fair compromise, considering the value we both place on this product.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still think the product's value is higher than $1,225,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,225,000 and my original offer of $1,300,000. Let's try $1,262,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable compromise.",1262500.0,Alice,7,
