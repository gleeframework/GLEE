Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product represents a significant opportunity for you, one that aligns perfectly with your needs and goals.  Its value to you is undeniable. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,500,000.  This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to be ambitious with Bob. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Urgency & Scarcity:**  The ""limited-time offer"" and mentioning ""other interested parties"" create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**It's important to note:** This strategy is risky.  There's a chance Bob will be turned off by the high price and walk away. However, the potential reward of a 50% profit margin makes this calculated risk worthwhile."
