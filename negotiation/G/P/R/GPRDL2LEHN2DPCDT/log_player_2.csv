"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $120. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Since Bob's maximum budget is $150, there's room to negotiate and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is within Bob's budget and a good price.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't go lower.  Accepting the offer is the best option in this scenario."
