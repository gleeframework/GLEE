Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially still landing above my minimum price. 
* **Secure the Sale:** While a higher offer like $14,500 is tempting, it increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. Accepting $14,000 ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of going to John, my backup buyer."
