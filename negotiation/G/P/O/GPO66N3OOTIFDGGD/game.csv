"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product.  I believe its value to you would be immense, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial price.  My initial offer is $1400000.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. Can you meet me at this price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To show my commitment to finding common ground, I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This offer is still significantly below my minimum expectation, but it demonstrates my willingness to compromise. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1250000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. Can you meet me at $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is still quite a bit lower than where I need to be. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is a significant concession, but it shows I'm serious about closing this deal. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1300000 is a fair price. I'm willing to pay $1150000, which is the highest price I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have your limits, but $1150000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to make one final compromise.  I'm going to lower my price to $1250000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement. This is my final offer.",1250000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you've made a significant concession, but I'm still not willing to pay $1250000. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from another seller.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
