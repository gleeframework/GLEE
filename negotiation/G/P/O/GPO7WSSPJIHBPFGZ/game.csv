"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1400000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1500000 is my absolute bottom line.  This price still offers you a great value for the product, considering what it's worth to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1500000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to propose a compromise: $1420000. I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to me and your original asking price.",1420000.0,Bob,4,
