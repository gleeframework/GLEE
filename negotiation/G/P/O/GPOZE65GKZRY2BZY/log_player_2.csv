Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle.

# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my minimum value. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1120000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of owning this product.
