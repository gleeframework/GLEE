"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a better deal than John's $1,200,000, there's room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I'm looking for, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal quickly. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob is serious about negotiating. 
* **Focus on Fair Value:**  Bob emphasizes a fair price for both parties, framing the counteroffer as a win-win.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning a quick close adds pressure to Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,300,000 is too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This would still allow me to make a good profit, while still being a reasonable price for you. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is only $50,000 above Bob's ideal price of $1,300,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will become too firm and the deal will fall apart.
* **Time Constraint:**  Bob only has 10 rounds to close the deal, and rejecting this offer risks losing the opportunity to buy from John for $1,200,000 if the negotiation drags on.

By accepting the offer, Bob secures a good price while also minimizing the risk of losing the product altogether."
