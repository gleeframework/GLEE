"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I'm looking for, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal quickly. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,300,000 is too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This would still allow me to make a good profit, while still being a reasonable price for you. Let's try to close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
