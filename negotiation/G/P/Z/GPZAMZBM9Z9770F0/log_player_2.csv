"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can do much better than $1,200,000, and you have a backup option with John."

I'm starting with a strong counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal, but still leaves room for negotiation."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay. I will continue to negotiate with Alice, as there is still room for a better price.  I'm not ready to accept the offer from John yet, as I believe I can get a lower price from Alice."

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, showing that I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a price closer to my target. This strategy keeps the negotiation moving forward while maintaining a good deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has come down in price, but it's still higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm confident I can get a better deal with one more counteroffer."

I'm making a final counteroffer at $1,000,000, which is my maximum price and John's price. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll move on to buying from John. This is my best chance to secure the product at a price that works for me."
