"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $750000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $600000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value and rarity you mentioned.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600000.

I'm willing to make a small concession and offer you a price of $670000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value and rarity.",670000.0,Alice,5,
