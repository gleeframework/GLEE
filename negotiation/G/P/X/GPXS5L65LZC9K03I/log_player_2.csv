"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The offer is way too high! It's much more than your $80 limit and even more than Alice's own valuation. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only do  $60."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counter-offer is substantially lower than Alice's asking price, but it's important to start low to leave room for negotiation.
* **Signaling Interest:**  The message conveys that you are indeed interested in the product, which might make Alice more receptive to negotiating.
* **Anchoring:**  By throwing out a low number first, you are attempting to anchor the negotiation closer to your desired price range.

This strategy aims to bring Alice down significantly in her next offer while still showing you're a serious buyer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $60 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down, $110 is still above your maximum budget of $80.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's a significant gap between your last offer ($60) and her current one ($110), suggesting there's room for further negotiation.
* **John is an Option:**  Remember, you can always buy from John for $80 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't reach a price you're comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about $70? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Strategically:** We're increasing our offer, showing Alice we're willing to negotiate, but still staying significantly below her price.
* **Targeting a Reasonable Price:** $70 is a substantial jump from $60, making it more appealing to Alice while keeping you well below your $80 limit and her $110 offer.
* **Simple and Clear:**  The message keeps the tone positive and straightforward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I can't go as low as $70.  Would you be willing to consider $95? That's a significant reduction on my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Even though Alice has come down considerably, $95 is still above your $80 budget. 
* **Close to John's Price:** At this point, the difference between Alice's offer and John's fixed price of $80 is getting smaller. It's not worth overspending much when you have a guaranteed option.
* **One Last Push:** Rejecting gives you a chance to make one final offer, closer to your budget, before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but I have a strict budget. I could go up to $75, but that's absolutely my limit. It's a fair offer considering the market value."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is your last attempt to negotiate with Alice before considering John's offer.
* **Firm but Fair:** The message is firm in stating your budget limit while acknowledging Alice's efforts and justifying the offer with the ""market value"" (hinting you know of other options).
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $75 puts you close to your limit but still leaves a small margin for Alice to potentially accept a price slightly lower than her last offer.

This offer creates a clear decision point for Alice while still aiming for the best possible deal for you."
