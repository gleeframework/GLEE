{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price, but still lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A $900,000 price allows for some room for negotiation and counteroffers without immediately going to my minimum. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value and potential of the product for Bob.

**Strategy:** 

This initial offer sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation. I'm prepared to make further counteroffers if needed, but I'll also be ready to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't meet my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $900000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below the $1,000,000 I need to get from this sale.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob. There's a chance I can get him to pay closer to my minimum.
* **Risk of losing to John:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000.  However, there's a chance I can get closer to this with Bob if I'm patient and strategic.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $880,000. This is a fair price considering the value this product will bring you. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 880000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's offer and my previous offer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Setting a clear expectation:**  I'm making it clear that I'm unlikely to go lower.

**Strategy:**

* **Finding a compromise:** I'm trying to find a price point that Bob is likely to accept while still getting closer to my desired price.
* **Preparing for rejection:** I'm ready to continue negotiating if Bob rejects my counteroffer.
* **Monitoring John's offer:** I'll be keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $880000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $860000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not enough:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a final counteroffer. 
* **Risk of losing to John:**  Selling to John guarantees me a good profit, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will make one final counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price slightly above his offer. I'm prepared to accept a slightly lower price if necessary, but I'll be ready to walk away and sell to John if Bob rejects my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I'm willing to be flexible, $860,000 is still below my minimum price point.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to go down to $870,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 870000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counteroffer:** This is my last attempt to get a price closer to my desired value while showing flexibility.
* **Slightly Higher:** I'm offering a price slightly above Bob's last offer, creating a sense of urgency and making him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Clear Closing:** I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer, signaling that further negotiation is unlikely.

**Strategy:**

* **High Stakes:** This is a high-stakes counteroffer. If Bob rejects, I'll move forward with John.
* **Balancing Act:** I'm trying to balance my desire for a higher price with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer.
* **Time Pressure:** I'm aiming to create a sense of time pressure to encourage Bob to accept my offer."
