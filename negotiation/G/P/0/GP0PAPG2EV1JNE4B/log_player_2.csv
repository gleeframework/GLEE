"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason:  $900,000 is a good price, but it's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm. While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reason: Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and $825,000 is a good deal. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and I'd end up paying more to John."
