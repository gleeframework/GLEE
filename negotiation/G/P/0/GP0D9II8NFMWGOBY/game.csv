"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,025,000.  This gives us both a good deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but we're still a bit apart.  $975,000 just doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference and call it $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
