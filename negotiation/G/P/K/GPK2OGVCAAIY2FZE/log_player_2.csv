Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already given you a good discount. I can do $11,500, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $11,500. Continuing the negotiation has a low chance of getting the price significantly closer to $10,000, and risks Alice walking away. Buying from John for $15,000, while not ideal, guarantees I get the product and avoids further haggling."
