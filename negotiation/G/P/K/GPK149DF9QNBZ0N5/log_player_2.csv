"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's worth a great deal to you given its features and your needs. I'd like to start the negotiation at $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is quite high. It leaves little room for negotiation and is close to your maximum budget. Rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product but could we bring the price down to $10,500?"", 
""product_price"": 10500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget concerns, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Could you meet me halfway at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has come down in price, it's still beneficial to negotiate further. There's room between $11,000 and your $10,500 counteroffer, and Alice seems willing to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. How about we settle at $10,750? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", 
""product_price"": 10750
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're clearly very interested in this product and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. I could be persuaded to go down to $10,900, but that's my absolute best offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling that this is her final offer. While it's slightly above your ideal price, it's a significant saving compared to John's offer. Accepting now ensures you get the product at a good price without risking the negotiation breaking down."
