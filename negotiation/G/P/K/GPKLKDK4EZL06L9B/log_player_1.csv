Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a unique chance to acquire it before I open the offer to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get even more from Bob.
* **Finding a Sweet Spot:** Offering the product between Bob's value ($1,000,000) and yours ($1,200,000) creates a potential win-win. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning ""other interested parties,"" you subtly encourage Bob to act quickly without being overly aggressive.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
