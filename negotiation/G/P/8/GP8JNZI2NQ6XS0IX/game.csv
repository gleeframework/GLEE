"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm.  $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8500?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can make this work.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
