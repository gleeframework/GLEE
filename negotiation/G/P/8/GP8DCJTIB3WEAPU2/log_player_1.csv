"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to drop to $10,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $10250? I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'll counteroffer one last time before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,250 still isn't quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $10,400 as a final compromise. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $10200? I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm getting close to my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit with Bob's negotiations. His offers are still too low for me to justify selling the product to him. Since John is willing to pay my minimum asking price, I'm going to sell the product to him."
