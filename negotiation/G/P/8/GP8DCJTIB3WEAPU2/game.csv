"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the highest I can go.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to drop to $10500. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $10250? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10250 still isn't quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $10400 as a final compromise. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal. Let me know your thoughts.",10400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $10200? I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm getting close to my limit.",10200.0,Bob,6,
