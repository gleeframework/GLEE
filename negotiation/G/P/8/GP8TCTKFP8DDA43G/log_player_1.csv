Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your minimum ($12,000) at $11,500 creates a sense of urgency and a perceived deal for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $11,500, there might be a small window for negotiation if Bob counters. However, you should be prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't meet a price you find acceptable."
