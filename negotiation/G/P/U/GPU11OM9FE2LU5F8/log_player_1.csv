Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $140."",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob values the product at $150. Aiming for a price close to this value maximizes potential profit.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting with $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $100 provides a safety net.  This allows for a bolder initial offer to Bob."
