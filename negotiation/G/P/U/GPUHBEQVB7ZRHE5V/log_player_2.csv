Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a very competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I think this price is a fair compromise.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get the price down, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. I hope this is a price you're comfortable with.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and while I could try for a slightly better price, $825,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $1,500,000."
