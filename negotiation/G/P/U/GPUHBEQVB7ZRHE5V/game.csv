"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider a lower price?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a very competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I think this price is a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your desire to get the price down, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. I hope this is a price you're comfortable with.",825000.0,Alice,5,
