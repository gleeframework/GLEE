"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal considering the value it holds. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal from Alice before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** This counteroffer aims for a significant saving while still being potentially acceptable to Alice. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting lower allows for some back-and-forth negotiation before reaching a potential agreement or needing to consider John's offer more seriously. 
* **Polite and Professional:** Maintaining a positive tone encourages continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, but she's still above John's offer.  It's worth one more counteroffer to see if we can get closer to $1,200,000 before accepting her offer or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming closer. I'm getting closer to what I can do.  How about $1,225,000?  That's a firm offer on my end."",
""product_price"": 1225000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer meets Alice halfway between her last offer and my previous one, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Firm Offer:**  By stating it's a ""firm offer,"" I'm signaling to Alice that this is my final price, and I'm willing to walk away if she doesn't accept. 
* **Still Above John:** While this is my final offer to Alice, it's important to remember I still have the option of John's $1,200,000 price if needed."
