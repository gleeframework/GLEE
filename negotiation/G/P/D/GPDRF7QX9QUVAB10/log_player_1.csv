"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I know will be incredibly valuable to your business. My asking price is $950,000, which I believe reflects its true potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $750,000. I believe we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a specific price point. While I appreciate your offer, I need to maintain a value closer to the product's potential. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it still reflects the value you'll gain from this product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $800,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the value of the product and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more, I'm happy to close the deal at this point.  It's a good outcome, and it avoids the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially losing the deal entirely."
