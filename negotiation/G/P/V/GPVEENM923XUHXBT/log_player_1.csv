{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and it gives you a good opportunity to make a profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's estimated value:** This incentivizes him to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:**  You have room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  It lays out your offer and encourages a response. 

Remember, you can always adjust your price depending on Bob's response, or switch to selling to John if you feel the negotiation is going nowhere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm willing to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  You have a strong alternative with John, who is willing to pay your minimum. Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to save money, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a higher price to make this work.  How about $1,100,000?  It's a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and still allows you to make a good profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:**  You've moved closer to Bob's price, showing flexibility.  However, you're still above his offer, signaling that you're not desperate to sell.
* **Emphasize Value:**  You reiterate that you're offering a good deal, reminding Bob of the product's value.
* **Focus on Compromise:**  You frame your counteroffer as a compromise, suggesting a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Positive Tone:**  You maintain a friendly and cooperative tone, encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the value it brings. Can we meet in the middle at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  You have a guaranteed sale to John at a much higher price. It's not worth risking a lower price when you have a secure alternative. By rejecting Bob's offer, you keep the option of potentially getting a higher offer from Bob, but also retain the safety net of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to see a price closer to $1,100,000 to make this work.  How about $1,075,000?  It's a reasonable price that allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** You've moved slightly closer to Bob's offer but are still holding a higher ground. 
* **Focus on Compromise:**  You reiterate your willingness to compromise but emphasize the need for a price closer to your previous offer.
* **Positive Tone:**  You maintain a friendly and enthusiastic tone, encouraging Bob to finalize the deal.

This counteroffer balances the need to make a deal with the desire to secure a higher price.  It sets the stage for a potential final agreement and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000, but I need to take a small discount to make it work for me. Can we do $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has offered a price that's closer to your counteroffer, it's still below your minimum acceptable price.  Since you have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000, it's more beneficial to accept his offer. You'll earn significantly more money by selling to John, and it eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might lead to a lower price."
