"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about we split the difference and I pay $13500?",13500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $14000. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go over $13000.  If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with another seller.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13500. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,
