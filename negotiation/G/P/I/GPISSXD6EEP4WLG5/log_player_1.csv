Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm interested, but I'd need to see it closer to $8,500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than his initial offer, it's still significantly lower than what I need to make a profit. I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $12,000. I will try to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to go down to $9,500. This still leaves room for both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $9,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied. I want to see if I can push for something closer to $10,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position, but $9,000 still doesn't quite work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 9250}
