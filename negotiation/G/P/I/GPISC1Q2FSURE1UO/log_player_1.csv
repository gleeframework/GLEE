Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's something you're interested in, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm asking for $19,000, which reflects its true worth and potential. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, I can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Emphasis on value:**  The message highlights the product's worth and potential to justify the high price. 
* **Exclusivity:**  Framing the offer as ""exclusive"" aims to make Bob feel special and potentially more willing to pay a premium.

**It's important to note:** This is an aggressive opening offer.  While Bob might accept, a counter-offer is more likely. This strategy aims to maximize profit but carries the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright."
