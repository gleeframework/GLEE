"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  Let me know what you think.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $975,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you the product for $1,012,500. This is a good compromise and a fair price for both of us.",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting close.  I'm willing to offer $990,000. This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.",990000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate.  While $990,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal considering the value of the product.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
