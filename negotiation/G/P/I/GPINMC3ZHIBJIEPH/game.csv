"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,200,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While $1,200,000 is a reasonable starting point, I'm working with a slightly tighter budget. Would you be willing to come down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer to a number that works for me. How about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,050,000, which is $1,075,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're tough!  I can tell we both want to make this work.  How about we split the difference one last time and land at $1,062,500?  That's my final offer.",1062500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,062,500. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I need to let you know that if we don't come to an agreement, I'll be forced to consider other options, including selling the product to a third party. I'm hoping we can still make this work, but I need a bit more room to breathe.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
