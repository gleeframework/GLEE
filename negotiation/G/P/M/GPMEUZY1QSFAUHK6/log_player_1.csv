Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  $1,100,000 is still a good deal for Bob, giving him a potential profit of $100,000.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This ensures you're not immediately losing money if Bob accepts.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, you can adjust your offer based on his counteroffer.

**Important Note:**  The key is to be flexible and willing to negotiate. If Bob rejects your initial offer, you'll need to assess the situation and adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your price. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to me is $1000000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and even lower than your initial offer of $1,100,000. While it's tempting to accept $900,000 since it's higher than Bob's perceived value, it's still too low for you.  

**Next Steps:**

You should reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. You could try:

* **Meeting halfway:** Offer a price of $1,000,000, acknowledging Bob's value but still ensuring a reasonable profit for yourself.
* **Lowering slightly:** Offer a price of $950,000. This shows flexibility while still remaining above your minimum. 

It's important to gauge Bob's negotiation style and be prepared to adjust your strategy accordingly. If Bob seems determined to pay only $900,000, you might consider selling to John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000,  which I believe is a fair compromise. This still gives you a good profit margin, and it's closer to my minimum. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer represents a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between your previous offer of $1,100,000 and his offer of $900,000.
* **Still above your minimum:** $950,000 is still higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, ensuring you don't lose money.
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the potential profit for Bob and frames the offer as a fair compromise. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Monitor Bob's reaction:** Carefully analyze Bob's response. If he still refuses, you may need to consider selling to John.
* **Be prepared to negotiate further:**  If Bob counteroffers again, be ready to adjust your offer accordingly.
* **Maintain a balance:**  Avoid being too rigid or too flexible in your negotiation. Remember your goal is to maximize your profit while keeping the deal viable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $920000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I can get out of it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer of $920,000 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, considering you've already dropped your price twice, it's becoming increasingly clear that Bob is unlikely to meet your minimum requirements. 

**Why Sell to John:**

* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees you a profit of $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's current offer.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially lowering your final price.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While you could keep trying to negotiate with Bob, there's no guarantee he'll ever come close to your desired price. Selling to John eliminates this risk and provides you with a certain outcome.

**Conclusion:**

It's a wise decision to sell to John at this point. You've secured a better price, saved time, and minimized risk.  It's always important to prioritize your own financial goals and cut your losses if necessary."
