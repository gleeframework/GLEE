"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your price. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to me is $1000000.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950000,  which I believe is a fair compromise. This still gives you a good profit margin, and it's closer to my minimum. Let's see if we can make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $920000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I can get out of it.",920000.0,Bob,4,
