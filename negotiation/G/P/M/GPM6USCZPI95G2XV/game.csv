"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than its market value.  Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the discount, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $1,050,000 is still below my desired price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $1,100,000. It's still a great deal for you, given the product's worth. Let me know if you're interested.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle, how about $1,075,000?  Let's close this deal!",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $1,075,000 is a fair price, but I'm willing to come down just a little further to $1,090,000. This is a good compromise and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let's close this deal.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
