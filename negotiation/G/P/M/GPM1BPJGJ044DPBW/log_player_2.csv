"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $200. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is much higher than my budget and John's price. I should make a counteroffer significantly lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation while staying within a reasonable range of my budget and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $200 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $175? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is negotiating, $175 is still too high. I'll counteroffer closer to my limit and John's price to see if there's room to make a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to do it for $130?"",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

This counteroffer moves closer to my maximum budget and John's price, while still offering Alice a potential discount.  It will be interesting to see how she responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. How about we meet in the middle again at $162.50? It's a good compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $162.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $162.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is slowly coming down, but $162.50 is still too high. I'm getting close to John's price, so I'll make one more counteroffer close to my limit. If she rejects it, I'll go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here, but I can't go higher than $140.  That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

This counteroffer is my last attempt to get a deal with Alice. It's a fair compromise, still lower than her previous offer but higher than John's price.  If she rejects this, I'll buy from John to stay within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll meet you at $155. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unwilling to go below $155, and while it's close to my budget, John offers the product for $150. It makes more sense to buy from John at this point and save the extra $5."
