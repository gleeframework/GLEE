"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't quite meet you at $9000. I'm willing to consider a price of $14000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,,

"I understand that $12000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $14000. How about $13000?",13000.0,Alice,5,,

"I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $12500? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but it's still a great deal for you.",12500.0,Alice,7,,

"I'm sorry, Bob, but $10000 is way too low for me. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I think we're getting close, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about $11500? It's the last concession I'm willing to make.",11500.0,Alice,9,,
