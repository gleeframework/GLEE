"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  It's still a fair price, and I believe you'll get your money's worth. What do you say?",160.0,Alice,3,
