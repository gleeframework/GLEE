"Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $10,500 isn't quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  Let's get this deal done.",10750.0,Alice,5,
