"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get the product for a lower price than $14,000.  Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as low a price as possible. By offering $13,000, Bob is showing Alice that he is serious about buying the product but is also willing to negotiate. This offer is a good starting point for further negotiation, as it is still within Bob's budget and leaves room for Alice to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what he'd like to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to push for a lower price in the next round.  It's important to remember that Bob can always buy from John for $15,000, so he has leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating his willingness to compromise while still trying to get a good deal.  $13,500 is a reasonable midpoint between Bob's previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving and gives Alice a chance to accept before Bob potentially decides to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,550. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,550
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only slightly lower than John's price, and at this point, the negotiation isn't moving in Bob's favor.  While Bob could keep making counteroffers, it's likely that Alice will continue to counter with prices close to her bottom line. Buying from John ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of getting stuck in a protracted negotiation."
