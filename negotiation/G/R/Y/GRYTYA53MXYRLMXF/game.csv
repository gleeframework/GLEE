"Alice, your product looks great, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is at $95.  Let me know if that works for you.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
