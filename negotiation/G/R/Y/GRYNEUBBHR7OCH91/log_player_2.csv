"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still above my target price. There's room for negotiation, and I can try to get a better price. I'm not ready to buy from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,300,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand you see the value in this product, but $1,000,000 is a significant difference from my initial asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?  This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,175,000 is still within my budget and represents a significant reduction from her initial asking price.  While I'd prefer a lower price, it's a reasonable compromise.  Buying from John at $1,500,000 would cost me significantly more, so accepting Alice's offer is the best option at this point."
