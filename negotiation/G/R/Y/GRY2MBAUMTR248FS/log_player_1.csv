``` 

This offer is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, making it enticing but still leaving room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a sale closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really need to stay within a tight budget, and that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum threshold of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and attempt to counter with a price closer to my desired value."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That's still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $10,000 to you.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really hoping we can meet in the middle here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $9,800 is a slight improvement, it's still significantly lower than my minimum threshold of $15,000.  I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired value.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob, as I may be able to close a deal closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try $10,000.  It's a fair price for both of us - you get a great deal on a product worth $10,000 to you, and I get closer to my asking price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
