"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really need to stay within a tight budget, and that's the highest I can go.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That's still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $10,000 to you.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really hoping we can meet in the middle here.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try $10,000.  It's a fair price for both of us - you get a great deal on a product worth $10,000 to you, and I get closer to my asking price.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
