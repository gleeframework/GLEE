"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There are 9 rounds left, so there's time to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  I'm willing to pay $12,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a moderately aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a price point that is closer to his maximum willingness to pay while still leaving room for negotiation. This counteroffer signals to Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,250 is closer to Bob's desired price point, he still has room to negotiate. He wants to save as much money as possible and knows that Alice is motivated to sell. There are still 7 rounds left, so Bob can continue to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet at $13,000? That would be a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but his offer is now closer to Alice's previous offer.  This shows Alice that he is willing to negotiate in good faith and is genuinely interested in buying the product. By offering $13,000, Bob is demonstrating a willingness to be flexible while still trying to secure the best possible price."
