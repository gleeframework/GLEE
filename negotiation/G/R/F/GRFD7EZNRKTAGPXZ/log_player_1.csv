"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,700,000.  This is a significant premium on Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm confident that I can get closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 over the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to sell for anything less than my minimum. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,400,000. This is still a good amount above Bob's initial offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While it's a slight increase, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's so far below my minimum. I'm going to keep negotiating, but I'm also starting to consider selling to John as we're nearing the halfway point of the rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm dropping my price again to $1,200,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on.  I'm still holding out for a better price, but I need to start closing the gap. If Bob rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not enough. I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'm starting to feel the pressure. We're getting close to the halfway point, and if we can't reach a deal, I'll have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,100,000.  I'm trying to make one last push before seriously considering selling to John. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a sign of my willingness to compromise. If he rejects this, I'll likely accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a critical point in the negotiation.  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're approaching the end of the rounds.  It's a gamble, but I'm going to sell to John. I'm guaranteed a good profit, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
