Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

```

**Reasoning:**  While a deal with Bob might still be possible, his offer is increasing in smaller increments. It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. Accepting John's offer guarantees the $1,000,000 and avoids the risk of Bob's negotiations stalling below that amount."
