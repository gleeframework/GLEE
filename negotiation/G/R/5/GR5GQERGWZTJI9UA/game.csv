"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer the product for $1,175,000? This leaves room for both of us to walk away happy. Let's keep the conversation going! ",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,125,000. Can you consider this compromise?",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,125,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
