```

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,125,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:** I'm maintaining a persistent approach, showing Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but also sticking to my minimum requirements.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000, which is the highest I'm comfortable going. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum of $1,500,000.  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and it seems unlikely we'll reach an agreement that satisfies my minimum price.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  This guarantees me a satisfactory profit, and I don't want to risk further negotiation that could lead to a lower price."
