"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value. However, I'm confident this product is worth a significant investment. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $11,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your commitment to finding a price that works for both of us. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our conversation and believe you would benefit greatly from this product. Let's settle this now - would $12,500 work for you?",12500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me halfway?",11500.0,Bob,6,
