# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. I think it's a fair price considering its value and the benefits it can bring to you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  You have room to go lower than $9,500 before reaching your maximum price from John."

Alice's offer:

I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

While Alice's offer is better than her initial one, you still have room to negotiate further before reaching John's price.  It's worth trying to get closer to your target price of $8,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a compromise. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not willing to go as high as $8500. I'm willing to offer $8200, which is closer to your proposed price. I think this is a fair compromise that would allow us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200.

Alice's offer of $8,200 is very close to your target price of $8,000.  It's likely you won't be able to get a lower price from Alice, and you're saving $3,800 compared to buying from John.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most financially beneficial choice."
