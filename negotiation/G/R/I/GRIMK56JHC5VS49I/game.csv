Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. I think it's a fair price considering its value and the benefits it can bring to you.,9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the information about the product's value. I'm interested in making a deal, but $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $8000? This is a fair price that allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still interested in this product but $9000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8500? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a compromise. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not willing to go as high as $8500. I'm willing to offer $8200, which is closer to your proposed price. I think this is a fair compromise that would allow us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8200.0,Alice,5,
