Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value, I'm giving him a chance to counter-offer.  If he rejects, I can always fall back on John's guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is a decent profit, I believe I can get closer to my target price.  I'll counter-offer in the next round, aiming for a compromise between his offer and my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer. It's a reasonable price that still offers a good profit margin.  I hope Bob will see the value and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a bit more, $1,250,000 is a good profit and a fair compromise.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether, and John's offer is not as lucrative."
