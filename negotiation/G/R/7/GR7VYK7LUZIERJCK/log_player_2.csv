Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $850,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $950,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy. Let's meet in the middle.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're aiming for $900,000, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $925,000 feels more fair to me, considering the product's value. This price gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can close this deal.

Round 6

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to split the difference. However, $912,500 is still a bit low for me, considering the product's value. Let's try $920,000. This gives us both a fair deal while staying within a reasonable range. I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $920,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's offer and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing."
