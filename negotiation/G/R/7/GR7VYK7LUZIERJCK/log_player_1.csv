"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal considering its true value. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate but still leaving me with a profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I subtly mention the ""true value"" of the product to emphasize its worth and justify my price.

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize my profit:** I'm starting high, giving me more room to negotiate downwards.
* **Maintain leverage:**  If Bob rejects my initial offer, I can still make counteroffers or choose to sell to John for $1,200,000 if necessary.
* **Build a positive relationship:** A friendly approach helps set a positive tone for the negotiation, increasing the chances of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's also far below my initial offer of $1,100,000, indicating he's not willing to compromise much.

By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Maintain my leverage:** I can counteroffer and try to get a price closer to my desired range.
* **Signal my seriousness:** Rejecting a low offer shows Bob that I'm not desperate to sell and that I have other options.
* **Avoid a bad deal:** Accepting $850,000 would result in a substantial loss for me. 

I will counteroffer with a price higher than $850,000 but lower than my initial $1,100,000, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $850,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $950,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm offering a price higher than Bob's $850,000 but lower than my initial $1,100,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a reasonable profit.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and cooperative tone, emphasizing the goal of reaching a mutually agreeable outcome. 
* **""Meet in the middle"" phrasing:** This implies a collaborative approach and signals that I'm open to further negotiation.

This counteroffer strategically balances:

* **Profit Maximization:** While I'm lowering my price, it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer, giving me a better deal. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** By staying firm on my minimum acceptable price and showing flexibility, I maintain control over the negotiation.
* **Relationship Building:** A positive and collaborative tone helps maintain a good rapport with Bob, improving the chances of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $950,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $900,000.  Would you be willing to settle at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, it's still a significant loss for me. I'm not desperate to sell and have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $1,200,000. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:**  I can continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming for a higher price.
* **Signal my seriousness:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows him that I'm not willing to settle for a price below my minimum.
* **Maximize my profit:**  Accepting $900,000 would result in a substantial loss, whereas selling to John would guarantee a higher profit.

In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than $900,000, aiming for a more acceptable compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for $900,000, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $925,000 feels more fair to me, considering the product's value. This price gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's $900,000 but still lower than my previous offer of $950,000. This shows flexibility while maintaining my leverage.
* **Value Justification:** I reiterate the product's value to justify my price and emphasize that it's not just about getting the highest possible number.
* **""Good deal"" emphasis:**  I frame the price as a win-win situation for both of us, promoting a sense of mutual benefit.
* **Closing call:**  I subtly encourage Bob to close the deal with a phrase like ""Let's see if we can close this deal."" This adds a sense of urgency and encourages a final decision.

This counteroffer strategically:

* **Maximizes profit:** I'm moving closer to my desired price point while still offering a reasonable compromise.
* **Maintains negotiation control:** By rejecting his previous offer and proposing a new price, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we both deserve a fair deal.  How about we split the difference and settle at $912,500?  That seems like a win-win to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $912,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a significant loss for me.  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $1,200,000, and I'm not willing to settle for a much lower price just to close a deal quickly.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maximize my profit:**  I'm not desperate to sell and can continue to negotiate for a better price.
* **Maintain leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows him that I'm not willing to settle for a price that doesn't meet my minimum requirements.
* **Avoid a bad deal:** Accepting $912,500 would result in a substantial loss, whereas selling to John would guarantee a much higher profit.

In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than $912,500, aiming for a more acceptable compromise that gets me closer to my minimum price."
