"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it offers significant value, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is tempting, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $12,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her or get closer to your ideal price point."
