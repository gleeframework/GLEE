Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it offers significant value, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible, maximizing profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still staying above your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net. You don't need to go below that price."
