"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
