"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $14,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to drop the price to $16,000.  This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit, and it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,
