Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and potential.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to maximize my potential profit. It's important to remember I have a safety net of $800,000 with John. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for the price to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The message ends with a question, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer and start a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is the same as John's offer, and since I have a guaranteed $800,000 from John, there's no point in risking further negotiation."
