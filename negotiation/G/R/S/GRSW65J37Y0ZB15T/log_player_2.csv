"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, we're confident it's worth more than $80 to you. Considering its true worth, I propose a special introductory price of $100 for you. This is an excellent opportunity to experience the benefits of our product at a discounted rate compared to its market value of $120. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is less than your maximum budget of $120 and significantly cheaper than buying from John for $120. While Alice's message includes some sales tactics (emphasizing value and a ""discounted"" price), the bottom line is that her offer saves you money."
