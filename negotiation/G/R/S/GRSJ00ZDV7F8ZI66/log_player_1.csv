Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can reach a better agreement. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is closer to his value than mine. I'll try to negotiate for a higher price before accepting or resorting to John."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my initial offer of $140. It seems to be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140.

Bob seems firm on $140.  It's unlikely further negotiation will get me significantly closer to my desired price. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable price."
