{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It's also friendly and engaging to build rapport with Bob.  It's a good starting point for a successful negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $9,000 is a decent offer, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $9,000 is a good offer. However, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500?  It's a fair price for the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,800 is very close to my minimum price of $8,000. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'd rather sell to Bob than John at this point."
