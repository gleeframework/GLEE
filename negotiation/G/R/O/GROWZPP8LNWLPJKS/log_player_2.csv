{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* We are in the 9th round, with only one round left. 
* Alice's offer of $6,050 is closer to my target price of $5,950. 
* I'm concerned that if I reject the offer and make a counter-offer, Alice might not accept it, leaving me with only one round to buy from John at a higher price.
* Accepting the offer allows me to secure the product for a price that is relatively close to my target, saving me $1,950 compared to buying from John."
