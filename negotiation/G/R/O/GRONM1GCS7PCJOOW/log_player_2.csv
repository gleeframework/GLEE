"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I believe it's worth a premium price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above your maximum acceptable price. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or proceed to buy from John for $12,000. While buying from John is more expensive than Alice's current offer, it's still within your budget and leaves room for potential savings if you can get Alice to lower her price further."
