Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, and it's better to explore all options before buying from John at the full price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to budge.  A $50,000 drop is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and it shows that I'm serious about getting a good deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to counter again to see if we can bridge the gap.  It's still too early to consider buying from John at the full price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $925,000. This shows I'm willing to meet Alice halfway, but still trying to get a better deal than her last offer.  We're getting closer to a potential agreement, and I want to see if she's willing to accept a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is being stubborn, but I'm still determined to get a better price.  I'll counter again, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'm not ready to give up yet, as the product is valuable and I still have time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final push to try and secure a deal close to my target price.  This counteroffer is a compromise, and it shows Alice that I'm serious about closing the deal but still want a good price.  I'm hoping she'll be willing to accept it. If she rejects, I'll reconsider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $955,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $955,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my target price, and we're only a few rounds away from the deal deadline. It's likely that we'll continue to haggle back and forth, potentially getting stuck in a loop. While I'd prefer a lower price,  $955,000 is a good deal considering the alternative of buying from John for $1,000,000. It's time to close the deal and secure the product."
