"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I really appreciate it, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $85?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate you showing interest.  While $85 is tempting, I'm not able to go that low right now.  How about $95? That's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $90.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a bit below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $92.50?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product worth it.  Let me know your thoughts.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $91.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I really want to close this deal.  Let's see if we can make it happen.",91.0,Bob,6,
