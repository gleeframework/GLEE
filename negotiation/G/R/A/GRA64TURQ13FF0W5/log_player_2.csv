Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I really appreciate it, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $85?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate you showing interest.  While $85 is tempting, I'm not able to go that low right now.  How about $95? That's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $90.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a bit below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $92.50?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product worth it.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $91.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I really want to close this deal.  Let's see if we can make it happen."", ""product_price"": 91}
