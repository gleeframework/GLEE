{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also signals to Bob that you are serious about selling to him, but are willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what you'd like to get for the product.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price, as there's still a potential for a profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,400,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,375,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,375,000 is very close to your desired price and is above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's a good deal, and there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a lower offer from Bob or even him walking away.  Accepting his offer is the best option at this point."
