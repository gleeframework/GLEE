Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll be very interested in.  I'm asking for $20,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $20000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't afford that.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum value. I'm going to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  While $8,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $14,000?  This would still leave me with a reasonable profit, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $14000 is still a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $10000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I believe there's more room for negotiation, and I'm going to try for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I can't go below $12,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. $12000 is still a little out of my comfort zone.  Would you consider $11000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not sure Bob will come up any further.  Rather than risk another round of negotiation, I'm going to sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I get a fair price for the product."
