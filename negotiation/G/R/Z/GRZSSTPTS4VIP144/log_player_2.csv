"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll be very interested in.  I'm asking for $20000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$20,000 is far above my budget. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't afford that.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  While $8000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $14000?  This would still leave me with a reasonable profit, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $14,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10000 is still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I can't go below $12000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

I'm still hoping to get the price down a bit more. I'll make another counteroffer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. $12,000 is still a little out of my comfort zone.  Would you consider $11,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my budget."", ""product_price"": 11000}
