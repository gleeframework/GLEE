"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. While I want to close a deal,  $1,000,000 is not acceptable.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum, but it's a lower price than my first offer to show flexibility and encourage Bob to come closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired range. I want to see if I can push him a little higher. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,250,000. This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about selling to him, but also that I won't settle for anything significantly below my desired price."
