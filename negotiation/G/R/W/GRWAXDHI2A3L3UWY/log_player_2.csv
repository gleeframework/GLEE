"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $100. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's opening offer is significantly higher than her value for the product ($80). There's a good chance I can negotiate a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little too high for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge her flexibility. 
* **Anchoring:** By throwing out the number $70, I'm trying to anchor the negotiation closer to Alice's estimated value of the product ($80). Even if she doesn't accept this offer, it might make her more receptive to a price in the $70-$80 range.
* **Alternative Option:** I always have John's offer of $120 in my back pocket. If Alice isn't willing to negotiate down to a reasonable price, I can walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85? That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to her estimated value, but $85 is still a significant markup. I think there's room to negotiate further. I'll make another counteroffer closer to her value, but I'm also mindful of John's $120 offer as a potential fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That's a fair price for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):**  Alice counter-offered with $85, effectively splitting the difference between her previous offer ($100) and my counter ($70). By offering $75, I'm signaling willingness to compromise, but still pushing for a price closer to her estimated value.
* **Time Pressure:**  Each round of negotiation takes time. While I'm aiming for the best possible deal, I also recognize that John's offer is a viable alternative if Alice proves unwilling to budge much further."
