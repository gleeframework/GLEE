Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it also leaves room for negotiation and hopefully allows me to secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than my ideal selling price. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $9,500 by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable price for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is consistent with his previous offer, and while it's not ideal, it's still higher than selling to John.  It's time to take the deal to avoid the risk of further negotiation potentially resulting in a lower offer or a rejection that would force me to sell to John for a lower price."
