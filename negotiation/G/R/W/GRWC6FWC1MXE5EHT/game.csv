"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $10,000 at this time.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $14,000. This is still a great value considering the benefits the product will bring to your business.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go down to $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
