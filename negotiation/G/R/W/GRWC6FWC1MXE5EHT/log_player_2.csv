Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go down to $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down on her price, she's unlikely to reach my $12,000 limit in the remaining rounds. It's better to secure the product from John at my target price than risk Alice not budging further."
