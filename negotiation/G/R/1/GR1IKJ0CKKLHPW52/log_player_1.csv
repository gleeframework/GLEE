{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's in great condition and worth every penny! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than your minimum but leaves room for potential compromise. It also includes a friendly message to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $140 is a bit above my budget.  How about $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and $130 is closer to what I'm looking for. However, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. How about we split the difference and go with $135?  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
