Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,400,000 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is a significant price reduction and reflects my desire to reach an agreement. Let's find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1750000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000 again. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge from his offer, and I'm running out of time.  I've already rejected his counteroffer twice.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the best option right now to ensure I get a price that meets my minimum requirement."
