Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your pricing. However, I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $180?

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $180 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $190? I'm confident you'll find it's a great value at that price."", ""product_price"": 190}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $170 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. How about we split the difference and settle at $180?  It's a final offer."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I am still looking to keep within my budget. I would like to propose $165 as my offer for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently negotiating downwards and is unlikely to meet the $170 mark I've tried to establish. It's better to take the guaranteed $150 from John than to risk getting a lower offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
