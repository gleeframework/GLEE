Round 6
Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","This is a tough one.  Bob is really close to our fallback price with John. Let's assess:

* **Accept Bob's Offer:** We make $11,500, which is a decent profit.
* **Reject and Counter:** We risk Bob walking away, or another round of haggling might not get us much higher.
* **Sell to John:**  This is our safety net, guaranteeing $12,000.

It's a close call, but the risk of losing the deal with Bob is higher than the potential gain from further negotiation.
