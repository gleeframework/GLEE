Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. We understand your budget constraints, but we're still not willing to go below $800,000. We're willing to make one more concession and offer the product at a price of $825,000. We believe this is the best compromise considering the value the product can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

It's unlikely Alice will go below $800,000. John offers the product at that price, making it the best option to ensure you stay within budget.  Continuing negotiations with Alice has a higher risk with potentially little reward."
