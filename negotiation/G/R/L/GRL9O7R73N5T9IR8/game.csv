"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I see in it. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I believe this product holds even greater value, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to find a fair deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still above my maximum budget. I'm confident this product is valuable to you, but for me, $950,000 is the highest I can go. This offer represents a good deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
