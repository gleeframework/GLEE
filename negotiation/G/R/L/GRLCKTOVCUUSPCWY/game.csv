"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the exclusivity, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1500000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and the market value of similar products.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $1750000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1600000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on this product. I hope we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility in adjusting the price.  However,  $1650000 is still slightly higher than I can comfortably go at this time.  I'm prepared to offer $1625000.
