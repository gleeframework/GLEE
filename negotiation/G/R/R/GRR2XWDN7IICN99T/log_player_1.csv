"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob.  I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, so I have some room to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  How about $1,050,000?  That's a significant discount from my initial price and still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $950,000? That's the highest price I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $950,000 is getting closer to what I want, I can still get $1,000,000 from John.  I'll see if I can get Bob to come up a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $950,000, but I'm still a bit off from what I need.  How about $975,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I believe we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but that's as low as I can go. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but we're still a bit apart.  At this point, I'm not sure if I'll be able to get him to go higher.  It's better to secure the $1,000,000 from John and move on."
