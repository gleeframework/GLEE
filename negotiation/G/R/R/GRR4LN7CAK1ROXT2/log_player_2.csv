Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks great, $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider something closer to $6,000?"", ""product_price"": 6000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $9,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value the product brings. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $7,500. Considering the value the product brings, I'd like to counteroffer at $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
 
Alice is unlikely to go much lower than her current offer of $10,000.  It's better to secure the product from John at $8,000 and avoid the risk of the negotiation failing altogether."
