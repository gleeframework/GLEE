"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not quite there. I can offer you a slight discount to $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
