"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. I'm confident this price reflects its worth, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm confident I can find another buyer who values it accordingly. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to accept $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's close this deal!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned, and it's my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
