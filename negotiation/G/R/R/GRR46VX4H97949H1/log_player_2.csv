{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can definitely get a better deal than $950,000.  Alice is willing to sell for less than that, and you have room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for Alice to profit. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, considering your maximum price is $1,200,000."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $925,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above what you're willing to pay. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get Alice closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's closer to Alice's latest offer, showing you're serious about negotiating. It's also still within your budget and leaves room for Alice to make a profit. This should hopefully entice Alice to accept and end the negotiation."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $915,000.  While this is still more than your initial counteroffer, it's getting closer to your ideal price.  At this point, continuing to negotiate might drag out the process and increase the risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away.  It's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a good price."
