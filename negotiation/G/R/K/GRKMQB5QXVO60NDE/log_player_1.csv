Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $110. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer sets a price higher than your minimum but still lower than the value to Bob. It starts the negotiation with a fair offer that might encourage Bob to accept, while still giving you room to potentially negotiate higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than selling to John, it is still lower than my desired price. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $100? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair price."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? That's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, $95 is close to my desired range and significantly better than selling to John for $80. Accepting Bob's offer secures a good deal for me."
