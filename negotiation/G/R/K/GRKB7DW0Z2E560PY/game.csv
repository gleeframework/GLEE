"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the fact that I could easily sell it to someone else for $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested.",13500.0,Alice,1,
