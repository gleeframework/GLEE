Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I believe we can find a price closer to my budget. How about we aim for $900,000? This would allow us both to be satisfied with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's within my minimum, and it avoids the risk of losing the sale and having to deal with John.  It's a good outcome for both of us."
