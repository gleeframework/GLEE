"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm asking for $1,400,000 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  There are 9 more rounds to work with, so there's time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to offer $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial ask.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing some flexibility, $1,300,000 is still too high. I'm comfortable with a price closer to $1,200,000 and there are still many rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,300,000 is still above my target. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This feels like a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still looking for a slightly higher number. Would you be willing to consider $1,275,000?  This feels like a strong offer for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $1,275,000 is a price I'm comfortable with.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away and I'll have to buy from John at a much higher price. This seems like a good compromise to close the deal."
