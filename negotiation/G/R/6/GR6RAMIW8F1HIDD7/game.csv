"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm asking for $1,400,000 to start. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to offer $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial ask.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,300,000 is still above my target. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This feels like a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product. Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still looking for a slightly higher number. Would you be willing to consider $1,275,000?  This feels like a strong offer for both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
