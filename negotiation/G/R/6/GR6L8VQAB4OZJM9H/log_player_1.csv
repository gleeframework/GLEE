Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $12,000. I think it would be a valuable asset to you, and this price reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, you should aim higher with Bob. 
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $12,000 gives you room to negotiate down if needed, while still potentially securing a significant profit.
* **Confident Justification:**  Phrasing like ""true worth"" subtly suggests the product's value might even exceed the asking price.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. If you want to be absolutely sure of a sale, you could offer a price closer to $8,000."
