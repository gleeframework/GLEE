This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum threshold of $1,200,000 and leaves room for negotiation while still being attractive to Bob, who values the product at $1,500,000.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product is worth it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold of $1,200,000. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than that. I will counteroffer Bob to keep the negotiation going."
