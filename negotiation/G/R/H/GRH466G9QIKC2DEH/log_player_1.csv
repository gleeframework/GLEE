"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It also leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal, as the product is worth $15,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I can still do better.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's less than what the product is worth to him, and it's closer to my initial offer, giving me a better return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm not willing to sell to John yet as I'm confident I can get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13200}

I'm going to counter with $13,200. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but still a good deal for Bob, and I'm hoping it will convince him to accept."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, so I'm willing to drop my price a little bit more.  This is a good deal for both of us, as I'm getting close to my desired price, and Bob is still getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob isn't willing to go any higher, and I'm running out of negotiation rounds.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, selling to John guarantees me my minimum, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all."
