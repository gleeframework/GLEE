"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's in great condition and worth a lot to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value and condition to entice Bob.
* **Open Ended Question:**  I'm asking Bob for his opinion, opening the door for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I have more rounds to work with and John is a guaranteed $150 sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $140.  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counteroffer that's closer to his initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing the value of the product to me.
* **Focus on Benefits:** I'm highlighting how a $140 price is still a good deal for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still too low:** While $130 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired outcome.
* **Potential for higher:** I believe there's still room for negotiation and that I can get closer to my target price. 
* **John is the backup:** Selling to John for $150 is still a solid option, but I'm not ready to give up on a better deal with Bob yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $135? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a lower price and suggesting a compromise. 
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair deal for both parties.
* **Final Offer?**  I'm leaving a hint that this may be my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125, and that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Too Low:** Bob's offer of $125 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not willing to go that low.
* **Time is Running Out:** We're already in Round 6, and with only 4 rounds left, the risk of not getting a better deal increases.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John for $150 ensures I reach my minimum target and avoids further negotiation that may lead to a worse outcome. 

It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed sale."
