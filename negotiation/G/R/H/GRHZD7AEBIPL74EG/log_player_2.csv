{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  There's potential to negotiate a better price.  You should reject the offer and see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move to show I'm serious about negotiating and to see if Alice is willing to move significantly from her initial position.  I'm aiming for a price that's still attractive to me while leaving room for potential compromises in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still lower than my maximum budget, but closer than her initial offer. I'm still optimistic about negotiating a better price, so I'll reject and see if we can reach a compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to find a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but am still pushing for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $575,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my desired price.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of her rejecting further offers and me ending up having to buy from John for a much higher price is increasing.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price, within my budget, and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity to buy from Alice entirely."
