"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love! I'm willing to let it go for $135.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

I need to try and get the price lower.  $135 is too close to my maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a nice product, but $135 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
 ""product_price"": 100

``` 
This is a starting point for negotiation. I'm aiming significantly lower than her initial offer, but leaving room to negotiate upward if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice has met my maximum budget. There's no point in rejecting and trying to negotiate lower, or buying from John for the same price."
