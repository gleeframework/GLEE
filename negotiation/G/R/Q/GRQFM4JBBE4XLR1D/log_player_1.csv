Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love! I'm willing to let it go for $135.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to Bob ($120). This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Not Too High:**  I'm not starting at my absolute minimum price of $150 because I want to entice Bob to negotiate.  
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly tone helps to build rapport and make Bob more open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a nice product, but $135 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** I have room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **John's offer:** While I could sell to John for $150, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.  There's always a chance I can make a counteroffer that he'll accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $120 is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer of $135 and Bob's offer of $100. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is a great deal for him, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Finality:**  I'm stating that $120 is my ""lowest I can go"" to create a sense of urgency and push Bob to accept."
