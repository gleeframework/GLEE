"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to start high, at my minimum acceptable price. I know Bob values the product at $10,000, so there's room for negotiation.  However, I want to see if he's willing to pay closer to my value.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price.  I'm not willing to sell for that much.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I still want to get as close to my minimum as possible.  $11,000 is a reasonable compromise, and hopefully Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $10,000, even though I'm running out of rounds. I'll counteroffer again, but if he rejects, I'll likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to drop my price to $10,500. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still a higher price than Bob's last offer. This shows him that I'm serious about reaching a deal, but I'm not willing to sell for much less.  If he rejects this offer, I will likely go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still only $100 away from my minimum acceptable price, but I'm running out of time. I'm not confident that we'll be able to reach a deal with only four rounds left.  It's better to sell to John for $12,000 and ensure I get the price I want."
