Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price is $15,000** because that's what John is willing to pay.
* **Bob values the product at $8,000**.  
* **I'm offering $14,000**. This is a significant discount from my minimum price, but it's still a good deal for me as it's above Bob's valuation.  This strategy increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer.

**By offering a price slightly above Bob's valuation, I increase my chances of a successful sale while still securing a profit significantly higher than what I would get if I sold to John.**"
