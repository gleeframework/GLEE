Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we also know we have a guaranteed sale at $10,000. Aiming high initially allows us to potentially secure a higher profit margin.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate down. He might counter-offer, and we can then gradually reduce the price, potentially settling somewhere above our minimum.
* **Exclusivity Incentive:**  By framing the offer as ""exclusive,"" we add a sense of urgency and value, potentially persuading Bob to act quickly. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. Depending on Bob's response, we might adjust our approach in subsequent messages to try and close the deal at the best possible price."
