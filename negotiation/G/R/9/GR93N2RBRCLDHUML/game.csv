"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  The product is worth more than that to me. How about we meet in the middle at $8250? I'm still confident you'll find this a great value.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $7800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8000, my minimum price. I'm sure you'll agree it's a great value for a product that's worth that much to you. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $7500. How about we meet at $7800 again, but this time I'll throw in some extras, like a free service or a discount on a future purchase? Can you consider that?",7800.0,Bob,6,
