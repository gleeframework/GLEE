"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for a bit more than $9,500.  How about $10,500? That's still a significant discount from its value to you, and it gives us both room to agree. Let me know your thoughts!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle somewhere. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up in your offer. How about $10,250? It's a small step closer to where we both might be happy. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $10,250, which would be $10,125. Can you consider that?",10125.0,Bob,6,
