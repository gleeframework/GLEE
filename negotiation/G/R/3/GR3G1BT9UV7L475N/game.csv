"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product!  While it looks great, $120 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I'm getting closer but $105 is still a tad more than I'd like to spend. Could you do $90?",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $98, which is as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great price for this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it. What do you think?",98.0,Alice,5,
