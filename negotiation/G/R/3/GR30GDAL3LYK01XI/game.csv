"Hi Bob, I have a product I'm looking to sell. I'm asking for $150 for it. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to spend no more than $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your interest, $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? I'm open to a little more flexibility to find a price that works for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Unfortunately, $115 is still above my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $95? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
