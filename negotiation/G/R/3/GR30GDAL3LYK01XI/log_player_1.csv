Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I'm looking to sell. I'm asking for $150 for it. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $150 initially leaves room for negotiation and ensures you're not immediately undervaluing your product.
* **Confidence and Value:** Highlighting the value of the product and expressing confidence in the offer can encourage Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Flexibility:** The message leaves the door open for counteroffers and further negotiation, while still establishing a clear starting point. 
* **Plan B:**  Remember, you have a guaranteed $100 from John, so you don't have to settle for anything less than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to spend no more than $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$80 is too low:** While $100 is your minimum acceptable price, you're still hoping to get a higher value from Bob.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer leaves open the possibility of further negotiation. You can counteroffer with a price closer to your desired range. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Remember, selling to John is a viable option, so you're not forced to accept a price you find unreasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your interest, $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? I'm open to a little more flexibility to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** The goal is to start a back-and-forth negotiation, aiming for a price closer to your desired value.
* **Compromise:** Offering $115 represents a compromise while still remaining above your minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Openness:** The message conveys a willingness to continue negotiating, encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** You're still in a strong position with John as a backup buyer, giving you the ability to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Unfortunately, $115 is still above my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $95? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  $95 is closer to your minimum acceptable price of $100, and you're likely to have trouble getting Bob to go much higher.
* **Avoid Stalemate:**  Rejecting Bob's offer risks a drawn-out negotiation with no guarantee of a better outcome.
* **Time is Money:**  Selling to Bob for $95 is a faster and more certain way to get a good price, especially since you have a backup option with John."
