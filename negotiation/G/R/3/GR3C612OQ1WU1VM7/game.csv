"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,100,000, which is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, and I respect that. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,050,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $1,050,000, but I'll throw in some additional perks or support to sweeten the deal?",1050000.0,Alice,5,,
