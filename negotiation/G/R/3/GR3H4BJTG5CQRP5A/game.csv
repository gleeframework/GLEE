"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects the true value you'll gain from it.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about we agree on $1,900,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me but $1,900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Could we settle on $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,350,000 is closer to a fair deal, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher number. Would you consider $1,700,000? I believe this reflects the value you're gaining while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you be open to $1,525,000?",1525000.0,Bob,6,
