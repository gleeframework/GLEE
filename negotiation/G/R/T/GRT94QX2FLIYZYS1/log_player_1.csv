Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob to encourage him to consider it.
* **Not too high:** I'm not aiming for the full $100 from John right away because I want to see if I can get a better deal from Bob.

This initial offer gives me a good starting point for the negotiation and allows me to see how Bob reacts to the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to earn as much money as possible.
* **Bob's offer:** While $90 is better than my minimum of $100, it's still lower than what I believe the product is worth.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I can likely get a better price from Bob by rejecting his offer and counter-offering. 
* **John's offer:** While $100 is a safe option, I'm not ready to settle for that yet, as I'm hoping to get closer to $120.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and try to secure a price closer to my desired $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still a little low for me.  How about $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm aiming for a price that's halfway between my initial offer ($120) and Bob's offer ($90). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive language:**  I'm using encouraging language to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Fair price:** I believe $105 is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the possibility of selling to John for $100. 
* **Confidence:**  Expressing confidence in the product and the offer can make Bob more likely to accept.

This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise that could lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit, but also recognizing that the negotiation is taking time and might lead to a delay in selling.
* **Bob's offer:**  $95 is only $5 less than what John is willing to pay, and it's a significant increase from Bob's previous offer.  
* **Time and risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to more rejections and a potential delay in selling the product.  It's also possible that Bob might walk away entirely.
* **Security of a sale:** $95 is a good price, and accepting it guarantees a sale and avoids further negotiation.

Given the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice, ensuring a quick sale at a price close to what John is willing to pay."
