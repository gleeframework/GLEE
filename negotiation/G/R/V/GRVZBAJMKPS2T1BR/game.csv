"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value you've placed on it. Let me know if you're interested in discussing further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $900,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too far from my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise a bit more and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. Can you meet me at this price?",975000.0,Bob,6,
