"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I think it's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm open to offers. Would you be interested in buying it for $150?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts with a relatively high price, reflecting my own valuation of the product. However, it leaves room for negotiation and signals my willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can potentially get more for the product. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. Would you be interested in paying $135?  It's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $135 is a good deal, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While $125 isn't my ideal price, it's still a significant profit and I'm starting to run out of negotiation rounds. There's a chance I could get a higher price in future rounds, but I'm also risking losing the deal altogether or having to sell to John for a lower price. It's better to secure a decent profit now than risk getting nothing."
