"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not too high to scare him off entirely. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully land a price closer to my goal of maximizing my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm not willing to accept such a low price.  I will continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $12,500.  This is still higher than Bob's initial offer but closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up with a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not high enough. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob. The fact that he's increased his offer shows he's willing to compromise, and I believe I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm offering $11,500, which is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's. This signals to Bob that I'm serious about a deal, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's too far below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial goal, I'm running out of time and don't want to risk losing the sale altogether.  Accepting this offer is the best option in this situation."
