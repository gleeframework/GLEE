"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a good price, Alice is aiming to maximize her profit and likely believes she can get closer to her desired $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows her to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about $9,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's still a good value for you considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 9500}
