"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. It's quite valuable, and I believe it would significantly benefit you. I'm initially offering it at $1,800,000.  I'm open to discussing terms, of course. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to offer $900,000 to start the negotiation.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider $1,500,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $1,500,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
