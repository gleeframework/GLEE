Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $950,000."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, starting high leaves room for negotiation and potential profit above John's offer.
* **Sense of exclusivity:** Highlighting that Bob has a limited-time opportunity before the product goes to John might encourage him to act quickly. 
* **Justification for the price:**  The message doesn't explicitly state why the price is so high.  This allows Bob to counter-offer and engage in a negotiation where Alice can gauge his interest level.

The goal is to find a balance between a price Bob might realistically accept and maximizing profit beyond John's guaranteed offer."
