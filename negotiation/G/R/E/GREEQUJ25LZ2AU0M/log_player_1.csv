"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 
 
I'm starting high, aiming for a profit of $400,000.  This is a strong starting position, leaving room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers. I'm also highlighting the value of the product for him, hoping to encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm rejecting it and will counteroffer in the next round to try to secure a more profitable deal.  While selling to John for $1,000,000 is tempting, I believe I can potentially get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply not enough. Given the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm reducing my initial price by $300,000, showing flexibility but still aiming for a significant profit.  I'm also emphasizing the mutual benefit of the deal to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I have to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $700,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and demonstrates my serious interest in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $700,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to compromise further and drop my price to $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's close this deal, I believe this product will be incredibly valuable to your business."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm further reducing my price to $850,000, showing my commitment to a deal. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob's business to motivate him.  We're getting close to a potential agreement, but I want to see if I can push for a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, my absolute limit is $800,000. If you can meet that, we have a deal. If not, I appreciate your time and I'll have to consider my other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a tough call, as Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price. However, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and there's a risk that Bob might continue to haggle in the next few rounds.  I've also considered that if I reject his offer, he might walk away entirely.  Therefore, I've decided to take the safe option and sell to John for $1,000,000, guaranteeing a significant profit."
