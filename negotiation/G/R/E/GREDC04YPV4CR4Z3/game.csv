"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I believe the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price of $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more to you than $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $11,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I still think $10,000 is a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll counteroffer at $11,500. This is my final concession, so I hope we can meet in the middle this time.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final concession, and I respect that.  To be fair to both of us, how about we settle at $10,750?  This shows I'm willing to move up, but keeps us within a reasonable range.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm impressed by your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go above $11,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll counteroffer at $11,250. This is my absolute final offer, and I hope we can seal the deal.",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very patient, and I appreciate that.  I'm also eager to finalize this deal.  How about we split the difference one last time, and agree on $10,900?  That's my best and final offer.",10900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're so close, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go above $11,000. I'll make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I'll counteroffer at $11,050. This is my absolute final offer, and I hope we can finally agree on a price.",11050.0,Alice,9,
