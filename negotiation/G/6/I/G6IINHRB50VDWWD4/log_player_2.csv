# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.
