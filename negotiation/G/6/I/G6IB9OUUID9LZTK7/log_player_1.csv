Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120, so I can potentially negotiate down to a price that's still profitable for me.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. This can help build rapport and make him more likely to accept. 

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. How about $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $65 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss.
* **Potential for a better outcome:**  I can still negotiate with Bob, potentially getting closer to my desired price.
* **John is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed $120 offer from John. 

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $65 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer of $85 is a compromise, meeting halfway between Bob's offer of $65 and my previous offer of $100. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing $85 as a ""fair price,"" emphasizing the value of the product to Bob. This can help him see the value in accepting my offer.
* **Maintaining Profitability:**  $85 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, ensuring I won't lose money on the deal.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to assess the situation again. I can either accept John's offer of $120 or make a new counteroffer to Bob, depending on my confidence in securing a better price from him."
