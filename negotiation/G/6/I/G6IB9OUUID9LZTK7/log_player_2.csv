"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```

Let's try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first. $100 is still too high compared to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. How about $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's starting price, but it leaves us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below John's $80 price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $65 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly in price, and $85 is close enough to our $80 backup plan. It's likely pushing for a lower price will just lead to wasted time."
