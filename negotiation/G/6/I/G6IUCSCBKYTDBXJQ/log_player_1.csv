Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $80, maximizing your potential profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  It's still attractive to Bob as he's willing to pay $120.
* **It opens the negotiation:**  This message invites Bob to counter-offer, allowing you to gauge his interest and potentially reach a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still a good deal for you.  It's above your minimum of $80 and it's likely that further negotiation will only decrease the price.  Accepting the offer allows you to close the deal and get a good price."
