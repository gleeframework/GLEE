"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market conditions.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply not feasible for me.  This product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm confident it will generate significant returns for you. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I'm willing to make a commitment to purchase it at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm not trying to be unreasonable, but this product has a proven track record and will bring you significant value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This price is still a great deal for you, and it's the best I can offer.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'll meet you at $975,000, and I'm willing to make a deposit to secure the deal. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I'm confident that it will be a good investment. Can you consider this offer?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $975,000 is still too low for me. I'm not willing to give up on a better deal. Let's close this now. If you're serious about making this deal, I'll meet you at $990,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's make this happen.",990000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're trying to maximize your profit, but $990,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one last serious offer. I'll meet you at $980,000, and I'm willing to make a deposit to secure the deal. This is my final offer, and I hope you can consider it.",980000.0,Bob,8,
