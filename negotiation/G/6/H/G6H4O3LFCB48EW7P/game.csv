Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.,1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm and the unique nature of the product, $1800000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford at this time.  I'm confident this is still a fair price considering the value you place on it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1600000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit high for me.  While I acknowledge the product's value, I'm sticking to my initial offer of $1200000. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still hesitant to meet me at $1600000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1500000. This is the final price I'm willing to accept, and I hope it's more in line with what you're willing to pay.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
