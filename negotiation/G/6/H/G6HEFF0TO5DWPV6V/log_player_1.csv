Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, but I won't go any higher.  Let me know if this is a starting point we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and providing your perspective. While your offer is significantly lower than our initial asking price, I understand there's room for negotiation.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects the true value and potential this product holds for your business."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still far too high.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. If you're not willing to meet me halfway, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at a price far below the product's value to me. It's unlikely he'll drastically increase his offer in the remaining rounds.  It's time to push him a bit more aggressively."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget you're working with, but I need to be upfront â€“ $850,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  This product has significant value that goes beyond its immediate price tag. To move forward, I need to see an offer closer to $1,800,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going above $900,000. This is a fair price given our previous discussions and my budget constraints. If you are unwilling to budge, I will need to look at other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has barely increased his offer, indicating he's unlikely to significantly move from his current position.  Waiting for him to potentially reach a more reasonable offer in the remaining rounds carries too much risk. Accepting John's offer guarantees I receive the product's full value to me."
