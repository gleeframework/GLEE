Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget you're working with, but I need to be upfront â€“ $850,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  This product has significant value that goes beyond its immediate price tag. To move forward, I need to see an offer closer to $1,800,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.
