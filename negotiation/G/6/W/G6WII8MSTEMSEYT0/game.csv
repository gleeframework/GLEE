"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $1,350,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle!",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,350,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,300,000. That's the highest I'm willing to pay. Can you consider that price?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
