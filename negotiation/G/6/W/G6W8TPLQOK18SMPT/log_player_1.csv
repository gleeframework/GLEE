Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) allows room for negotiation.
* **Not too High:** $175 is still below my minimum value of $150, so I can afford to make concessions if needed.
* **Friendly Tone:** Using a friendly tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I can still try to negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **John is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is just a little too low for me.  How about $140?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Focus on fairness:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair deal for both parties.
* **Maintain a friendly tone:** Continuing to be friendly encourages Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still hoping to keep the cost below $130. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:**  $130 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Even if I accept this offer, there's still a possibility that Bob might be willing to go a little higher in future interactions.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting his offer ensures a sale at a price that is close to my minimum."
