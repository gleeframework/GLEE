"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate. While I understand $65 is your current offer, I'm unable to go that low. My product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm confident it would be a great investment for you. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to continue working with you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $77.50 is still too low for me.  I'm confident this product can be extremely valuable to you, and I want to ensure we find a price that reflects that. Let's try $85. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to reach an agreement that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

We're getting close, but we can still try to get Alice down to $80."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $81.25 is still not quite right for me.  I've thought about it, and I'm willing to come down to $87.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it will be a great investment for you.  Let's close this deal and make it happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

Alice is unlikely to come down to $80, and we're running out of rounds. It's better to cut our losses and buy from John for the guaranteed price of $80."
