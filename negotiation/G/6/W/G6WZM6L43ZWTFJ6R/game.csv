"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer to get the ball rolling. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Would you consider $10,000? That feels like a fair starting point.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $14,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you be open to $11,000? That's a reasonable compromise, in my opinion.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can see that you're serious about making a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident that you'll find the product valuable enough to be worth it. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your bottom line, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $11,500?  It's a fair offer, and it gets us closer to a deal.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll meet you halfway between $11,500 and $13,000. I'll sell the product to you for $12,500. This is a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",12500.0,Alice,7,
