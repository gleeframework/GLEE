"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but this product is worth significantly more than that.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $900,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still giving you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $900,000, so how about $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
