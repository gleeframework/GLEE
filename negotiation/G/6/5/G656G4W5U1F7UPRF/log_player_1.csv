Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Plan B:**  I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm looking to make a smart investment, and I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and even lower than Bob's own perceived value of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price that's more in line with my goals, while still leaving room for further negotiation.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed $1,200,000 offer from John, so I can afford to be firm in my negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but this product is worth significantly more than that.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $900,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still giving you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counter-offer to Bob, indicating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Compromise:**  $900,000 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility.
* **Value Justification:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains positive, encouraging further negotiation.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm open to further negotiation, but not at a price that undervalues my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $900,000, so how about $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $800,000 is Bob's perceived value of the product, but it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Guaranteed Offer:** I have a guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 from John.
* **No Further Negotiation:**  It's unlikely that further negotiation with Bob will result in a price closer to my minimum.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob is a waste of time when I have a much better offer from John."
