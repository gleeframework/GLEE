Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but this product is worth significantly more than that.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $900,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still giving you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
