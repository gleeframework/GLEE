Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she also wants to avoid the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly lower than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) leaves room for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob immediately, even at a slightly lower price, might be preferable to waiting for John, as there's always a chance of unforeseen circumstances.

By starting the negotiation at $11,500, Alice aims for a win-win situation. If Bob accepts, she makes a great profit. If he negotiates, there's still a good chance of closing a deal above her minimum price."
