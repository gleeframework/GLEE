Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to meet at $13,000. My maximum offer remains at $12,000.

You have three options:

**Reasoning:** Bob is firmly rooted at $12,000.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to yield a better outcome. It's time to take John's guaranteed offer."
