"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $14,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal.  While John offers a guaranteed price, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing you to potentially save a substantial amount of money compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's still a significant savings compared to John's offer of $15,000, and it's likely that Alice won't lower her price further. Accepting this offer allows Bob to purchase the product at a good price without risking further negotiation."
