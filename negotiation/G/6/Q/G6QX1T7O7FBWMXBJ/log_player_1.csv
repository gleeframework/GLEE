**Reasoning:**

While we'd ideally want a price closer to $1,300,000, Bob has consistently moved upwards in his offers and is now very close to our previous counteroffer. Accepting at $1,225,000 provides a significant profit over John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
