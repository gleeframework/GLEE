"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I do see the value in the product, $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being open to negotiations. While I recognize the product's value,  $925,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $875,000, which is a fair compromise and represents a significant savings for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair deal given the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,5,
