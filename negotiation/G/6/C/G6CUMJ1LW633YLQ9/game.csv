,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's make this happen!",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. Can you consider that?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit below what I'm hoping to get. Let's split the difference at $13,250. I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you say?",13250.0,Alice,5,
