Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it at $150, there's a chance Bob will accept a slightly lower price, netting you more profit than selling to John.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with $140 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning a ""limited time"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
