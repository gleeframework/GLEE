"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. Since I know the product is worth at least $100 to me, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get more. I'll reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still holding out for a good profit.  I'm confident that Bob will be willing to pay a little more than $90."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  Although it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting his offers, he might walk away completely.  Selling to John for $100 is a safe option, but I think I can get slightly more from Bob."
