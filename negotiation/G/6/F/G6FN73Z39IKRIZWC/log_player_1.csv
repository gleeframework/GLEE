Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
