"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850000. Considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
