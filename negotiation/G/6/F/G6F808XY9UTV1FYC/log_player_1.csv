Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $150."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible. Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you can aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $150 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Potential for Higher Value:** While Bob values the product at $100, he might be willing to pay a premium if he believes it's worth more to him than alternative options."
