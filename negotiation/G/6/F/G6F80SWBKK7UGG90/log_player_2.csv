"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to your offer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to go down to $105, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go down to $100.  It's better to take the guaranteed deal from John and save the most money."
