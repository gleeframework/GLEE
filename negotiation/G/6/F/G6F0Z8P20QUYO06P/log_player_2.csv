"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140. It's a great deal and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
``` 
Reason:While $140 is close to my limit, I want to see if Alice is willing to go lower. There's still room for negotiation.
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $140 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reason:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still a reasonable profit margin for her. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge her willingness to lower the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $110 is lower than my initial price, I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

```
Reason: Alice is moving in the right direction, but $125 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay. I'll try to negotiate a bit further before considering John's offer.
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $117?"",
""product_price"": 117
}
```

**Reason:**  I'm splitting the difference between her last offer ($125) and my previous counteroffer ($110).  This shows I'm willing to negotiate and move closer to her price, but I'm still aiming for a good deal."
