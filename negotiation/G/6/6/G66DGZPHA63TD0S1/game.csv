"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  It's a great product with a lot of value.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
