"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good starting point in the negotiation. I know the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, so I'm leaving some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get as close to my target price as possible in the first few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum target of $800,000.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price with continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 880000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $880,000.  This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum target.  I hope this encourages Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $860,000 is getting closer to my minimum target, I'm still hoping to squeeze a bit more out of this negotiation.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 870000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $870,000. This is a smaller compromise, but I believe it's enough to show Bob I'm serious about getting a deal done while still securing a price closer to my ideal target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $865,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $865,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a bit more, $865,000 is a good compromise and above my minimum target. With only 4 rounds left, I'm taking the deal to avoid the risk of losing out completely."
