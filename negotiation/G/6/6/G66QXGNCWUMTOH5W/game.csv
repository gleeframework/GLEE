"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1200000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. However, $950000 is still significantly below the value I see in this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it offers a strong value proposition for you. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
