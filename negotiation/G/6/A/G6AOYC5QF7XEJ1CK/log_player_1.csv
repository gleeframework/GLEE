This offer starts the negotiation by aiming for a price slightly below the maximum Bob is willing to pay. It leaves room for negotiation, but also allows you to secure a good profit without relying on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to get closer to my target price of $1,150,000 in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,125,000?  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1125000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good deal. How about we try $1075000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject it and try to counteroffer again. While John's offer is tempting, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you. But $1,075,000 is simply too low for me. To show my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not ready to meet you at $1100000. I'm willing to go up to $1075000, but I need you to meet me at that price. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price.

Bob is unwilling to budge, and I'm not willing to go lower than $1,100,000.  It's time to cut my losses and accept John's offer.  While it's not my ideal outcome, it's still a good deal, and it ensures I don't risk losing out on any profit."
