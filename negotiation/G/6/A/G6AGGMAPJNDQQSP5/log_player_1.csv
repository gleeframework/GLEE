Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $120. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $120 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  It's also significantly higher than his perceived value, but not so high that it's insulting.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $150 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you're still guaranteed a good price.
* **Maximizing Profit:** The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. This offer attempts to strike a balance between potentially securing a deal with Bob while keeping the price significantly above his perceived value."
