Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product today for $12,000. I know it's valuable to you and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, I can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Potential for higher profit:**  A significant markup allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a price higher than my fallback option.
* **Confident presentation:** Framing the offer with confidence can make Bob more receptive to the higher price. 

This strategy balances risk and potential reward. If Bob accepts, I secure a significant profit. If he rejects, I can still sell to John at my minimum acceptable price."
