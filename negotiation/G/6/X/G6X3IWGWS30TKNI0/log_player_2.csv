# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, which is a slight concession from my previous offer. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is only $25,000 higher than your last counteroffer.  Considering you have limited rounds remaining, and buying from John would cost $1,500,000, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous option. It saves you $425,000 compared to buying from John, and you've successfully negotiated a significant discount from Alice's initial price."
