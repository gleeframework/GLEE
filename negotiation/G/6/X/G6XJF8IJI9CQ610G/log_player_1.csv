"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** While $1,750,000 is above Bob's perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, allowing for potential compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone and highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $1750000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product but can only go up to $850000 at this time.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $850,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and significantly lower than my initial offer.
* **Potential for negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate, as Bob has shown interest and acknowledged the product's value. 
* **Selling to John is an option:** While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I have a backup option in John, who is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price. This gives me leverage. 

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer that is more aligned with my expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $850,000 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to come down to $1,250,000.  This is still a significant value for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but not too much:** I'm lowering my price from the initial $1,750,000, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, I'm staying well above Bob's offer and still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that even at $1,250,000, he's getting a good deal.
* **Setting a deadline:** I'm creating a sense of urgency by suggesting that this is my final offer, encouraging Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1250000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but that's my absolute maximum. If you're not able to come down to that, I may need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Bob's final offer?** Bob is suggesting this is his ""absolute maximum"", which might signal he's close to his limit.
* **Leveraging John:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is still a very attractive option.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate, especially if I can convince Bob of the product's true value.

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for a compromise. This will test Bob's commitment and push him toward a deal closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $950,000 is a considerable amount, and I acknowledge your efforts to find a price that works for you. However, I'm still committed to getting a fair price for my product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, to $1,100,000. This is a significant offer, and it shows my dedication to reaching an agreement.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.  I'm open to hearing any additional thoughts you may have."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm lowering my price slightly from $1,250,000 to $1,100,000, demonstrating flexibility. 
* **Focus on the Gap:** I'm highlighting the gap between our offers to encourage Bob to consider meeting me halfway.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm still above my minimum acceptable price and have the option of selling to John.
* **Positive and Open Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and open tone, emphasizing my willingness to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, but I can't go any higher. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you as well.  I hope you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still $500,000 lower. This means selling to John is still a more financially favorable option at this point.
* **Bob's Final Offer:**  Bob is suggesting this is his final offer, but there is a chance for negotiation. It's possible he might be willing to go higher if he truly wants the product.
* **Leveraging Time:**  I have several rounds remaining, and I can use this time to try and push Bob closer to my desired price.

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that is still above my minimum but closer to his offer. This might encourage him to reconsider and potentially increase his offer, ultimately leading to a better deal for me."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,000,000 is a good offer, it's still slightly below what I need to make this deal work. To bridge the gap, I'm prepared to come down to $1,200,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a fair agreement. I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us. Please let me know if you're open to this offer. I'm eager to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm lowering my offer slightly from $1,250,000 to $1,200,000, showing flexibility and a commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Highlighting the Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of its worth and positioning $1,200,000 as a fair price for both parties.
* **Creating Urgency:** I'm expressing my eagerness to finalize the deal, hinting at the possibility of walking away if an agreement isn't reached soon.
* **Leveraging John:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I haven't revealed my John option yet. This provides me with a hidden leverage point.

This counteroffer should encourage Bob to reconsider his position and possibly increase his offer again.  The smaller gap might make the deal more attractive to him, and the urgency might motivate him to act quickly."
