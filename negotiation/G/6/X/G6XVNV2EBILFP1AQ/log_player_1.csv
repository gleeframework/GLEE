Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $140. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** While the product is worth $150 to you (and you have a guaranteed buyer at that price), starting at $150 with Bob leaves no room for negotiation.  A slightly lower offer of $140 makes it seem like a deal while still securing a significant profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  If Bob counters, you can potentially meet in the middle, still getting more than the $80 value it holds for him.
* **Considering the Alternative:** You'll make more profit if Bob accepts this offer than if you sell it to John for your minimum acceptable price."
