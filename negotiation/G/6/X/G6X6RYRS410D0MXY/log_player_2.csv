```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I'm not ready to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you at $105. I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my price point, $105 is still above my maximum budget of $80.  At this point, I'm confident that I won't be able to get her lower than $100. Rather than continuing to negotiate and risk running out of rounds, I'll purchase the product from John for $80. This ensures I get the product at a price within my budget."
