"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $140 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $140 was a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal at this point.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I'm not ready to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you at $105. I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
