"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable asset. I believe it's worth considering a price of $900000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** Bob is offering a significant discount from Alice's initial price, showing he's serious about getting a deal.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  $750,000 is still above Alice's value, creating space for a compromise. 
* **Sets the tone:** This counteroffer establishes Bob as a willing buyer but also someone who won't overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of a price of $850000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** Alice's offer of $850,000 is a significant drop from her initial offer and is a reasonable compromise.
* **Saving money:**  Buying at this price saves Bob $150,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Risk of going lower:** Continuing to negotiate could result in Alice walking away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.

Accepting the offer secures a good deal without risking losing the opportunity altogether."
