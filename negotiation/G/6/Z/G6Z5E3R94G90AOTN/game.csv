"Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a valuable product that's worth at least $1500000 to me. I'm willing to start at $2000000. This is a significant opportunity for you, and I believe it holds great potential. Let's discuss.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the product with you, Alice. However, $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1400000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned it holds to you.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1400000 is significantly below my minimum. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1700000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's true value and allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, Alice. However, $1700000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1650000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned it holds to you.",1650000.0,Bob,4,
