"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you can meet me halfway.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This price allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a significant discount. Let me know if this works for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,800? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,800 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,150? This is a fair compromise that allows me to move forward while still giving you a good deal.  I really want to work with you on this, so let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10150.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget of $8,000. Would you be willing to go down to $9,000? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a final offer.",9000.0,Bob,6,
