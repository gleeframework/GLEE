Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100.  This gives Bob a decent margin to potentially negotiate, but it's also well above my minimum acceptable price. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$75 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. This is still a good price for Bob, but it's also closer to my initial price and closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is above my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it's also higher than what John is offering.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer to maximize my profit."
