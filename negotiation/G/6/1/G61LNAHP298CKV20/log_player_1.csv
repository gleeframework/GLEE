Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that's higher than Bob's valuation but lower than my minimum. It gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encouraging. It frames the offer as a good deal for both parties. 

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  The initial offer is close to my minimum, allowing me to potentially get a better price if Bob is willing to negotiate.
* **Avoid unnecessary delays:** By offering a price that's relatively close to Bob's valuation, I hope to avoid lengthy negotiations that could lead to a rejection or a lower offer. 
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:**  Having a backup buyer like John allows me to walk away from negotiations if Bob is unwilling to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't settle for a price that drastically undervalues my product. 

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiate further:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate but I'm not desperate. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  Knowing I can sell to John for a much higher price gives me a strong position in negotiations. 
* **Potentially increase the offer:**  I'm open to a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum. However, if Bob's counteroffer is still too low, I'll either propose a new offer or simply sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000:** This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but still below my minimum, showing flexibility. 
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and tries to make the counteroffer sound appealing by highlighting the discount from the original price.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain leverage:**  The counteroffer is still above Bob's valuation, so I'm not giving away too much.
* **Increase the likelihood of a deal:**  The price is more appealing than the previous offer but still allows room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Stay open to negotiation:**  The message suggests that I'm willing to find a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob. I've already made concessions and it seems Bob isn't budging significantly further.  I'm confident I can sell to John for a much better price, and I don't want to risk losing out on that opportunity by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize profit:** Selling to John ensures the highest possible return.
* **Avoid further negotiation:**  The risk of further negotiation with Bob could lead to a lower price or a prolonged process, potentially affecting the timeliness of the sale.
* **Secure the deal:** By selling to John, I guarantee a successful sale and avoid any potential delays or complications."
