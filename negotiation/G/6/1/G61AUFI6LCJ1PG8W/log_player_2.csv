"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have an amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Since Alice's offer is exactly the same price as buying from John, it's the same outcome for Bob.  Accepting Alice's offer doesn't lose Bob any money and might allow for the possibility of negotiating a lower price in the future."
