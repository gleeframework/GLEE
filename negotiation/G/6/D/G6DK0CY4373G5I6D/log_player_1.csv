""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,190,000.  Let me know your decision soon."",

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below your guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and potential bargain for Bob. It allows for a profit above your minimum while staying competitive.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is direct, highlights the product's value, and encourages a prompt response."
