"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start at $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. Can you consider it?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would ensure both of us get a fair deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. Can you consider it?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $950,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum. It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your minimum price, but I'm still trying to save some money. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $980,000. Can you consider it?",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to be able to agree on a price.  I'm going to stick to my minimum price of $1,000,000. If you're serious about purchasing this product, I'm willing to close the deal at this price. However, if you're not, I'm going to have to move on to other potential buyers.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
