# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and I believe it presents a great opportunity for you.  While I have another buyer willing to pay full price, I value your potential as a long-term partner and would prefer to work with you if possible.  Please let me know your decision.
