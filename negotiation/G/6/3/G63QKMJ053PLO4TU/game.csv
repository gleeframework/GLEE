"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This price still reflects the value I believe the product holds, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to increase my offer to $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I believe the product holds, and I'm hoping we can finalize the sale at this point. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is close, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we settle at $925,000? This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal here.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting very close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking more along the lines of $975,000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to finalize the sale. What are your thoughts?",975000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're definitely in the ballpark now.  I'm willing to split the difference to get this deal done.  How about $950,000? That's my final offer.",950000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $950,000. I'm willing to make one final offer: $980,000. This is as close to my target as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. What are your thoughts?",980000.0,Alice,9,
