"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always good to start by seeing if you can get a better price. $900,000 is a good starting point, but it's worth exploring if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This will test her willingness to negotiate and give us room to bargain in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $800,000 is closer to my target, I'm still aiming to get a lower price.  I'll try another counteroffer to see if I can push her further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $750,000. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product but still pushing for a good deal.  Hopefully, it's a price Alice will be willing to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $820,000 is a good price, considering I'm aiming for a price under $1,500,000.  While I might be able to squeeze out a bit more, I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation, and it's important to balance the potential for a lower price against the risk of losing the deal.  Accepting at $820,000 is a smart choice given the circumstances."
