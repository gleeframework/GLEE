"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a product that's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I believe this price is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below the product's value to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm still looking to get as close to my target price as possible. With that in mind, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value of the product to both of us.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price again."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of going back and forth without reaching a mutually agreeable price.  At this point, it's more efficient for Bob to buy the product from John, who is offering the product at Bob's maximum budget."
