"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value ($100). This is to leave room for potential negotiation and because I want to maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $100. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering a price of $95.  It's a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it's attractive enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to come up a little more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $90.  This shows flexibility and hopefully encourages Bob to accept.  I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum value but I'm starting to feel the pressure of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, I'm not confident I can get Bob to come up to my minimum value.  Selling to John for $100 is the best option to guarantee my desired profit."
