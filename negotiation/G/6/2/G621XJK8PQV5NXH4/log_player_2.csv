"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's in great condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is asking $115.  There's room to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. How about $110? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
