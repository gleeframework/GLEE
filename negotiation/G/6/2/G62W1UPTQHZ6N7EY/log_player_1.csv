"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a substantial profit.  This price will likely be rejected, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation. I'm also confident that the product's true value to Bob could be higher than $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent profit, I believe I can still push for a better price. I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offering. This will demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while also showing that I value the product highly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining a strong position. I believe this counteroffer is a good balance between achieving a high price and potentially closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $1,250,000 is a good price, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still confident in the product's value.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, we're getting close to my initial asking price and we're running out of rounds.  It's a good deal, and it's better than selling to John for $1,000,000."
