"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true value and growth potential.  What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,300,000 is far outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my financial constraints. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it, which is the maximum I can spend.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is significantly below its market value and the return on investment you'll see.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a fair offer considering the product's potential to transform your operations.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. Let's try $1,200,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial limits.  I'm confident this deal can be mutually beneficial.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the immense value this product offers.  While $1,200,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant discount.  Let's settle at $1,800,000.  This reflects my bottom line and ensures a win-win scenario for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're determined to get the best price, but $1,800,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm genuinely interested in the product, and I believe $1,400,000 is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  This offer reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my budget. Let's try to find a compromise.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
