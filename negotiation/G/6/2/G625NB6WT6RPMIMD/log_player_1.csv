Given its unique features and potential for your business, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,300,000 is far outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my financial constraints. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it, which is the maximum I can spend.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is significantly below its market value and the return on investment you'll see.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a fair offer considering the product's potential to transform your operations."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. Let's try $1,200,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial limits.  I'm confident this deal can be mutually beneficial. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

``` 

Even though Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still willing to negotiate further. There's a chance I can get a better deal from Bob before having to settle for John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the immense value this product offers.  While $1,200,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant discount.  Let's settle at $1,800,000.  This reflects my bottom line and ensures a win-win scenario for both of us."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're determined to get the best price, but $1,800,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm genuinely interested in the product, and I believe $1,400,000 is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  This offer reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my budget. Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
