Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is significantly below its market value and the return on investment you'll see.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly recognizing the immense value this product offers.  While $1,200,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant discount.  Let's settle at $1,800,000.  This reflects my bottom line and ensures a win-win scenario for both of us.
