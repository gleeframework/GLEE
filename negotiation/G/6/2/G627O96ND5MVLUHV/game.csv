"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more than my asking price.  I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm. While I see the value in this product,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'd like to propose a price of $850,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us and would allow me to proceed with the purchase.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $850,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $900,000? This reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me, considering my budget.  Let's try $875,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my price range.  I'm confident we can reach a deal that benefits both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be well worth the investment. Let's settle this now. I'm willing to come down to $885,000.  This is my final offer.",885000.0,Alice,5,
