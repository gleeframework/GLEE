,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It seems we both recognize the value of this product. However, $1,800,000 is still significantly below its true worth. I could consider a price of $2,100,000.  This takes into account its unique features and the long-term benefits it offers.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I still think $2,100,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Your willingness to find a mutually agreeable price is clear.  To bridge the gap, I'm prepared to come down to $2,050,000.  I believe this offer represents a fair compromise, recognizing the true value of this product.",2050000.0,Alice,5,
