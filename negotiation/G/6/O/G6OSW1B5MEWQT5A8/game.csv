"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my research and the product's market value, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects the true potential of the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the product's value. However, $1,000,000 falls significantly short of what I consider fair.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This reflects the true worth of this unique product and its potential. Let me know what you think.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,800,000 remains outside my comfortable range. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring the product, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in it.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I acknowledge your commitment to finding a solution. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to lower my offer to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept. It's a fantastic opportunity to acquire a product of this caliber at this price.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
