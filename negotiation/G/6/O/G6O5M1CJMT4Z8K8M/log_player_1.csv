"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm confident this is a great opportunity for you, but I'm also open to discussing a fair counteroffer if needed."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($1,000,000) and to Bob ($800,000). This allows room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** My message highlights the value of the product and emphasizes the opportunity for Bob.
* **Openness:** I acknowledge the possibility of counteroffers and show willingness to negotiate.
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  This price is still significantly higher than what John would pay, giving me some flexibility to negotiate without needing to immediately turn to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above My Minimum:**  While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob. He's shown interest and acknowledged the product's value. 
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John at this point would be a safe move, but I want to see if I can achieve a better outcome with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counter with a price closer to my goal, but still acknowledging Bob's budget constraints."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While I believe the product is worth more, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,050,000? This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my minimum.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above My Minimum:**  $1,050,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't sell below what I'm comfortable with.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reemphasize the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the opportunity.
* **Finding a Solution:** I use language that suggests a collaborative approach, fostering a sense of partnership in reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $850,000? I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below My Minimum:** $850,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:** While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, it seems unlikely he'll go much higher. 
* **Avoiding a Loss:**  Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me.
* **John is a Safe Option:** While John doesn't offer the best price, he's a reliable buyer, and selling to him would prevent a loss. However, I want to see if I can push Bob a little further first.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer closer to $1,000,000, but I'll need to be prepared to consider selling to John if Bob doesn't budge much."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $950,000. This price is a fair compromise, and it allows me to continue negotiating with you.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing a genuine willingness to compromise. 
* **Still Above My Minimum:** $950,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't sell at a loss. 
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I emphasize that this price is a ""fair compromise"" and a ""mutually beneficial solution,"" appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and collaboration.
* **Pressure on Bob:** I'm using this offer to pressure Bob to consider increasing his offer further. I'm showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly below the product's value. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:** I'm still keeping John as a backup option. If Bob rejects this offer again, I'll likely consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you believe the product is worth more, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to consider $825,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Far Below My Minimum:** $825,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Limited Negotiation Potential:**  Bob's offers have been consistently below my desired price range, and it seems unlikely he'll be willing to increase his offer significantly.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only a few rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a better price with Bob.
* **Avoiding a Loss:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, preventing a potential loss.

**Conclusion:**

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, I'm choosing to sell to John to avoid losing too much money. This decision is based on the current negotiation dynamics, the time constraints, and my desire to secure a fair deal."
