"Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While I believe the product is worth more, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,050,000? This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my minimum.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $950,000. This price is a fair compromise, and it allows me to continue negotiating with you.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",950000.0,Alice,5,
