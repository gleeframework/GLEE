"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to come down that far.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,300,000?  This would still give you a great deal and leave room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
