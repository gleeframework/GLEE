Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is a decent price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point with further negotiation.  I still have 9 rounds to reach an agreement."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to come down that far.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,300,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with it.  We've got 6 rounds left, so I have time to see if I can get a better deal."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000 is too high, so I'll try to meet you in the middle from my previous offer. How about $1,175,000?

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We're down to the last two rounds and I'm concerned that if I reject his offer again, he might walk away, and I might end up having to sell to John at a much lower price.  $1,200,000 is still a good deal for me, and I'm confident that I can still make a profit."
