"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially gain a better price. I'm also framing the message in a way that emphasizes the value of the product and creates a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting but $15000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob or John. I will counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. "", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility but still maintaining a price that's closer to my minimum. I'm also reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still sticking to my budget of $8000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for this product.  If you're willing to consider it, we can finalize the deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to look elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is being stubborn and sticking to his $8,000 offer. This is below my minimum and I'm running out of time. It's better to secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John than risk further negotiations with Bob."
