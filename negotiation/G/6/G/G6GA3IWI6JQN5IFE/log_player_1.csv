"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's necessary to gauge Bob's interest and potentially push him to offer a higher counter-price. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm happy with $1,500,000, Bob's initial offer is too low. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,800,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintains a profit margin above my minimum. Hopefully, this will entice Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I want to see if I can get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,700,000.  This is a small step down from my previous offer, but I'm hoping it will be enough to convince Bob to come closer to my desired price. I'm running out of rounds, but I'm not ready to settle for $1,600,000 yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a bit more, $1,650,000 is a good price, especially considering we only have a few rounds left. There's a risk that if I reject, Bob might walk away or offer a lower price in the next round. I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
