"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,000.  This still gives you a great value, and it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $12,500.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,
