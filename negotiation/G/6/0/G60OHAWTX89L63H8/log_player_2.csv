"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than the initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation and helps gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Respectful but Firm:** The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer, but it also clearly states that the initial price is unacceptable.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $1,000,000, Bob positions himself well below his maximum budget ($1,500,000) and significantly below Alice's starting price, encouraging her to move closer to his desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers you significant value, which I'm sure you recognize.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice moved closer to Bob's desired price range, $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than her own valuation of the product ($800,000).  There's likely room for further negotiation.
* **Avoiding a Rushed Decision:** Accepting immediately might make Alice think Bob is willing to go even higher. Rejecting encourages her to make further concessions. 
* **John's Price as Leverage:**  Bob always has the option to buy from John for $1,500,000. This provides a price ceiling and reduces pressure to accept an unfavorable deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $1,200,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  How about we settle at $1,100,000?  I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:** Bob is moving closer to Alice's price, but in smaller increments ($100,000) to signal that he's not willing to simply meet in the middle.
* **Seeking Compromise:**  The message frames the offer as a fair compromise, appealing to a sense of mutual agreement.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $1,100,000 keeps Bob well below his maximum budget and maintains pressure on Alice to move closer to his desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to get $1,150,000 for this.  It's a final offer on my end - I believe it represents a great deal for you given its potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Alice stating this is her final offer adds weight to her position and signals she's unlikely to move much lower.
* **Reasonable Price:** $1,150,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's a significant saving compared to John's price ($1,500,000) and still allows Alice to make a good profit. 
* **Risk of Pushing Too Far:**  If Bob rejects this offer and counteroffers, he risks Alice backing out entirely or becoming less willing to negotiate. It's better to secure a good deal now."
