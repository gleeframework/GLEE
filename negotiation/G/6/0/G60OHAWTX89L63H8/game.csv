"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers you significant value, which I'm sure you recognize.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $1,200,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  How about we settle at $1,100,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to get $1,150,000 for this.  It's a final offer on my end - I believe it represents a great deal for you given its potential.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
