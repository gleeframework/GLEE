{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob.  
* **Testing the Waters:**  A price of $1,500,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves space for potential negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit beyond your minimum. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's financial limitations. If you had more information, you might adjust your approach.
* Time is also a factor. If you need to sell quickly, you might lower the price to ensure a faster deal with Bob."
