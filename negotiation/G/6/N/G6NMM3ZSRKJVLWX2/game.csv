"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its value.  How about meeting halfway at $1,400,000? This is a fair offer considering the immense potential this product holds for your business.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I could go up to $700,000. ",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I believe this is my final offer, and I hope we can close the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
