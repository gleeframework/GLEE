**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is $300,000 less than John's price. 
* **Even though Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to her ($800,000), it's still a good deal for you.** You are getting the product for a price significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000."
