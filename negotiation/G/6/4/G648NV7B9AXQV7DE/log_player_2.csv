Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, however, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you finding middle ground. I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. To make this work, I'm willing to accept $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice has made it clear she won't go below $1,200,000. While the product might be worth more to you than John's price, going any further with Alice is unlikely to yield a result better than what John offers.  You maximize your savings by taking John's deal."
