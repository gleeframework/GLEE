"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a strong opening offer above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Confident Tone:**  I want to convey that I believe in the product's value and that this is a serious offer.
* **Open to Discussion:** I end by encouraging Bob's feedback, signaling that I'm open to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum price and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss for me.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal. I'll counter in the next round, aiming to bring the price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, however, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Counteroffer:** I start by acknowledging Bob's offer to show I'm engaging in the negotiation.
* **Firm but Fair:**  While I'm coming down in price, I'm doing so in a measured way to signal I'm not desperate. My counteroffer is still significantly above his initial offer and closer to my desired range.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price and encourage Bob to meet me closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However,  $1,300,000 is still outside of my budget. I could meet you halfway from our previous offers. Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now negotiating more seriously, moving closer to his perceived value. However, $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll continue negotiating, but I'm also getting closer to the point where selling to John might be the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you finding middle ground. I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. To make this work, I'm willing to accept $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm stating clearly that this is my final offer to convey urgency and seriousness.  
* **Meeting My Minimum:**  I'm coming down to my absolute minimum acceptable price. This ensures I don't make a loss.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating that this price is a significant compromise on my part to encourage Bob to accept. 

Now, the ball is in Bob's court. I've made it clear what I need, and he can decide if the product is worth it to him at this price. If he rejects this, I will sell to John in the next round."
