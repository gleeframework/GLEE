"Alice, that's a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm thinking something closer to $7,000 would be fair.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a fair deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,750 and call it a deal?",7750.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to the point where I'd rather sell to John, but I'm still willing to work with you. I can do $8,250, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",8250.0,Alice,5,
