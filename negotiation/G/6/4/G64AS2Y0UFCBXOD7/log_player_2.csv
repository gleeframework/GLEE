"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get it for $10,000 from John, and the product is only worth $8,000 to Alice. There's room for negotiation here."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $8,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still not in a range I'm thrilled about. It's worth another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,750 and call it a deal?"",
""product_price"": 7750
}
``` 

We're splitting the difference again to show we're willing to negotiate, but aiming closer to a price I'm comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to the point where I'd rather sell to John, but I'm still willing to work with you. I can do $8,250, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling this is her final offer. While we could try to haggle a tiny bit more,  $8,250 is a reasonable price and a good deal compared to John's $10,000 offer. It's time to take the deal."
