"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount for Bob, but still gives me a decent profit. I'm also setting a positive tone, emphasizing the value of the product for him. I'm confident Bob will counteroffer, and we can go from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to pay closer to $11000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a higher price in the next round. There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $12,000. It's still a good deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for $12000.  Let's split the difference. How about $11500?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is good.  It's above my minimum threshold of $10,000, and it's still a decent profit for me.  Accepting his offer is a good decision, as there's always a risk of continuing the negotiation and ending up with a lower price or even having to sell to John."
