Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand it's a bit higher than your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. What do you think?

Alice is coming down, but slowly. We're still aiming for a much lower price. Let's see if we can encourage her to move closer to $10,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me partway.  To be honest, $10,000 is the highest I can go.  It's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $10,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer it to you for $10,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll see the value in it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

This is a good deal.  We're saving a significant amount compared to John's price, and Alice is unlikely to go much lower.  It's time to accept and close the deal."
