"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You should reject Alice's offer.  You're looking for a price of $80 or less, and $100 is too high.  You can do better!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested but I'm really looking to spend closer to $80.  Would you be willing to consider $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $92 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While $92 is lower than her initial offer, you're still aiming for $80 or less. You can likely negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target price.  How about $88?  I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your target price, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $95 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really like it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is clearly not willing to go lower than $95. You have a solid alternative with John, who is selling the product for $80.  It's time to take the sure thing and buy from John."
