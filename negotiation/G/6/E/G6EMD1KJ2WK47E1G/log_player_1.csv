Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, showing Bob you're willing to negotiate, but it also leaves room for bargaining.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, I can potentially close the gap even further and maximize my profits."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

I'm adjusting my price down slightly to acknowledge Bob's counteroffer, but I'm still aiming for a deal that's closer to my initial asking price.  This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise while still trying to secure a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now the same as his previous counteroffer, and while it's a bit lower than my initial goal, it's still a good deal.  It's time to secure the sale and move on."
