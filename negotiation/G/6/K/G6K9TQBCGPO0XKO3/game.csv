"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1500000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something we can work with?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. My counteroffer is $1350000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1100000. Can we discuss further?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1100000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. My next counteroffer is $1250000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What are your thoughts?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I still think $1250000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1100000 and $1250000, so I'm offering $1175000. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept?",1175000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1175000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My next counteroffer is $1300000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I still think $1300000 is too high. I'm willing to offer $1150000, which is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can we finalize the deal at this price?",1150000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1150000. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My next counteroffer is $1200000. I believe this is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Alice,9,

"I understand that you're making one last concession, but I'm still not willing to pay $1200000. I'm willing to meet you at $1150000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to explore other options, including buying from John for $1500000.",1150000.0,Bob,10,
