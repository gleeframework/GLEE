Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and high demand, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and that John provides a guaranteed fallback at that price. This allows Alice to aim significantly higher with Bob.
* **Strategic Starting Point:** A price of $1,200,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while still aiming for a substantial profit above Alice's minimum.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value and desirability, aiming to justify the high price in Bob's mind.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Research:**  This strategy assumes Alice has a good understanding of the market and potential buyer behavior. If similar products rarely sell above $1,000,000, this offer might backfire.
* **Negotiation Skills:** Alice needs to be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a clear idea of her lowest acceptable price is crucial.
* **Relationship Building:** While aiming for profit, Alice should be mindful of not appearing overly aggressive. Maintaining a positive tone can help facilitate a deal."
