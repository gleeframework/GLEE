"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $12,500? This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would that work for you?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  I believe this price is fair for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I can do $11,200, and I think that's a fair compromise. What do you say?",11200.0,Bob,6,
