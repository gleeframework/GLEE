Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price even higher than John's offer.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's ""value"" and ""worth,"" you subtly reinforce to Bob that it's worth a significant sum. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  Phrases like ""initially proposing"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signal that you're open to hearing Bob's perspective and potentially negotiating.

**Important Note:**  While John provides a safety net, aiming higher with Bob could lead to a more profitable outcome."
