You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $675,000, which is within Bob's budget and a significant saving compared to John's price. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject his counteroffer and he might end up paying John's full price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking a worse outcome."
