"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. This is a good starting point because it's a bit higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob will be willing to negotiate as he values the product higher than my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the $980,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate.  I'm not willing to settle for such a low offer yet.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my original offer, but still above Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm offering $1,100,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from my previous offer.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him, but still gives me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'm confident I can push him a little further.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as Bob's offer is approaching my target.  I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my last offer, but still higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1080000}
```

I'm offering $1,080,000. This is a slight reduction from my previous offer, but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate while bringing us closer to a deal.  I believe this will be a good compromise for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,040,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,040,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, but it's still not quite there. We're nearing the halfway point in our negotiations, and I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, aiming to get closer to a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1060000}
```

I'm offering $1,060,000. This is a compromise, but still above Bob's last offer.  We're getting close to a deal, and I'm hoping this offer will be acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to my desired price.  With only a few rounds left, I'm not confident I can push for a higher price and risk losing the deal.  Selling to John would also be a good outcome, but I'm happy with this price and want to secure the sale with Bob."
