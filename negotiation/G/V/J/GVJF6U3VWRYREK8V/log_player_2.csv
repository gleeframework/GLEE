# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it holds significant value for you as well. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer ready to purchase it at $1,000,000 if you decline.
