Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also reflects the fact that the product is worth $150 to Bob, so he has incentive to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $100. While it's higher than John's offer of $80, it's still lower than my desired price. I believe I can get closer to my target by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counter-offering at $110. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $100.  It still leaves some room for negotiation but shows I'm willing to be flexible."
