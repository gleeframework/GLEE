"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer of $120.  While it's better than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice, potentially saving even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $100 for the product. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and still leaves room for Alice to make a profit ($100 - $80 = $20). This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's desire to negotiate a fair price while still being within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $110 is within Bob's budget and is a better deal than buying from John for $150. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal and the risk of Alice walking away is higher. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product for a reasonable price."
