"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $10,800 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal work.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I'm not comfortable going any lower than $11,000.  It's a fair price considering the value I'm offering.  Let's find a compromise here, or I might have to look at other options.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $10,800, but I really need to be at $10,500 or lower. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,6,
