Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with my ideal price, knowing it's more than Bob's perceived value. This sets a strong starting point and leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or continue negotiating. If the negotiations stall, I have the fallback option of selling to John for my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, and I'm not willing to accept such a substantial loss.  I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a compromise that satisfies both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer to $1,100,000. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a substantial profit margin.  I'm hoping this counteroffer is attractive enough for Bob to consider, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still too low for me to accept. While I'm open to negotiation, it seems we're too far apart on price.  To ensure I get the value I need, I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,200,000."
