"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for $1000000. I know this is a valuable asset for you, and I'm confident you'll see the potential it holds. This is a one-time chance to secure something that aligns perfectly with your needs.  Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer waiting in the wings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at the maximum price you're willing to pay. You can get the same product from John for the same price. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the most sensible choice, as it doesn't affect your budget or the quality of the product."
