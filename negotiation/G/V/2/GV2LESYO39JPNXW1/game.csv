"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd be willing to pay $14000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me is $12000.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $14000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $16000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds to me. I believe this is a good middle ground for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your understanding, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd need to pay $13500 for the product. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, considering its value to me is $12000.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that $13500 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16000 and $13500. I'm thinking of a price of $14750. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good opportunity for us to come to an agreement.",14750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $14750. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14750 and $13500, which would be $14125. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $12000.",14125.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $14000. Considering the value it holds to me, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $14250.

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $13500. I've already made several concessions, and I believe this is the maximum price I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $12000.",13500.0,Bob,10,
