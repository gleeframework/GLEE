"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $15,000. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to sell for $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit.  He should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $13,500? This is as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

At this point, Bob should buy the product from John.  He's already rejected a price of $12,000, and Alice has made it clear that she won't go lower than $13,500. This is still above Bob's budget. Buying from John for $8,000 is the best option to ensure he gets the product at a price within his range."
