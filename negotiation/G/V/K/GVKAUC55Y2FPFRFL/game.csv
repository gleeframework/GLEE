"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start at a price of $18,000. This is a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"While I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is outside my budget. I'm very interested in this product and would be willing to pay $10,000.  This price is fair and allows for a good profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $14,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down to $14,000, but that's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $12,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find another buyer at this price.  Let's close this deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. This is a fair price that should work for both of us. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
