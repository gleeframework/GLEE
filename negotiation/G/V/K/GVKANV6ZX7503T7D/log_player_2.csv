"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
This is a great starting offer from Alice, but there's room for negotiation.  We should counter-offer with a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $750,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you.

Alice is negotiating towards a fair price, but we're not there yet. Let's try another counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider $810,000?"", ""product_price"": 810000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the price closer to $800,000, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm now offering the product to you for $820,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000.

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and $820,000 is a great price, saving $380,000 off John's price. It's unlikely further haggling will yield significantly better results, and we risk pushing Alice away."
