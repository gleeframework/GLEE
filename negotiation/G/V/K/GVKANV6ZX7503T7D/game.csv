"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  That product looks great, but $900,000 is a little high for my budget. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $750,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider $810,000?",810000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the price closer to $800,000, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm now offering the product to you for $820,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",820000.0,Alice,5,
