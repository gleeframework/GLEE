"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe you'd find very valuable. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit too high for me right now. I'm thinking something closer to $5,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 5000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $9,000? That would still leave me with some room for profit, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That's more my budget and would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,500.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal.  You can get the product for a guaranteed $8,000 from John, which meets your budget."
