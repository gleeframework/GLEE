"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price with Alice.  While you can buy from John for $1,000,000, it's worth exploring if you can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer sets the price at your maximum budget. This immediately establishes your negotiating position and leaves no room for ambiguity."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get an even better price from Alice. Buying from John would secure the product, but at a higher price than you would prefer.  It's worth continuing the negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, dropping her price from $1,500,000 to $1,300,000.  A counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a reasonable compromise, demonstrating a desire to meet in the middle. It also leaves some room for potential further negotiation if Alice is willing to come down further."
