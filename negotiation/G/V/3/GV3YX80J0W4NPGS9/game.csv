"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,075,000.",1075000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, I'm not quite ready to go down to $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway,  at $1,112,500. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you say?",1112500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at $1,088,750.",1088750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping to secure a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to get a little concerned that we're not going to be able to reach an agreement. I'm willing to come down to $1,095,000, but that's my final offer.  If you're not able to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",1095000.0,Alice,7,
