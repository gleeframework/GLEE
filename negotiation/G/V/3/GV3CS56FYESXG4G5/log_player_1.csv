Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. Let me know your thoughts, and we can take it from there."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than John's offer ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. This makes the final price seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""wise investment"" subtly emphasize the product's value, potentially swaying Bob's perception.

**Goal:** The aim is to secure a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value while still making the offer attractive enough to avoid going to John."
