Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $82. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer to your target price, it's unlikely she'll go below $80. You have a guaranteed offer from John at $80, so it makes more sense to take that deal and avoid further negotiation."
