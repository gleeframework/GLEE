Round 2

Round 6

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We're getting close to the end of our rounds, and while I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, it's time to lock in a deal. $10,250 is a decent price, and I'm confident I can get a similar offer from John in the next round if I need to."
