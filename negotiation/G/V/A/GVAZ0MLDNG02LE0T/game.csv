"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1200000. I am willing to pay up to $1000000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate the reduction to $1100000. However, I am still working within a strict budget. I am willing to offer $950000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable, and we can move forward with the transaction.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 is simply too low for me to accept at this point.
