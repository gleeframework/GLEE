,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $13,000, so I'll offer $12,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay.",12000.0,Bob,4,
