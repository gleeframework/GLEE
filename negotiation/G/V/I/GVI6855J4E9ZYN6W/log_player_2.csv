"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value to you, I understand it's worth $15,000. Considering its quality and the benefits it offers, I propose to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a special offer tailored to meet your needs and ensure you get the most out of this investment. I look forward to hearing your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Alice's price of $12,000 is lower than John's price of $15,000.
* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** The price of $12,000 is below Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. 

Therefore, it makes sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer and save $3,000."
