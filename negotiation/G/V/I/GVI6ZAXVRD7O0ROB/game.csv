"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This still reflects the product's value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down.  I'm getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000.  This represents a significant compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
