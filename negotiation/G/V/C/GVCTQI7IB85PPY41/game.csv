I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a steal! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to get it at a price that's below market value. I'm willing to let it go for $13500. What do you think?,13500.0,Alice,1,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm really keen on this product and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $13000?  I'm confident this is a fair price that allows you to make a profit while still saving me some money.",13000.0,Bob,4,
