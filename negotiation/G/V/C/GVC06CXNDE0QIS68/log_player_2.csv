"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still higher than what Bob wants to pay. It's beneficial to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $650,000.  This would still be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 650000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a compromise that I think will benefit both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $750,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. He should reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price again."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $700,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still believe the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $725,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the benefits you'll receive from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been trying to get the price down, and Alice has already made several concessions. While $725,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, it's lower than the price John is offering.  It's more beneficial for Bob to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a price that is still within his budget."
