"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $650,000.  This would still be a great deal for both of us.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a compromise that I think will benefit both of us.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $700,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still believe the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $725,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the benefits you'll receive from the product.",725000.0,Alice,5,
