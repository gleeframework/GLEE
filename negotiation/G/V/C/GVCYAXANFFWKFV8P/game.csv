"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $15000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $12000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product offers. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm prepared to pay $9000 for the product. This is a fair price given my budget constraints and the value I see in the product. I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand that you're working with a tight budget, Bob, but I'm still not sure if $9000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'm thinking more along the lines of $11000. I believe this is a more accurate reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,,
