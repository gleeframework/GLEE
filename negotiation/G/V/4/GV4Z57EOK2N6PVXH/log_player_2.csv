**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Alice is selling for $1,400,000, while John is selling for $1,500,000.
* **You can save money by accepting Alice's offer.**  You'll pay $100,000 less than what John is asking. 

Even though the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, it's still a good deal for you to accept her offer as you can still purchase it below your maximum budget."
