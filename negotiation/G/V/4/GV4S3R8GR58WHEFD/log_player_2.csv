"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to his maximum budget as possible while also leaving room for negotiation. A $7,500 offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for Alice to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $7,500 is a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum budget. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price. There's still room for Alice to come down, and rejecting the offer keeps the negotiating process going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $8,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $8,000 for the product. It's my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering his maximum price. He's clearly shown he's willing to negotiate, but this is his limit.  By calling it his ""final offer,"" he's putting pressure on Alice to accept and close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $8,100, but I'm not going any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but Bob is still $100 over his maximum budget. Since this is his last round of negotiation with Alice, it's time to cut his losses and go with John's offer.  At $8,000, John's offer is the best option to ensure Bob gets the product while staying within his financial constraints."
