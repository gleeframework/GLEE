"Alice, your offer of $20,000 is too high for me. Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $12,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate you coming down in price, $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $14,000. This price is still a good deal for you considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,
