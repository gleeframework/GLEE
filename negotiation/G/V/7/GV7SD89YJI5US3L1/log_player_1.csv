Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so any price below that gives him a surplus.
* **My minimum:** I won't sell for less than $8,000, so I need an offer higher than that.
* **Negotiation:** I'm offering $14,000, which is a good compromise. It gives me a significant profit over my minimum, but still leaves Bob with a good deal. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I can still sell the product to John for $8,000. This strategy maximizes my potential profit while still giving Bob a strong incentive to accept the offer."
