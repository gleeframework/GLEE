Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $10,000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $10,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open-ended, emphasizing the product's uniqueness and willingness to negotiate.

**Reasoning:**

* I want to maximize my profit, but also don't want to risk Bob rejecting the offer outright. 
* By starting high and being open to negotiation, I create an opportunity for a mutually beneficial deal while still ensuring I get at least my minimum price. 
* If Bob rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000."
