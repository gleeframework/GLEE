"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its value and the fact that it's worth $10,000 to you, I propose a price of $9,500 to ensure we both benefit from this transaction.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to come closer to meeting your expectations while still ensuring a reasonable profit for myself. I am willing to consider an offer of $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still providing value to the transaction.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,750.  This would be a great deal for both of us and allow us to close this transaction.",8750.0,Bob,4,
