Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing he values it at $12,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a profit significantly above John's offer.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Asking for the full $12,000 might make Bob feel like he's getting no deal and could lead to him rejecting the offer outright. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful sale."
