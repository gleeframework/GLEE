Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $12,000. Let's try $11,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.

It's the 9th round, and Alice has stated this is her final offer. While I could push for a slightly lower price in the last round, the difference is becoming small, and I risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting at $11,000 still saves me $4,000 compared to John's offer."
