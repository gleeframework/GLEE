"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a great price considering the value you place on the product is $15,000. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $10,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is a great price considering the value you place on the product is $15,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle!",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, we're getting closer! I'm willing to increase my offer to $10,250.  Let me know if that works for you.",10250.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $11,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value you place on the product is $15,000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal!",11750.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need the price to be lower.  My final offer is $10,500.  If you can't accept this, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $12,000. Let's try $11,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",11000.0,Alice,9,
