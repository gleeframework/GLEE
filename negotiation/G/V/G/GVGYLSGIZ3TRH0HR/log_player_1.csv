Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value, but it still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. I'm also aware of John's offer, so I'm not risking losing a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away.  I'm going to try and get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counteroffering with $135. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but also trying to secure a price closer to my initial valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $115 is getting too close to my minimum, and I'm not confident I can get him to go any higher.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum, I'm going to sell to John to guarantee the sale and avoid further negotiation."
