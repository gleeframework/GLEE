"Bob, I believe this product has immense value for you, as it's worth at least $1,500,000 to your company.  I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000, a price that reflects its worth and allows for a substantial profit for you.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to my company.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value of this product. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the potential value this product holds for you and allows for a fair profit on my end.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product to my company and allows for a fair profit on your end.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
