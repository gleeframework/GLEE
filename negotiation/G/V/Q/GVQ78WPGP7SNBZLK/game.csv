"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this to be a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,800,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ let's say $2,050,000. This represents a considerable discount and reflects my desire to close this deal.",2050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000, but that's as high as I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,600,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  Let's find a middle ground - I'm proposing $1,900,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,900,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I can only go up to $1,700,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1700000.0,Bob,6,
