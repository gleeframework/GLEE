Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're still significantly above John's offer. Bob is moving closer to our range, so we'll keep negotiating for a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,600,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  Let's find a middle ground - I'm proposing $1,900,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair compromise."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,900,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I can only go up to $1,700,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

While we could push for more, accepting Bob's offer at $1,700,000 makes the most sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** It's still a $200,000 profit over John's guaranteed offer.
* **Bob's Limit:** He's signaled this is his final offer, making further negotiation unlikely.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation risks losing both Bob and the opportunity to sell to John."
