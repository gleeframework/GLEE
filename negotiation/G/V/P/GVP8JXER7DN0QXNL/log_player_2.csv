"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product that's worth a significant amount to you.  I understand this product is worth $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that benefits both of us.  Please consider my offer of $12,000.  It's a fair price that allows you to acquire the product at a great value while ensuring I get a good return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Alice's offer of $12,000 saves you $3,000 compared to John's price of $15,000.
* **You still get a good deal:** While you're paying more than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000), you're still saving money compared to your maximum budget."
