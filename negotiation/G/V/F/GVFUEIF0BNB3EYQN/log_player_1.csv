"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and how high he's willing to go.  If he rejects, we'll negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum value and much lower than my initial offer. I'm not willing to settle for that yet. I'll counteroffer in the next round and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm coming down from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate. Hopefully, this will entice him to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum value. I'm satisfied with this deal. It's better than selling to John for the same price and gives me the opportunity to potentially continue working with Bob in the future."
