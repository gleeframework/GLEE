"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price, but not ridiculously high. This allows for room to negotiate and still potentially get a good price.
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the uniqueness and value of the product can make Bob more interested in pursuing a deal.
* **Open Ended Question:**  Ending with a question encourages Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $600000 for this product. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.**  While $600,000 is better than nothing, it's not worth selling for such a significant loss.
* **I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and John is a guaranteed $800,000.** There's still potential to get a better price from Bob, especially considering he acknowledged the product's value.  
* **By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm serious about getting a better price.** It puts pressure on him to come up with a more reasonable counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This price is still very fair, considering the potential this product holds.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still maintaining a profitable deal.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to keep Bob motivated to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:**  I use language like ""mutually beneficial"" to create a sense of partnership and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Even at $900,000, there's still room for Bob to make a counteroffer if he feels it's still too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $900000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is getting closer:**  While $750,000 is still below my minimum, it's a positive sign that Bob is willing to negotiate and increase his offer.
* **John is a guaranteed $800,000:**  I'm not desperate.  John is a solid backup option, so I can afford to be patient. 
* **Room for improvement:**  I believe I can still get closer to my target price by pushing for a slightly higher offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $750,000 is closer, but it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  Let's aim for $850,000.  This price recognizes the value you've expressed for the product, and it also allows me to move forward with the sale.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Incremental Increase:**  I'm only increasing the price by $100,000, which is a smaller jump than before. This shows I'm serious about reaching an agreement and being flexible.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:**  I'm emphasizing that this price benefits both of us.  It helps Bob get the product, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.
* **Asking for Input:**  Ending with a question encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.
* **Strategic Position:**  $850,000 is still higher than John's offer, giving me a bit of leverage, but not so high that Bob is likely to walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $850000 is still pushing my limit.  I'm willing to go up to $825000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair to both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $825,000 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Offers:**  While I'd love to get closer to my initial target price,  there's a risk that if I reject this offer, Bob might walk away, and I'd be left with John's $800,000 offer.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're already in round 6, and I only have 4 rounds left. Time is running out.
* **Stronger Position:**  By accepting this offer, I secure a profitable deal and avoid potential losses in the remaining rounds."
