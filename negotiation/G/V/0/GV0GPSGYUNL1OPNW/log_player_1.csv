"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I want to see if I can get Bob to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs while still offering you a great deal."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  How about we settle at $13,000? That's a significant price for me, and I believe it's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can push a little further and secure a better deal. It's worth seeing if we can find a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try $14,000.  That's a fair compromise that's more in line with my expectations. I'm confident this is a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting close to my limit. Would you consider $13,250? I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While I was hoping to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob seems unwilling to go higher than $13,250.  Selling to John will allow me to achieve my minimum profit goal, and it's a safer bet than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
