"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to consider $9,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've had other interested parties in the past who were willing to pay more for this product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,200 for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already mentioned that I'm willing to sell the product to John for $10,000, so I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to meet you at the $10,000 mark, but I'm not budging further. Take it or leave it.",10000.0,Alice,5,
