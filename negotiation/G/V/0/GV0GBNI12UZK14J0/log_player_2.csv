"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's something truly valuable, and I believe it has the potential to be incredibly beneficial for you.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to her, but it's still too expensive for Bob. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $900,000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about $1,050,000?  This price would still allow you a significant return on your investment, and it's closer to my valuation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,050,000 is still more than Bob wants to pay. He can likely get a better deal if he continues negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $975,000 is a step in the right direction,  I'm still hoping we can find a price that reflects the true value of this product for both of us. How about we settle on $1,000,000? This would be a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still higher than Bob's target price. While it's closer, Bob is still better off continuing to negotiate for a lower price.  He has several rounds left, so he can afford to be patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. Let's try $985,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  "", ""product_price"": 985000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  we're getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from your offer.  I'm willing to go down to $995,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy with this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $995,000. While Bob's target was lower, this offer is only $10,000 higher. It's getting increasingly risky to continue negotiating and risk losing the deal to John.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best option at this point to secure the product at a good price."
