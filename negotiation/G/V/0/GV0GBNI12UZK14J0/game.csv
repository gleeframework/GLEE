"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's something truly valuable, and I believe it has the potential to be incredibly beneficial for you.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $900,000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about $1,050,000?  This price would still allow you a significant return on your investment, and it's closer to my valuation.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $975,000 is a step in the right direction,  I'm still hoping we can find a price that reflects the true value of this product for both of us. How about we settle on $1,000,000? This would be a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. Let's try $985,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  ",985000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  we're getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from your offer.  I'm willing to go down to $995,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy with this deal.",995000.0,Alice,7,
