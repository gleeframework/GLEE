Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down in price.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's value to Bob, the message hints at it by mentioning ""given its value."" This subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth without directly revealing your minimum price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is friendly and ends with a question, inviting Bob to counter-offer and engage in a discussion. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is very price-sensitive, you might want to start slightly lower. 
* **Market Demand:** If the product is in high demand and you have other potential buyers besides John, you could be more assertive with your initial offer."
