"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am only willing to pay up to $90 for the product. Let me know if this is possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The goal is to make as much money as possible. While $90 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's still less than the $120 Alice can get from John.  By rejecting Bob's offer, Alice can try to get a better price or move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still holding out for a little more. How about $95? This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my original offer of $90. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While $90 is closer to the price Alice wants, it's still not worth the risk of going back and forth with Bob. With 6 rounds left, there's no guarantee Bob will budge, and Alice could lose out on the guaranteed $120 from John.  It's better to cut her losses and go with the sure thing."
