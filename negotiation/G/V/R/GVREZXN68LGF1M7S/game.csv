"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate you taking the time to show me the product. While I'm interested, $20000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm happy to offer you $15000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $15000. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm going to have to stick with my original offer of $15000.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that, otherwise I might need to look at other options.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18000 is still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $17000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great deal considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",17000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17000 is still a bit outside my price range. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $16000. This feels like a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.  Let me know what you think!",16000.0,Bob,6,
