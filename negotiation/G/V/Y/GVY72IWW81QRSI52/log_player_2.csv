"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $900,000 is still a significant amount above Alice's value of $800,000.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a significant step towards Alice's value of $800,000. It shows Bob is serious about buying but wants a better price. There's still a $50,000 difference, so there's room for further negotiation if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is actually higher than her initial offer.  This suggests she's not as eager to sell at a lower price as Bob initially thought.  Rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer is a better strategy. Bob can try to push Alice closer to his desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to split the difference between his previous offer of $850,000 and Alice's counteroffer of $920,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price lower than Alice's current offer. The goal is to keep pushing towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than what Bob wants to pay.  Although the negotiation seems to be getting closer to a potential deal, there's still room to push for a lower price. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to continue aiming for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again trying to split the difference, this time between his previous offer of $875,000 and Alice's current offer of $915,000. This approach shows a willingness to meet in the middle while still pushing for a price lower than Alice's current offer.  This approach should keep the negotiation moving towards a potential deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous one, it's still higher than Bob's desired price.  There's only a small difference between Alice's offer and Bob's last counteroffer. Bob should continue trying to push the price down closer to his target. There are still a few rounds remaining, and there's a good chance he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now willing to meet Alice halfway, offering $900,000, which is the midpoint between his previous offer of $890,000 and Alice's offer of $912,500.  This shows a strong commitment to closing the deal, but with only two rounds left, he needs to get a quick agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round of negotiations.  With only one round left, it's highly unlikely Alice will budge further.   Accepting the offer for $910,000 is the best option. This price is still significantly below what Bob would have to pay John, and it's closer to his desired price than any of the other offers."
