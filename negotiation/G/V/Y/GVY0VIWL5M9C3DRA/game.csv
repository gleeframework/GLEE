"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $82.50 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about we settle at $80?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to buy the product then.",80.0,Bob,4,
