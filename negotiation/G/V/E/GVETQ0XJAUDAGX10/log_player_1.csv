"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a bit of a gamble, but it allows for some room to negotiate down if Bob is interested but thinks the price is too high. I'm confident the product is worth at least $8,000 to me, so I'm not afraid to start high and see what happens."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell.  I believe I can get a better price with a counteroffer.  I'll see if I can push Bob a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum.  Hopefully, Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is now offering $8,500, which is closer to my desired price.  Since I have limited rounds, I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price or losing the deal altogether.  $8,500 is a good compromise and secures a sale."
