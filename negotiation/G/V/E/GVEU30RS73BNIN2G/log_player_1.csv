Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the dynamics:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see significant value in.  I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This represents a significant discount compared to its true worth to you, while still ensuring a fair deal for me.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  You know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,200,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation ($1,400,000) creates a strong incentive for him to accept. This price lets you capture a significant portion of the value difference ($300,000) while still exceeding your minimum.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 with John gives you leverage to aim higher with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Relationship:** If maintaining a positive long-term relationship with Bob is crucial, you might consider a slightly lower price for a more collaborative feel.
* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you have insights into Bob's negotiation tactics (e.g., aggressive bargainer), you may need to adjust your approach."
