{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above the product's value to Bob ($1,050,000), hoping to maximize my profit.
* **Fairness and reason:** I'm emphasizing the value the product brings to Bob, hoping to encourage him to accept the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message is open-ended, leaving space for Bob to counter-offer if he's not happy with the initial price.

**Strategy:**

This strategy balances a desire for a high profit with the need to stay open to negotiation. By starting slightly above Bob's perceived value and leaving room for discussion, I aim to secure a price that's favorable while avoiding an impasse that would force me to sell to John for the minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,050,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my initial offer and my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept a price that undervalues the product and my own time spent negotiating. 

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's counteroffer allows me to maintain leverage and potentially secure a higher price.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired outcome, keeping in mind that I can always accept John's offer if the negotiation with Bob stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is lower than my initial offer, it's still a significant investment for you. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower the price to $975,000. This reflects both the value the product brings to you and my willingness to reach an agreement.  I believe this price is fair and allows us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer closer to Bob's value:**  I'm lowering the price from my previous offer, but still remaining above Bob's offer. 
* **Emphasis on value & compromise:**  I reiterate the value the product brings to Bob and highlight my willingness to compromise, framing it as a fair solution.
* **Clear next steps:**  I explicitly state that this offer aims to allow the negotiation to move forward, creating pressure for Bob to respond.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum, I'm showing flexibility while maintaining leverage. This counteroffer aims to test Bob's willingness to compromise and potentially secure a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm making a counteroffer of $962,500. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $962,500 is still below my minimum desired price, it's very close and represents a significant compromise from his previous offer. Continuing to negotiate further risks a stalemate and might push Bob to walk away, leading me to sell to John for a lower price.

**Strategy:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a profitable sale while avoiding further negotiation that could result in a less favorable outcome. The risk of Bob walking away and the potential for a longer negotiation process outweigh the slight decrease in profit."
