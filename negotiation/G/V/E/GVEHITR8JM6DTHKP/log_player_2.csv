"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me and allows you to still make a profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,575,000. This price still gives you a good deal, and allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,575,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $1,575,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,500,000.  While it's getting closer, it's not a deal I'm willing to accept yet. I'll counteroffer again to try and get closer to my target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,575,000 is still slightly out of my range.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $1,525,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it's closer to your desired price. Let's reach an agreement and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1525000}
