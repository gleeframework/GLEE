"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I understand your perspective,  $1000000 is a bit too low for me to consider at this time. I'm willing to come down to $1100000, reflecting a  significant discount from my initial price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
