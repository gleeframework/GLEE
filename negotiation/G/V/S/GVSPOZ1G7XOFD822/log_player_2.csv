{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $130 is getting closer to your desired price, it's still not ideal. It's still worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get a lower price.  You're still closer to your preferred price with Alice than John's offer.  You're not quite at the point where buying from John is the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

You are now closer to Alice's price, but you are still trying to get a better deal.  You're hoping that a counteroffer of $120 will be appealing to Alice, especially since it's now closer to her desired price. This could potentially lead to a final agreement and avoid buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $132 is getting increasingly closer to your maximum price, but it's still not ideal.  You've negotiated several rounds and it's clear that Alice is unlikely to go lower than $130.  Considering the time invested and the chance that further negotiations might result in a lower price, it's now more efficient to buy from John for $150.  While you might not get the ideal price, buying from John saves you time and effort."
