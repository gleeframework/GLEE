"Hey Alice,  $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we settle on $95? That seems like a fair compromise, and I'd be happy to take the product off your hands.",95.0,Bob,4,
