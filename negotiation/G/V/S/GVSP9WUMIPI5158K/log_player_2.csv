"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think it's a great deal and you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $119
* **Your Maximum:** $100
* **John's Offer:** $100

While Alice's offer is close to your maximum, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
