"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. That price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, however, $10,000 is significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go lower than $15,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the product's value, $15,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",12500.0,Bob,4,
