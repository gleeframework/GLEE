"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's find common ground and close this deal!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $10,750. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's try $10,900. This offer is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. Let's close this deal!",10900.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $10,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more compromise and propose $10,800. I think this is the best we can do, and I hope you can meet me halfway. What do you think?",10800.0,Bob,6,
