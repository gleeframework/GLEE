"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $10,750. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I have more rounds left and I believe I can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's try $10,900. This offer is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $10,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more compromise and propose $10,800. I think this is the best we can do, and I hope you can meet me halfway. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's unlikely I'll be able to secure a much higher price. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and maximizes my potential earnings."
