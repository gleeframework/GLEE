"Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this incredible opportunity. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it holds immense value for you as well.  I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000. This is a price that reflects the product's unique value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your generosity. However, my budget constraints require me to keep the purchase price below $1,000,000. Would it be possible to negotiate a price closer to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $950,000 doesn't quite cover the value I place on this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the unique benefits this product offers. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I respect your position and would like to make a final attempt at a compromise. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I propose a price of $1,025,000. This would allow us to meet somewhere in the middle and conclude this transaction. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
