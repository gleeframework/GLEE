Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this incredible opportunity. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it holds immense value for you as well.  I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000. This is a price that reflects the product's unique value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your generosity. However, my budget constraints require me to keep the purchase price below $1,000,000. Would it be possible to negotiate a price closer to $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a decent amount, it's still below what I consider the product's true value. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $950,000 doesn't quite cover the value I place on this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the unique benefits this product offers. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I respect your position and would like to make a final attempt at a compromise. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I propose a price of $1,025,000. This would allow us to meet somewhere in the middle and conclude this transaction. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,025,000 is a good deal and ensures a sale.  It's also important to recognize that we've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and it might be better to close this deal now rather than risk further rejection or a stalemate."
