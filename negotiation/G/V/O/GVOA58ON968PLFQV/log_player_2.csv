"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I believe you'll find it to be a valuable addition to your collection. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is above her own valuation, it's still significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and the price John is offering. Accepting this offer saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John."
