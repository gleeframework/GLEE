"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position, $1300000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1350000. This price still allows for a significant profit for you and is closer to my minimum asking price. Let me know if you're open to this.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
