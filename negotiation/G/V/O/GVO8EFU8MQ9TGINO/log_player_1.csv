Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
