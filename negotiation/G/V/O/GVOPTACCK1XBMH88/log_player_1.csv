Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $15,000 is already a very competitive price for this product.  Could you meet me halfway at $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. Unfortunately, I still cannot meet at $12,500. My maximum budget remains at $10,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

Explanation: Bob has made it clear that his maximum budget is $10,000.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to result in a better offer. Accepting the $12,000 from John is the best way to maximize profit in this scenario."
