"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I'm extending this exclusive offer to you at a special price of $95. This is an opportunity not to be missed, considering the product's true worth is $100. I look forward to hearing your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You value the product at $100, and Alice is offering it for $95. While this is a good deal, you can get it for $100 from John. Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
