Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a higher price in the next round.  While $12,000 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $12,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise between my budget and the value of the item. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. I'm getting close to my ideal price, and Bob seems willing to compromise. I'd rather lock in the sale now than risk losing out on a potential deal and having to sell to John for my minimum price."
