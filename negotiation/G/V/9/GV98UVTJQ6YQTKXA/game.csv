"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $600,000 is a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $500,000? I think that's a fair price.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit far from meeting you in the middle. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $550,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits the product will bring to your business. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",550000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $550,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $475,000. This price point aligns better with my financial plans for this quarter.  What do you think?",475000.0,Bob,4,

Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $525,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits the product will bring to your business.
