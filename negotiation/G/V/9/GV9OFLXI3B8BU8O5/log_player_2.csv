"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that aligns with your interests. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is close to your maximum, it's still above your target. You have room to negotiate and potentially save some money.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is only $75,000 above your target price of $1,200,000. While you could continue to negotiate, it's a good price considering the limited number of rounds. Accepting the offer minimizes the risk of losing the deal and ensures you acquire the product at a reasonable cost."
