Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 undervalues the product's unique features and potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the true value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
