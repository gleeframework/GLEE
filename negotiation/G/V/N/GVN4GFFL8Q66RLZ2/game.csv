"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 undervalues the product's unique features and potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the true value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,900,000 is closer to my range, it's still above what I can reasonably pay.  I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.  I believe this offer gives us both a good outcome.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
