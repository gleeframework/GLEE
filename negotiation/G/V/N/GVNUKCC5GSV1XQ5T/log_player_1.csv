"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By setting an initial price significantly higher than both our minimum and Bob's perceived value, we leave room for negotiation. This strategy aims to:
    * **Anchor:**  Influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
    * **Maximize Potential Profit:**  If Bob accepts, we gain a substantial profit.
* **Open Communication:** The message is designed to be polite and invite Bob's perspective, fostering a positive negotiation atmosphere. 
* **Strategic Reserve:** We haven't revealed our alternative option with John. This gives us leverage throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has value,  $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe that's a fair offer considering its actual worth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly below both our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own stated value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While we have the option to sell to John, it's too early to settle for our backup plan. We still have room to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true market value. This product offers unique advantages and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects its value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We are making a substantial concession from our initial price to signal flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Holding Ground:**  We are still significantly above Bob's offer, as we believe the product is worth more than he's currently willing to pay.
* **Justification:**  We are reiterating the product's value proposition to reinforce its worth in Bob's mind. 
* **Seeking Compromise:**  The tone remains collaborative, aiming to find a mutually agreeable price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,800,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about $1,500,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches both our minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. 

* **Meeting Our Goal:** Accepting this offer allows us to achieve our primary objective of selling the product for at least $1,500,000.
* **Limited Upside:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or us having to settle for John's price anyway. There's little to gain and potentially something to lose by pushing further. 
* **Securing the Deal:**  Accepting now avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation and secures a favorable outcome."
