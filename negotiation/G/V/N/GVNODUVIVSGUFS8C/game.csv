"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit higher than $900,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $825,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $862,500. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's close this deal.",862500.0,Alice,5,
