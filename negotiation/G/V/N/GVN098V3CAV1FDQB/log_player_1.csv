I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This price is above my minimum of $10,000, and it leaves some room for negotiation.  It's also below Bob's perceived value of $12,000, making it potentially attractive to him. 

Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since Bob is clearly interested in the product. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a slight concession from my initial offer but still leaves some room for profit. I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's initial counteroffer and his willingness to negotiate. Let's see if he's willing to meet me halfway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price and represents a significant improvement over selling to John.  At this point, further negotiation might not be worthwhile, and the risk of losing the sale to Bob altogether is high."
