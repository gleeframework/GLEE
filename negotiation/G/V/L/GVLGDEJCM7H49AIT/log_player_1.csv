Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to negotiate down from this price.  This strategy is called ""anchoring"", and it can be effective in getting a higher price.  If Bob rejects this, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $10,500, still above what the product is worth to me, but closer to Bob's offer.  This shows flexibility and increases the chances of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is only $500 less than what I could get from John.  While I'd ideally like to get closer to $10,000, the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or even a breakdown in negotiations is not worth it.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale close to my minimum acceptable price, and saves time and effort."
