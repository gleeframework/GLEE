"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We know we can get it cheaper, either from Alice through negotiation or from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
 ""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good strategy to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your desired price, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a polite and respectful tone can help facilitate a smoother negotiation process.
* **Targeting a Good Deal:**  While we want to save money, aiming for a price around $90 gives Alice room to potentially lower her price while still securing us a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $100 is still above our target price. We have room to negotiate further before considering John's offer.  Alice seems willing to bargain, so another counteroffer is our best bet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. Let's try $95, how does that sound?"",
 ""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We are moving closer to Alice's price, showing willingness to compromise, but in smaller increments.
* **Staying Below John's Price:**  We still have a buffer before reaching John's offer of $120.
* **Testing Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help us gauge how much further Alice is willing to lower her price."
