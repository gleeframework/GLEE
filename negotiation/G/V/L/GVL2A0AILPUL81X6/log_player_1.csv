Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** I'm beginning the negotiation close to Bob's perceived value ($120) to maximize potential profit.  
* **Leave Room to Negotiate:**  The $110 offer provides space for Bob to counter-offer and feel like he's getting a deal, while still ensuring I'm well above my minimum acceptable price ($80). 
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer at $80. This gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a decent profit, I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob.  Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than his perceived value, suggesting there's room for him to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting we ""meet in the middle,"" I'm showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate and find a price that works for both of us.
* **Strong Position:** $100 is still a significant profit margin for me and a reasonable price considering its value to Bob. 
* **Time Factor:** While I'm open to further negotiation, I'm conscious that I have a guaranteed offer from John.  I'll assess Bob's response and decide if I need to move closer to my minimum or take John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. Let's try $95, how does that sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** $95 is a good price, providing a solid $15 profit over my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating he's motivated to buy. It's unlikely he'll move much higher.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob altogether. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids potentially having to settle for John's lower offer."
