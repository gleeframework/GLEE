Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price of $1,800,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers, and still potentially earn significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm also aware that John is a backup buyer, so I'm not overly concerned about rejecting a low counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and even lower than what John is willing to pay. I will reject his offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,500,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still higher than what Bob offered and what John is willing to pay. I hope to meet somewhere in the middle and secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to get more, it's not worth risking the deal by continuing to negotiate.  Selling to Bob at $1,200,000 guarantees me my minimum profit."
