"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $100 for it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than your minimum, leaving room for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, it's worth exploring if we can get closer to our desired price.  Rejecting his offer allows us to make a counteroffer and potentially increase the final price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm happy to come down a bit, but $80 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? This gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can meet you at $90, but I'm willing to go up to $85. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $85 is close to our minimum, we're still within our negotiation rounds and there's potential for him to go higher.  Rejecting the offer allows us to make another counteroffer and try to get closer to our desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price point, but $85 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to come down to $88 to make this deal happen.  Let's close this out and both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit off. I'd be willing to meet you at $82. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

We are getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. While Bob's offer of $82 is still slightly lower than our ideal price, it's a reasonable price given that our minimum is $80.  Accepting the offer ensures we secure a sale without risking losing the deal entirely."
