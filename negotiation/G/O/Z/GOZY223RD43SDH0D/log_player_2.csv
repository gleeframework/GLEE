"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see a more substantial offer. How about $1,050,000? This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you can still benefit from.  Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go lower than $1,000,000. This price is fair considering the product's value to both of us.  I believe it's in your best interest to consider this offer.  If we can't reach an agreement, I may need to explore other options.
