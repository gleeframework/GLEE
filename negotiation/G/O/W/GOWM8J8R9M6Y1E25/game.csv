"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $85 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a great price for you considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can close this deal!",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $95 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $90, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer!  I'm willing to come down to $92.  This is a good price for both of us, and it keeps me from having to sell to someone else.  Let's make this happen!",92.0,Alice,5,
