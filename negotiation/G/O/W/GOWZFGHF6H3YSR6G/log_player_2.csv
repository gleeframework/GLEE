"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a better price than John's $1,500,000, there's still room for negotiation. You can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $850,000, which is still a decent profit for Alice ($50,000 above her value) but significantly lower than her initial offer. This should start the negotiation process and hopefully lead to a more favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is still better than John's price, it's closer to Alice's initial offer, suggesting she's not willing to budge much. I will reject and make another counteroffer, hoping to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $900,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, showing I'm serious about buying the product. It also provides Alice with a good profit margin ($100,000 above her value).  Hopefully, this will be a more acceptable price for her, leading to a successful transaction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is increasing her offer, indicating she's not budging much. My previous counteroffer was rejected, meaning we are at a stalemate. At this point, buying from John for $1,500,000 is a better option, as it guarantees a purchase and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
