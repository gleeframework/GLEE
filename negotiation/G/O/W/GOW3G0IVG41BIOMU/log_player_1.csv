"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a starting point:**  It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** The message highlights the potential benefit to Bob, framing it as a ""great deal"" rather than just a high price. 
* **Open-ended question:**  Encourages Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only willing to pay up to $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push for a higher price in subsequent rounds.
* **Avoiding immediate sale to John:**  I want to exhaust all options with Bob first, as selling to John would lock in a profit but potentially leave more money on the table if I could get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $9,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price, considering the value I place on this product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm also showing willingness to negotiate by offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and his.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I frame the counteroffer as a ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Open-ended question:**  Again, I end with a question to encourage further discussion and potentially reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $10,000. I hope this is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still some potential to negotiate further.  I want to see if I can get Bob closer to my target price. 
* **Avoiding immediate sale to John:**  I'm not willing to settle for $10,000 just yet.  I want to explore if there's a better outcome with Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I acknowledge your budget, $10,000 simply doesn't cover the value I've placed on this item.  To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is my final offer, considering the limited time we have.  I'm confident this is a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final offer:** This is my last chance to negotiate with Bob before potentially selling to John.
* **Small compromise:** I'm only coming down slightly, showing I'm serious about getting a deal with Bob while still maintaining a price that's closer to my target.
* **Time pressure:**  I add urgency by mentioning the ""limited time"" we have, subtly influencing Bob to accept.
* **Fair compromise:** I emphasize that this is a ""fair compromise"" to make it sound appealing and mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, and I respect your valuation of the product. However, based on my budget and other financial considerations, I would like to propose a final price of $9,500. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $9,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, even with the limited time pressure.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Further negotiation with Bob is likely to lead to more concessions from my end, potentially lowering the final price even further.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $15,000, which is my desired minimum and allows me to avoid any further risk. 

**At this point, the potential gains from continuing to negotiate with Bob are outweighed by the risk of lowering my price further and the certainty of a good deal with John.**"
