# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,500,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe you'll find it incredibly beneficial for your needs. This is a fair price, considering its worth to you, and it would be a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
