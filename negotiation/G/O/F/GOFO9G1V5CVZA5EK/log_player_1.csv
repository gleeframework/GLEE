Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $950,000. This is a strong opening offer that reflects the value of the product to me while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This means he has a potential profit margin of $150,000.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** By starting at $950,000, I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, potentially reaching a price point that's mutually beneficial. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** The presence of John, willing to pay $800,000, provides a safety net.  I can always walk away from the negotiation with Bob and sell to John if the price doesn't reach a satisfactory level for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Strategy:** While $900,000 is a decent price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price point by continuing the negotiation.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I'm confident that Bob is motivated to buy the product and that I can push for a higher price in the next round.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John for $800,000 is a guaranteed option, I'm willing to take a calculated risk to potentially earn more by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm making a slight counter-offer, increasing the price by $25,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise while also maintaining a strong negotiating position.
* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer is halfway between my initial offer of $950,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000. This demonstrates a willingness to find common ground.
* **Maintaining Value:** The price of $925,000 is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, ensuring I maintain a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Deal:** Bob's offer of $920,000 is very close to my desired price point and significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk that Bob may walk away or that we may get stuck in a stalemate. Accepting this offer minimizes risk and secures a profitable sale.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now allows me to secure the funds sooner, which can be beneficial for my business."
