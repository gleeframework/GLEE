Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer gives Bob a good deal, as he still gets the product for $50,000 less than its value to him. However, it also gives me a substantial profit, exceeding my minimum goal of $1,000,000.  

I'm aiming to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal with Bob. This offer leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob is hesitant but also ensures I'm not giving away too much of my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum goal of $1,000,000, I believe I can still secure a better price. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me and potentially reach a price closer to my initial offer of $1,150,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $1,100,000 and my previous offer of $1,150,000. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profit that's significantly higher than my minimum goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum goal, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'm confident that I can reach a more favorable deal by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This counteroffer is a final attempt to close the deal with Bob. I'm willing to meet him at his latest offer, as it still brings me a profit that exceeds my minimum goal. If he rejects this offer, I'll move on to selling the product to John, as further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

At this point, the negotiation has reached a stalemate. While Bob's latest offer is just slightly below my initial counteroffer, I'm hesitant to continue haggling. It's unlikely we'll agree on a price that satisfies both of us, and further negotiation would be time-consuming. 

Selling to John guarantees me my minimum goal of $1,000,000 and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
