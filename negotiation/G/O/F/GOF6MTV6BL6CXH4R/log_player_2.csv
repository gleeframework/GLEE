Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, the product is worth a lot to me, and I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. That said, $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle on $720,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 720000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $720,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $900,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000.  You can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's no point in continuing negotiations with Alice."
