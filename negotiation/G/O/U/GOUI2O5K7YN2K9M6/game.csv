"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $12,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is still a great price for a product like this, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I am still unable to meet you at $16,000. I would like to propose $14,000 as a fair price for the product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $15,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,5,
