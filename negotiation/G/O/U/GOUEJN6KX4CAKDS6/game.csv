"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your perspective, but $800,000 falls quite short of what I had in mind. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. How about $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,
