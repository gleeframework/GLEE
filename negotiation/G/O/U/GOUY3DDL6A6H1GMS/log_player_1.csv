"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $1,100,000 is a good offer, it's still below my desired price. I'll counter-offer to get closer to my target."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to go down to $1,100,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? It's still a significant discount for you and gets us closer to closing the deal."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $1,087,500? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I am not ready to settle for anything below $1,100,000 at this point. I am confident I can secure a better deal with Bob or with John, as I still have several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I can't go any lower than $1,100,000. This product is worth significantly more to you than that, and it's crucial for me to receive a fair price.  Let's meet halfway at $1,100,000 and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, which is my absolute maximum. I hope you can understand my position and consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm running out of rounds.  Even though I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, I don't want to risk losing out completely. It's better to secure a sale with John for $1,000,000 than to risk getting nothing at all."
