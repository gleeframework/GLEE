"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. It's a unique opportunity to own a truly exceptional item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's find a mutually agreeable price.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $750,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to go up to $675,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and is a good compromise on both sides. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",675000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to go down to $725,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. I'm getting close to your offer, but I still need to make a profit.",725000.0,Alice,5,
