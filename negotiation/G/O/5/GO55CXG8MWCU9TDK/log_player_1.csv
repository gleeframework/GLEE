Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $120, we start with a higher offer ($135) to test his willingness to pay. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer allows room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. It signals that you're aiming for a slightly higher profit margin but are open to discussion.
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer without overthinking. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can always propose a lower price, gradually approaching his maximum valuation of $120. The key is to maximize profit while ensuring the deal doesn't fall through."
