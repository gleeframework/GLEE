"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and positive, emphasizing the value of the product and encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Strategy:**  This first offer sets the stage for a negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a price closer to my desired value, and I want to gauge his level of interest. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejection:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $9,000. While it's closer to my desired price than his first offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value.
* **Strategy:** I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $15,000. I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm not desperate and that I'm willing to continue the negotiation process. I'll counter with a price that is closer to my desired value and see if I can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $10,500? This is a fair price that considers both our positions. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $10,500. This is halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Message:** The message is polite and encouraging, emphasizing the fairness of the offer and framing it as a win-win solution for both of us.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer positions me as a reasonable negotiator while staying firm on my minimum acceptable value. I hope this will encourage Bob to reconsider and accept the offer. If he rejects, I'll continue to adjust my counteroffers to find a middle ground, always keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can we meet in the middle at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejection:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $9,500. While it's closer to my desired price than his previous offers, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Strategy:** I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a better price, but I'm also aware that I have a fallback option with John who is willing to pay $15,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer gives me another opportunity to send a counteroffer and try to push the price higher. 
* **Next Steps:** In the next round, I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to my target price of $10,500, but I will keep in mind that if Bob continues to reject my offers, I might have to consider selling to John to secure the higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to go down to $10,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. I believe this is a win-win scenario for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $10,000. This is closer to my desired price than my previous offer, but it's still lower than my minimum acceptable value. I hope this demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Message:** The message is positive and emphasizes the win-win aspect of the deal. I highlight the value of the product and reiterate my willingness to compromise.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer is a strategic move to bridge the gap between our positions. I'm aiming to secure a price that is both acceptable to me and within Bob's budget. If he rejects this offer, I will carefully assess my options and consider the possibility of selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,250 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejection:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $9,250. While we are getting closer to a deal, it's still below my minimum acceptable value.
* **Strategy:**  I'm still holding out for a better price. While I'm starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling rounds, I'm not ready to sell to John yet.  I want to see if I can get Bob closer to my desired price.
* **Next Steps:** In the next round, I will send a counteroffer that is closer to my desired value, but I will also assess if selling to John is becoming a more attractive option."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I appreciate your persistence, but $9,250 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? It's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product, and it gets us both closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $9,750. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer and a decrease from my previous offer, showing flexibility. It's also halfway between our current positions.
* **Message:** I'm staying positive and emphasizing a win-win scenario.  I'm highlighting the progress we've made and trying to create a sense of urgency to close the deal.
* **Strategy:** I'm trying to find a compromise that is acceptable to both of us.  I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, but I'm also aware that time is running out. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $9,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. Can we agree on that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Sell to John:**  We are down to the last two rounds. It's getting increasingly likely that we won't be able to agree on a price with Bob.  While Bob's latest offer is the closest we've gotten, it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  
* **Strategy:** With only two rounds left, it's a gamble to keep negotiating. There's a good chance we won't get a price I'm happy with.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John than risk getting stuck with a lower price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I would prefer to earn more, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is too high. The guaranteed sale to John provides the best outcome considering the time constraint."
