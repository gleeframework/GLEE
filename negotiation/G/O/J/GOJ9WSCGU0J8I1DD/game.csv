"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $10,500? This is a fair price that considers both our positions. Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can we meet in the middle at that price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to go down to $10,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. I believe this is a win-win scenario for both of us. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting close! I appreciate your persistence, but $9,250 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? It's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product, and it gets us both closer to a deal. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $9,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. Can we agree on that?",9500.0,Bob,8,
