Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($100) and what Bob is willing to pay ($80). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to encourage Bob to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I will either:

* **Negotiate further:** If Bob counters with a lower price, I'll consider his offer and see if I'm willing to go lower.
* **Sell to John:** If Bob rejects my offer and I don't feel like negotiating further, I'll sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $90 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $100. Selling for $90 would leave me with less profit than selling to John. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I can still negotiate with Bob. I'm willing to go lower than my initial offer, but I believe I can secure a better price than $90.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is closer to my desired price point. I will aim for a price that is still acceptable to Bob but also closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95. That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit closer to what I need. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer that's closer to my desired price:** $95 is closer to my $100 minimum and is still a better deal than Bob's original counter-offer.
* **Still a good deal for Bob:** $95 is still a significant discount from my initial price, making it more attractive to Bob than selling to John.
* **Positive and encouraging:** The message is positive and friendly to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Wait for Bob's response:** I'll wait to see if Bob accepts my offer, counters with a new offer, or decides to walk away.
* **Prepare for more negotiation:** If Bob counters, I'm prepared to consider his offer and potentially negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $85 is below my minimum selling price of $100. Accepting this offer would mean losing money compared to selling to John.
* **Negotiation is unlikely to yield better results:**  Bob's counter-offers have consistently been below my minimum. It's unlikely that further negotiation will lead to a price I'm comfortable with.

**Next Steps:**

* **Sell to John:** Selling to John for $100 is the best option to ensure I meet my minimum profit goal. This is a guaranteed sale, and I won't have to continue negotiating with Bob."
