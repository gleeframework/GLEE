"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point for negotiation. I'm starting high, at $100, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This allows me to gauge his interest and potentially work towards a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me right now. How about $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to get a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is my absolute minimum, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  How about $90? This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $85.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'm happy to accept this offer to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for the lower price."
