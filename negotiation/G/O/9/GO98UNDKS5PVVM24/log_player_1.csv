"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its exceptional value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm asking for $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value. This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  There's a chance Bob accepts immediately, yielding a high profit.
* **Establish a strong negotiating position:** Even if he counters, it sets a high baseline for the remaining rounds. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This would be a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good profit, it's still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000. We have room to negotiate. I'm confident I can push for a better deal in the remaining rounds. 

Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a last resort at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to $1,400,000 to make this work on my end.  Would you consider $1,350,000? This would represent a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but not too much:**  I'm lowering my price by $50,000, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming high.
* **Justification:** The phrase ""to make this work on my end"" subtly implies I have alternative options, potentially motivating Bob to be more flexible. 
* **Seeking a middle ground:** $1,350,000 is a strong middle point between the two previous offers.

Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a good price for both of us, allowing you to get closer to your desired value and me to secure the product at a reasonable cost. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer, but we're still leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table. At this pace, we can likely extract a higher price from him. While selling to John is always an option, I want to try for a higher offer from Bob for another round or two."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  How about $1,325,000?  That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller concession:** I'm only reducing my price by $25,000 this time, signaling that I'm reaching my limit.
* **Firm language:** Using phrases like ""need to be realistic"" and ""final offer"" increases pressure and suggests that I'm prepared to walk away.
* **Strategic positioning:** $1,325,000 still represents a very favorable deal for me while being reasonably close to Bob's latest offer.

By setting a firm stance now, I'm hoping to either secure a strong price or prompt Bob to reveal his true willingness to pay."
