Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** The minimum you'll accept is $1,500,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum value. This means a deal is impossible unless Bob is willing to pay more than it's worth to him (unlikely in a rational negotiation).

**The Optimal Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your reservation price, there's no reason to offer a price below that to Bob. Your best move is to offer a price slightly above Bob's value, knowing he'll likely reject it. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. This offer is time-sensitive as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Why This Strategy Works**

* **Anchoring:**  You're anchoring the negotiation at a price above Bob's valuation, potentially shifting his perception of the product's worth. 
* **No Loss:** You know Bob will likely reject this offer. You then sell to John at your desired price. 
* **Time Pressure:**  The message implies scarcity, potentially making Bob act quicker if he reconsiders.

**Important Note:** This assumes a one-shot negotiation. If you had multiple rounds to negotiate with Bob, you might try to uncover his true valuation and explore options within the ZOPA (if one exists)."
