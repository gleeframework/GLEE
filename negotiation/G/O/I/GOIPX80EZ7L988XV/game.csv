"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $95 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $95 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to sell it for $105. This is a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",105.0,Alice,5,

"I'm close to accepting, but I'd like to get as close to $100 as possible. I'd be willing to pay $102.50 for the product. That's my final offer.",102.5,Bob,6,
