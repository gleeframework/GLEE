"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth at least $100 to me. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $120. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counteroffering with $135. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. I'm still trying to maximize my profit but also showing willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $125. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal for me and it avoids the risk of further negotiation and a potential lower offer. I'm happy to close the deal now."
