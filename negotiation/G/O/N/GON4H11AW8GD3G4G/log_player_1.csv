"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully maximize my earnings. I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me, so I'm not afraid to start high.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,800,000 is a good price, I believe I can do better. I'm confident the product is worth more than that to me, so I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,900,000. It's a compromise, but it still leaves me with a profit margin I'm comfortable with. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob into a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,750,000 is a good price, I'm still holding out for something closer to my initial asking price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a higher counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,850,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer but still higher than Bob's latest offer. I'm hoping this will show Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price and encourage him to come closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'm still hoping for a higher price, we are nearing the end of our negotiations, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. $1,700,000 is a good price and still a significant profit for me. I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
