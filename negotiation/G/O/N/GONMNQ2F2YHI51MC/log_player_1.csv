"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000.  This is a bold opening, but I believe it leaves room for negotiation while still securing a profit for myself. I'm hoping Bob recognizes the value of the product and is willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate a better price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a little higher.  I'm not yet ready to settle for less than $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this price is attractive enough for him to accept, but still allows me to secure a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'm confident that with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can get a better deal.  Selling to John would guarantee me my minimum, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm offering $1,025,000.  I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but still holding out for a bit more.  With only 5 rounds left, I need to make a decision soon about whether to accept a price closer to my minimum or risk losing the sale altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still going to reject it.  With only 4 rounds left, I'm getting more anxious about potentially losing the deal, but I believe I can still get a slightly higher price.  I'm also factoring in the risk of Bob getting frustrated and walking away from the negotiation.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

This is my final counteroffer.  I'm willing to meet Bob at his last offer of $990,000, but I'm adding a small amount to see if we can close the deal at my minimum.  I'm confident in the value of the product and I believe this offer is fair to both of us.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be forced to move on to John and sell for the guaranteed minimum."
