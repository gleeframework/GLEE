"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $7,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $7,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and quality.",7000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get the price down, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,000 and $6,500. I'm offering the product to you for $6,750. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value and quality.",6750.0,Alice,5,
