"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product,  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,000 is still a bit high for me, though.  Let's split the difference at $12,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
