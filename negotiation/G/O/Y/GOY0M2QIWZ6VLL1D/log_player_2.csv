"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above your target of saving as much money as possible. You have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product,  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming for a significant discount, but I'm still offering a price that's well above Alice's value for the product. This should encourage her to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to my target, I can still try to negotiate a lower price. I have several rounds remaining, so I'm not in a rush to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,000 is still a bit high for me, though.  Let's split the difference at $12,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's in the middle of our last two offers. This shows I'm serious about negotiating but also willing to be flexible. Hopefully, this will lead to a deal in the next round."
