"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000.  This price reflects the unique features and potential benefits of this product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money, and Alice's initial offer is at his maximum budget.  There's no incentive to accept immediately.  Rejecting and counter-offering gives Bob the opportunity to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, considering its unique features. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate.  How about $12500?  This price is fair considering the value I know this product can bring to you.  Let's work towards a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her original offer, which is good.  However, Bob still has room to negotiate further.  By rejecting the offer, he can continue to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250. This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
