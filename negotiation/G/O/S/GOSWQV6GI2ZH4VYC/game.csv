"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product, considering its unique features. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate.  How about $12500?  This price is fair considering the value I know this product can bring to you.  Let's work towards a mutually agreeable price.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11250. This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",11250.0,Bob,4,
