Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product, considering its unique features. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate.  How about $12,500?  This price is fair considering the value I know this product can bring to you.  Let's work towards a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11250. This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250.

Bob has offered $11,250, which is more than my minimum of $10,000 and close to my last counteroffer. I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
