"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation.  This shows I'm serious about a deal, but also open to compromise.  Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counter and see if we can find a compromise. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my offer to $1,300,000. This demonstrates flexibility while still keeping the price above my minimum. I'm optimistic this will lead to a quick agreement in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's not enough to make it worthwhile. I'll counter again and see if we can bridge the gap.  I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm going to split the difference with Bob's last offer and counter with $1,250,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still ensuring I get a price closer to my ideal.  If this doesn't work, I'll start seriously considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds remaining, I'm starting to run out of time.  Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to John's offer, and I'm not convinced I can get a better price from Bob in the remaining rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John to guarantee a sale.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a significant amount of money and avoids the risk of no sale at all."
