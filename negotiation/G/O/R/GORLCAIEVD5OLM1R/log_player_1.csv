Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,200,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my original asking price. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to still get a good return on my investment. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
