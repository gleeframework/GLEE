"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $165. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $165 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and I'll take it for $140.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go all the way down to $140, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you at $155. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you, and it's closer to my minimum price than $140.",155.0,Alice,5,
