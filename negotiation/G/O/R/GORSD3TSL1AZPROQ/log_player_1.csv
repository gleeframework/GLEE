Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $120.  I'll try to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $100 doesn't quite meet my needs, I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value."", ""product_price"": 110}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. Considering my budget constraints, could we possibly settle on $105 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $105 is getting closer to my target, I'm still holding out for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your flexibility. I'm still trying to get a little closer to my desired price. Would you consider $108? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great value for this amazing product."", ""product_price"": 108} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I'm glad we're making progress. Considering your last offer, would you be open to $107? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, I've been negotiating for a while, and it seems like we're close to an agreement. $107 is better than my minimum price of $120, and it seems like Bob is unlikely to offer more."
