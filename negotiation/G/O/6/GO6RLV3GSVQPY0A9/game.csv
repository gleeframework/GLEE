"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $2,200,000. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counter-offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest,  I can't go as low as $1,400,000. Would you consider $1,900,000? I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.  However, the value of this product to me is quite significant. I could consider letting it go for $1,800,000.  This is a firm offer, and I believe it reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1800000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your attachment to the product's value, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,750,000, but I think that's the absolute maximum I can stretch to. I hope you can meet me halfway and find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
