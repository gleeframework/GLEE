"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering its potential value to me and the potential savings I can offer you.  I'm eager to finalize this deal, so let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to lower the price to $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that meets your needs while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
