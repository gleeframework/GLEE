"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $8,000 to you. Let's see if we can close this deal quickly.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's work towards a solution that benefits both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product holds value for you, but I have a budget in mind. I could meet you halfway between our previous offers at $7,250. This feels like a fair compromise.",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $8,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to reach my target price while still giving you a good deal. Let's make this happen.",8000.0,Alice,5,
