Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell for that price yet.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with him."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is just too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Can you meet me at that price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

While $7,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for that price yet. I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6

Bob's offer is too low. I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm running out of time and I'm not confident I can get a better offer from him. It's better to sell to John now for $8,000 than to risk getting a lower price from Bob."
