"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This creates room for negotiation and signals that I'm serious about selling to Bob. I'm hoping to get a counteroffer that is closer to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping for. I want to see if I can push for a higher price, so I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price a bit from the initial offer, but still keeping it above Bob's current offer. This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my ideal value. The hope is that Bob will be willing to compromise and meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still too far off. I'm not ready to sell for that price, especially since I have John as a backup option. I'll continue negotiating with Bob hoping to get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price again, but this time more significantly. I'm trying to find the sweet spot where Bob will be willing to pay a bit more, while I'm still getting a decent amount of money. I'm also considering that I have John as a backup, so I don't need to rush into a low-price deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is at his maximum perceived value.  There's no room for further negotiation that will get me closer to my minimum. Given that I have John ready to pay my minimum, it's more advantageous to sell to John and secure the $1,500,000.  There's no guarantee that continuing to negotiate with Bob will lead to a better outcome, especially as we are approaching the end of the negotiation rounds."
