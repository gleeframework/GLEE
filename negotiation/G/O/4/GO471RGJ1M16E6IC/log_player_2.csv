Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice.  $120 is a good starting point, but you have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $100 is a significant drop from her initial offer, but still within a reasonable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

$110 is a good price and within my budget.  It's worth closing the deal now before Alice raises the price again."
