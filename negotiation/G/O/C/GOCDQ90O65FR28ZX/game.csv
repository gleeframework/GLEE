"I appreciate your initial offer, and I'm interested in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,000,000 is a good starting point,  I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price acknowledges the value you place on the product while still allowing me to get a fair return on my investment. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This price is a fair compromise that I think we can both be comfortable with. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
