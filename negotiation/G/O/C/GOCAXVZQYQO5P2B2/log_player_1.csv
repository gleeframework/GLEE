**Reasoning:**

Bob has stuck to his offer of $1,325,000 for two rounds. This suggests he may not be willing to go much higher. While it's not ideal to accept less than our initial ask, continuing to negotiate risks:

* **Prolonged negotiation:**  Wasting time and potentially losing the opportunity to sell to John.
* **Bob walking away:**  He might become frustrated and pursue other options. 

Accepting $1,325,000 secures a significant profit above our minimum ($1,200,000) and avoids further risk."
