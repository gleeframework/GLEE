Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer is based on the following reasoning:

* **My minimum value:** I value the product at $12,000, so I won't sell it for less.
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $12,000.
* **Potential profit:** By offering $15,000, I aim for a profit of $3,000 if Bob accepts.

**Rationale:**

This strategy balances risk and reward.  While $15,000 is a higher price than John's offer, it gives me a chance to maximize profit. If Bob rejects, I still have a guaranteed sale to John. The offer is high enough to tempt Bob, but not so high that it becomes unreasonable."
