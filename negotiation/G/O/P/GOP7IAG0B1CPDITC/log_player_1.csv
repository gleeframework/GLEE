Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** We start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than your guaranteed sale price to John ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value proposition"" and potential for ""significant returns,""  justifying the high price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone is positive and invites Bob to discuss.  This keeps the door open for him to counter-offer and potentially meet closer to your desired price.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, you have the security of selling to John for your minimum acceptable price. This strong alternative gives you leverage in the negotiation."
