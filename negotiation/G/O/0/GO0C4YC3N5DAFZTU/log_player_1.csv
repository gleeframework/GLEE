Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $15,000 on it. Would you consider lowering the price to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Explanation: Bob is firmly rooted at $10,000, which is our minimum acceptable price.  There's no guarantee further negotiation will yield a better result, and we risk losing the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
