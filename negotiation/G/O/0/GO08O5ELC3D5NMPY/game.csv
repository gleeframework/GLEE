"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find common ground and make this deal happen!",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose $1,180,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1180000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $1,180,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about $1,220,000?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. Let's seal the agreement!",1220000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still a bit short. How about $1,200,000? I'm willing to meet you at the price John is offering, but I'd rather buy from you if we can agree on a price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
