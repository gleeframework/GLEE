"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $115 is less than what John is selling for, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by counteroffering.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to drop her price closer to her own valuation of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110.  This is still a better deal than buying from John for $120.  Bob is getting the product for a price closer to his own valuation.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will get him a lower price, and the risk of losing the deal to John isn't worth it."
