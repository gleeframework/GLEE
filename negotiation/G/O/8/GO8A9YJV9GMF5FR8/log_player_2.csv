"Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $175 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $100.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can always buy from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $100. This is a strong opening counteroffer, as it clearly shows my limit and leaves room for potential negotiation. If Alice rejects, I can still buy from John for the same price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is within my budget and significantly lower than her initial offer. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and forcing me to buy from John at $100 makes accepting the current offer the most logical choice."
