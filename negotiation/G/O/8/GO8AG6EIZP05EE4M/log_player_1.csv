Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate. 
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  This gives you room to negotiate if Bob counters. 
* **It shows you're serious:** You're willing to make a reasonable offer first. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $10000 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($12,000).**  
* **There's still potential to negotiate with Bob.**  He's already shown interest and acknowledged the product's value.  

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum, but still appealing enough for him to consider."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in my product. While your offer is a bit low, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is higher than Bob's last offer, but still below my minimum.**  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **The message highlights the value for Bob.**  This reinforces his interest and might make him more likely to accept.

I'm aiming for a middle ground that's fair to both of us. Hopefully, Bob will agree to this counteroffer."
