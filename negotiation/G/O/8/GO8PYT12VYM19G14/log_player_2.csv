# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. What do you think?

While I'd love to try and squeeze out another few dollars, Alice is now offering the product for $110, which is still within my budget and a good deal considering my valuation of $150.  I'll accept her offer."
