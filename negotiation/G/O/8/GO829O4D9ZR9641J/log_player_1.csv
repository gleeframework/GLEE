"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant discount from its true value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from your desired price, but it's still a good profit for you. The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below what the product is worth to me. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit further. How about $950,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to sell for that low. I believe I can get a better deal if I continue negotiating.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. While $900,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still a bit short of my target. Let's meet in the middle at $925,000. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to make a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 925000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're aiming for $925,000, but I'm really pushing my budget at that point. Let's split the difference at $912,500. This is a fair price that's a reasonable compromise for both of us. I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $912,500 is tempting,  I'm not yet willing to settle for that price.  We're getting close, but I think I can still push for a slightly higher price. Let's see if I can get Bob to go a little higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and we're getting closer. How about $918,750? This is a small step up from your last offer and represents a significant compromise on my end. I believe this is a fair price for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 918750} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $918,750 is still pushing my budget. Let's aim for $910,000. It's a small compromise on my end, but it allows for a fair deal for both of us. We're very close to finalizing this, and I'm confident we can find common ground at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting very close to a deal with Bob, but with only two rounds left, I'm not confident I can push him any higher.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
