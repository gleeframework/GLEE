"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant discount from its true value. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.  What do you say?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit further. How about $950,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. While $900,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still a bit short of my target. Let's meet in the middle at $925,000. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to make a good deal. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're aiming for $925,000, but I'm really pushing my budget at that point. Let's split the difference at $912,500. This is a fair price that's a reasonable compromise for both of us. I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial. What do you think?",912500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and we're getting closer. How about $918,750? This is a small step up from your last offer and represents a significant compromise on my end. I believe this is a fair price for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this deal happen.",918750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $918,750 is still pushing my budget. Let's aim for $910,000. It's a small compromise on my end, but it allows for a fair deal for both of us. We're very close to finalizing this, and I'm confident we can find common ground at this price.",910000.0,Bob,8,
