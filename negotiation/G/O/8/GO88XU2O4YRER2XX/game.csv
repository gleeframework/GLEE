,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $130 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $125?  That's a reasonable price for a product that's worth $120 to me.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to compromise a bit more and offer it to you for $127. It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",127.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to go up to $126, but I can't go any higher.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to me.",126.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $126. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $128. It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",128.0,Alice,7,
