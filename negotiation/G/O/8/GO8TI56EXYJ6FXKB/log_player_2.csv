"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more to me than that, and you'll be getting it at a price that's significantly lower than what I'd get from someone else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is lower than her product's value to her, it's still higher than your maximum price and what John offers. By rejecting her offer, you can proceed to buy from John for $8,000, saving you $2,000."
