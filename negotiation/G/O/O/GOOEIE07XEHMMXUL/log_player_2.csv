"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $12,000 to you and I'm sure we can find a middle ground. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I will reject Alice's offer because it is higher than the maximum price I am willing to pay ($12,000). I will also reject the option to buy from John for $12,000, because I want to try to negotiate with Alice to get a better deal.
