"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While $900,000 is certainly appealing, the true value of this product is considerably higher.  I'd be willing to part with it for $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects its significant worth and offers you a fair deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
