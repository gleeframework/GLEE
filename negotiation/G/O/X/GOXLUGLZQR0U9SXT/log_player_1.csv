Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but it allows for some negotiation room.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a higher price increases the potential profit.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 provides a baseline and reduces the risk of selling too low. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** By offering a higher price, I leave space for negotiation.  Bob might be willing to pay closer to my asking price if he truly values the product.

**Important Note:** This is a high-risk strategy. Bob might reject the offer outright, and I would be forced to sell to John at the lower price.  However, it also offers the highest potential reward."
