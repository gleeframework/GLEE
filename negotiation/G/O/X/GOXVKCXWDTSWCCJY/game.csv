"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which still reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's make a deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  This would ensure both of us get a fair deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
