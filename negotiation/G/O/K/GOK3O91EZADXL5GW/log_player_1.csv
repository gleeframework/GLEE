``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $100. I'll try to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  It's still a great value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 95}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I would like to counter with a price of $92 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $92 is a good compromise and it's still above my minimum price of $80.  I'm confident I can make a better deal with another buyer in the future."
