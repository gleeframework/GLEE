I'm offering Bob the product for $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum of $800,000 with John.  

Here's my reasoning:

* **High Stakes:** I need to maximize my profit.  
* **Uncertainty:** I don't know Bob's valuation, so I'm taking a calculated risk.
* **Negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, I have a fallback with John, so I can afford to be a bit aggressive.  

I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
