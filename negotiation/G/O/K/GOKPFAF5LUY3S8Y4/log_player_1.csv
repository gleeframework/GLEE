Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price given its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage.**  This is important to build a positive relationship and increase the chances of a successful negotiation. 
* **I don't want to go too high initially.**  I want to leave myself room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers."
