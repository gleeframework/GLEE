{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a price of $119. I believe it would be a valuable addition for you, let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $100.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $120 provides a safety net. 

Offering the product at $119 aims to capture as much of the potential profit as possible while still making the deal attractive to Bob. It's a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price but significantly above Bob's perceived value."
