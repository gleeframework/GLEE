"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $2,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for it, reflecting its value to me while staying within my price range. Let me know what you think.",1700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher than your offer reflects. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,900,000. This takes into account its market potential and the unique benefits it offers.  What are your thoughts on this?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the product's value, $1,900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,800,000. This reflects a fair price for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
