Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm willing to make a special offer of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other potential buyers.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but below your guaranteed sale price ($1,500,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,300,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning other potential buyers adds a time pressure element, potentially encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a price that could be enticing compared to his perceived value."
