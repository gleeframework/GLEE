"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its market value, and I believe it's a fair offer.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000?  This would be a great deal for both of us, as it leaves room for profit for you and allows me to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we split the difference and agree on $11,000?  This would give you a solid profit, and I'd be able to get the product within my price range.  What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get the product within your budget, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,250. This is still a good compromise considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",11250.0,Alice,5,
