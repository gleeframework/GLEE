Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000?  This would be a great deal for both of us, as it leaves room for profit for you and allows me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we split the difference and agree on $11,000?  This would give you a solid profit, and I'd be able to get the product within my price range.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to get the product within your budget, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,250.
