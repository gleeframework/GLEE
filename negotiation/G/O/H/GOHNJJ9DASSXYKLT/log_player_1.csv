"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $110 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to leave some room for negotiation.  It's also important to start with a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the value of the item, but I am only able to pay up to $90 for it. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, but it's close enough that I want to see if I can get a bit more. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $90 is a good offer, I need to be closer to $100 to make this work.  Would you be willing to meet me at $95?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still a little below my minimum, but we're getting close.  Since I'm nearing the middle of the negotiation rounds, I think it's best to accept this offer and secure the sale.  It's better to have $92 than risk losing him and having to deal with John, who would only offer me $100."
