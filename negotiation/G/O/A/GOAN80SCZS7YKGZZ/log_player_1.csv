"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it.  This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see how much he's willing to pay. It's important to remember my goal is to maximize my profit, but also consider that John is a backup option at $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating.  I have a few rounds left, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping that Bob will see that I'm serious about getting a good price and will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm not willing to sell for anything less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating.  I still have several rounds left and I believe I can get a better price.  John is always an option, but I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's time to be firm. Bob has shown some willingness to negotiate, and with fewer rounds remaining, I need to push for a final price.  If he rejects this, I'll be prepared to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is getting close, but we're running out of time.  Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I'm concerned that he's not going to budge.  I don't want to risk losing out on the deal altogether, so I'm going to sell to John.  He's a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price, and it's better than risking another round with Bob."
