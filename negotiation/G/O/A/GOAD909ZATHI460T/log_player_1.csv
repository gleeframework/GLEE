Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of the product but still gives him room to negotiate. It also keeps me above my minimum price point.  If Bob rejects, I can adjust my price down a bit, but I'll always have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $9,500 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price point, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but higher than Bob's. This will show him I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate for a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,800. This is a great deal for both of us and allows me to meet my minimum price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9800} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to pay $9,600 for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial goal of $10,000, Bob's offer of $9,600 is a good compromise. It's just above my minimum price point of $12,000, and it seems like Bob is firm on that amount.  I don't want to risk losing this sale and having to settle for John's offer of $12,000."
