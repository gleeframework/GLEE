prompt,response
Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 because you have a guaranteed buyer (John).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he has a potential profit of $200,000 if he buys at your minimum.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000. 

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. A price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little room for Bob to see value, while a price too low means you leave money on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit your operations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You highlight the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's ""unique value proposition"" to create a sense of scarcity and desirability.
* **Confident Price:** $1,150,000 gives Bob a potential $50,000 profit, which is a strong incentive to buy. 
* **No Justification:** You don't need to justify the price immediately. This allows Bob to respond and potentially negotiate, giving you more information about his position.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation is Key:**  Be prepared to negotiate. Bob might counter-offer. Having a range in mind (e.g., willing to go down to $1,100,000) will help you.
* **Relationship Matters:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly lower price for long-term benefits."
