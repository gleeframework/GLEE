"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this unique product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, Alice.  How about we settle at $1,000,000? That's a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering your persistence and the value you see in the product, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
