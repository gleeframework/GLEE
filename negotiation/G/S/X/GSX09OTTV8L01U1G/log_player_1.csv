Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer.  I also have the option to sell to John for $150 at any point, providing a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $130 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's offer and my desired price.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still want to get a fair price.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $135 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to go lower, so I will sell the product to John for $150."
