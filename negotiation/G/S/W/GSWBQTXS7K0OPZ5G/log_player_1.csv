Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,750,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding Bob's value and getting closer to my minimum.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value in this product and hopefully come back with a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum. I'll reject his offer and see if we can find a more agreeable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm dropping the price slightly to $1,600,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still staying above Bob's valuation and closer to my minimum acceptable price. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still too low.  At this point, I'm confident that I can get a better price from John.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000.  This ensures I meet my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
