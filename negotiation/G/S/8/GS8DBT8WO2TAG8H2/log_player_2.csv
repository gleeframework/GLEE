"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a better price than John's offer, Bob can still potentially do better.  By rejecting, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum value of $120. This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but still potentially within a range where Alice might be willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is now within Bob's budget and a better price than John's offer. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there is no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower price, and the risk of losing the deal to another seller is present.  It's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
