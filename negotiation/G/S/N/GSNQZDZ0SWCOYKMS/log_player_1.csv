Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, but I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation Isn't Realistic:** In a real-world scenario, you wouldn't know Bob values the product at $8,000.  Your goal is to maximize your profit, so you start high.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high offer ($20,000), you set an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates down, the starting point influences his perception of the product's value.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. He might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if his offer is acceptable or if you're better off selling to John.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly lower initial offer. However, remember your primary goal is maximizing your profit."
