"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than what I could get elsewhere. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,100,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,150,000, which reflects a fair compromise.  This is a one-time opportunity for you to acquire a product worth much more to you. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,080,000? I'm willing to make a bit more of a concession, but I need to stay within my budget.",1080000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,080,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $1,115,000. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's close this deal!",1115000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you be willing to accept $1,092,500? I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I need to stay within my budget.",1092500.0,Bob,6,
