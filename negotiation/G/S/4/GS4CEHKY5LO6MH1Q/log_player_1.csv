"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This sets a high bar and gives me room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will either accept, or at least make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired value.  It's important to remember that I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round. While $1,500,000 from John is a guarantee, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired $2,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,800,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and come down from my initial price.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still need to earn more than $1,500,000. I'm going to reject his offer and keep pushing for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to drop my price again to $1,600,000. This is still above my minimum of $1,500,000 and John's offer, but it shows a commitment to negotiating and finding a compromise.  I hope this will finally convince Bob to come closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is now far below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more, I'm running out of time.  I've already made several concessions, and it's clear Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway. To avoid risking a further drop in the price, I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000. This guarantees me a profit, even if it's less than I initially hoped for."
