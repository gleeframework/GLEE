"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth. To be fair, let's meet in the middle. I propose $1,750,000.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, but $1,750,000 is still too high for my budget. I could consider going up to $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving on the price, but we need to find a number that works for both of us. Considering its value, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a very competitive offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This is my final offer as it's the highest I can go.  Let me know if it works for you.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
