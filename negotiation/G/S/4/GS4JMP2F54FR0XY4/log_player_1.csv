"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and potentially allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal later on. 
* **Justification:**  While the price is high, emphasizing the ""value"" and ""potential"" of the product might soften the initial shock for Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The language used suggests a willingness to find a price that works for both parties, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting now would mean a substantial loss for you. While selling to John is tempting, there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth. To be fair, let's meet in the middle. I propose $1,750,000."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection with Justification:**  Politely rejecting Bob's low offer while reiterating the product's value keeps the negotiation moving forward.
* **Compromise (Apparent):**  By suggesting a price that seems like a compromise (""meeting in the middle""), it might make Bob more receptive even though it's still heavily in your favor.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps the price point well above your minimum and provides room for further negotiation in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, but $1,750,000 is still too high for my budget. I could consider going up to $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob is increasing his offer, but at a slow pace. It's still significantly below your minimum. 
* **Alternative Option:** You have the security of John's offer, which provides leverage.
* **Time Constraint:**  With each round, the risk of Bob walking away increases. Holding firm for now maintains pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving on the price, but we need to find a number that works for both of us. Considering its value, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a very competitive offer."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** Recognizing Bob's movement keeps the negotiation positive, even if the increment is small.
* **Significant Drop, Justification:**  Dropping the price by $150,000 demonstrates flexibility but needs to be framed as a substantial concession to emphasize its appeal. 
* **Limited Time Implication:** Using language like ""competitive offer"" subtly introduces a sense of urgency without resorting to direct threats."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This is my final offer as it's the highest I can go.  Let me know if it works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob has explicitly stated this is his highest bid.  
* **Reaching Bob's Limit:**  His offer of $1,200,000 aligns with his perceived value of the product, indicating he's unlikely to go higher.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees a larger profit with no further negotiation risk. 

While continuing could potentially squeeze out a bit more from Bob, it's risky. It's better to secure a guaranteed, favorable deal with John than to gamble on Bob potentially walking away."
