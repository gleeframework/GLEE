Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strong Starting Point:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($14,000) allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Clear Communication:**  Being upfront that this is a one-time offer prevents Bob from countering with lowball amounts.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know the product's value to Bob, he might not be willing to pay his maximum. 
* **Risk Tolerance:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer, and you'll make $10,000 from John instead of a potential $14,000. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still being realistic about the negotiation."
