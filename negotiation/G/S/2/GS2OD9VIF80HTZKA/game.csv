"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is unfortunately outside of my budget.  Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While the product is very valuable, I'm willing to come down a bit to reach a deal. How about we settle on $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,150,000.  This would allow us both to walk away with a fair deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
