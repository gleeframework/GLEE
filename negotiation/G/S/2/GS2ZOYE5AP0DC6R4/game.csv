"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I believe will be a valuable asset to your business.  I've priced it at $1,000,000, reflecting its high quality and potential for growth.  Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, considering its value to me and the potential for future growth. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $950,000 is getting closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $925,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me and allows us to move forward with a mutually beneficial transaction.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $925,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's compromise again.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $937,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to secure a profitable outcome.",937500.0,Alice,5,
