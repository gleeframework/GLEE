Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. I've carefully considered its worth and, given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $925,000. I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us, especially considering its potential value to you."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($800,000) but still leaving room for negotiation if needed. This maximizes potential profit if Bob accepts.
* **Highlighting Value:** My message emphasizes the product's value to Bob ($1,000,000), subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** The offered price of $925,000 allows Bob to potentially negotiate down while still netting me a significant profit. If Bob counter-offers, I have room to negotiate down towards $850,000 while still exceeding my fallback offer from John.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
