"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering my budget and the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I believe this price is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm ready to pay $9,500 for the product, which is a significant step up from my previous offer. This price reflects the value I place on the product, while staying within my financial constraints. I hope you'll consider this offer as a fair and mutually beneficial solution.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. While $10,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to offer $9,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, while still allowing me to stay within my financial constraints. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",9750.0,Bob,6,
