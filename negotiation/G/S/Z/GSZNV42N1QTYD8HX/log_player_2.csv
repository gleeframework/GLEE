"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1500000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a significant discount and a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is a better deal:** Even though the product is worth $1,500,000 to you, Alice is selling it for $1,200,000, which is a significant saving of $300,000. 
* **John's price is too high:** While you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, John's price matches your maximum, leaving you no room for negotiation or profit.

Accepting Alice's offer saves you money and allows you to acquire the product at a lower price."
