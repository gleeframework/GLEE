"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which still gives you a good value.  Let's meet in the middle.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit. How about we settle at $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $7,000 still doesn't quite work for me.  How about $7,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and I think it reflects the value of this product.",7500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting close to my limit.  Would you be willing to do $7,200? That's the best I can offer.",7200.0,Bob,6,
