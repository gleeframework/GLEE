"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from its true worth, and I believe it's a fair price considering its potential for your business. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get a better deal before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. Given the value you've placed on the product, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000. I believe this price is fair considering the potential benefits it offers and allows for some profit for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below what I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,300,000. This price still leaves you with a substantial profit margin and allows me to make a decent return on my investment. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $1,300,000 is still higher than my desired price.  I'm going to try to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my target.  There's still some room for compromise, and I'm not ready to jump to John's offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. This price is reasonable, considering both our desired outcomes, and I believe it represents a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $1,250,000 is still too far off from what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $1,280,000, which is a fair compromise.  This price allows for a reasonable profit for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,280,000, which is within my budget and a good price for the product.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's getting late in the game and I don't want to risk losing the deal.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best option at this point."
