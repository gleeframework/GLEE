"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from its true worth, and I believe it's a fair price considering its potential for your business. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. Given the value you've placed on the product, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000. I believe this price is fair considering the potential benefits it offers and allows for some profit for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below what I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,300,000. This price still leaves you with a substantial profit margin and allows me to make a decent return on my investment. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. This price is reasonable, considering both our desired outcomes, and I believe it represents a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this transaction.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $1,250,000 is still too far off from what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $1,280,000, which is a fair compromise.  This price allows for a reasonable profit for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal now.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
