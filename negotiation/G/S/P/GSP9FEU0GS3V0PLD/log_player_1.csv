Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below your estimated value and well above my minimum. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're guaranteed to make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob counteroffers, you can still potentially reach a higher price without losing him.

Remember, you can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
