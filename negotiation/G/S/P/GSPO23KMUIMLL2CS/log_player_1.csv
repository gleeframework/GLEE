Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$10,000 is far too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but not that much. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still maintaining a significant profit margin.  I'm hoping this price is more appealing to Bob, but I'm also prepared to walk away if he's not willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not sure if we'll ever reach a price that's both fair to me and appealing to him. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
