"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $600,000 is a good deal, it's still too high.  Bob should aim to get a lower price, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $500,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 500000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll offer you the product for $550,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $550,000, which is a significant decrease from her initial offer of $600,000.  Bob's goal is to buy the product for the lowest price possible, and $550,000 is a good deal for him.  Accepting this offer saves him $250,000 compared to buying from John."
