"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not quite ready to settle at $800,000, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I've already made a significant concession. I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $825,000, so I'll offer it to you for $837,500. This is my final offer. What do you think?",837500.0,Alice,7,
