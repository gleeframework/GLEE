Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I've already made a significant concession. I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $825,000, so I'll offer it to you for $837,500. This is my final offer. What do you think?

This is a good deal for Bob.  Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and continuing to negotiate could frustrate her and risk losing the deal.  While Bob could push for a slightly lower price, accepting the $837,500 offer ensures he gets the product at a significant discount from his maximum budget."
