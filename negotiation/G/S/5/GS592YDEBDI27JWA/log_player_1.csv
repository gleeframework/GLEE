Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. That price is quite high for me at the moment. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the value this product will bring you."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value this product brings, but $1,900,000 is still too high for my budget.  I can go up to $750,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob is still very far below a reasonable offer.  We have time to negotiate and John is our backup plan."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're not quite aligned on the value here.  $750,000 is simply too low for what this product offers. I'm willing to consider $1,600,000, but that's my absolute best."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However,  $1,600,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable paying.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable range, we're still leaving a significant amount of money on the table. We're willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of undervaluing the product. Let's see if we can bring him up a bit further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial price.  To be frank, $1,200,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, but I'm willing to accept $1,400,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the product's value."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close!  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $1,300,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we could push for more, accepting Bob's offer at $1,300,000 is a strategic decision. Here's why:

* **Strong Return:** We're still securing a significant profit above Bob's perceived value of $800,000. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations and potential for Bob to back out. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
* **Relationship Building:**  Accepting a compromise can foster goodwill for future dealings. 

While selling to John would net an extra $200,000, the certainty and speed of closing the deal with Bob at this favorable price outweigh the potential upside."
