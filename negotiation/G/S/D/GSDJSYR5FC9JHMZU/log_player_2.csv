{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This establishes a starting point for negotiation and demonstrates Bob's seriousness about saving money.  He's aiming for a price well within his budget, but still leaving room for potential negotiation."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price point.  Bob has several rounds left, and there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it below his maximum budget. This shows that he's willing to compromise but is also determined to get the best possible price.  The goal is to gradually close the gap between their offers and hopefully reach an agreement within the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget, and there's a good chance that further negotiation will be difficult.  While Bob would prefer a lower price, the risk of going back and forth further and potentially losing the deal altogether is too high. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product while still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John."
