"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's offer:**  $1,000,000 is less than $1,200,000.
* **There's room for negotiation:** You can likely get a better price than $1,000,000.  Since Alice values the product at $800,000, there's a potential for both of you to find a price that's beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping for something closer to my initial offer.  Let's split the difference and go with $950,000. This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** $950,000 is significantly less than $1,200,000.
* **A good compromise:**  Alice is willing to meet you halfway, which shows a willingness to negotiate. While you could try for a lower price, there's a chance she'll dig in and you might end up paying more. 
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could prolong the process, and it's possible you might end up paying more in the end."
