"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the unique qualities of this product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $15,500? This is a good compromise and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go below $16,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, so I'm offering $16,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",16250.0,Alice,5,
