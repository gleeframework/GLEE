"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  You can likely get a better price by negotiating. It's also worth noting that you have a fallback option with John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  Given the value you place on the product, I'd be willing to pay $900,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to the value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value you've placed on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my ideal price. It's too early to accept, as I have some room to negotiate further and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value you placed on the product and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go much lower than that. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I think $1,025,000 is the lowest I can go. This is a price that I think is still reasonable, considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price.  I have some room to negotiate further without needing to resort to buying from John. I'll continue to try and get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,025,000 is still slightly higher than I'd like to go. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement if we meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to offer $975,000 for the product. This price is a fair compromise that takes into account both our desired outcomes."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $985,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still slightly higher than my ideal price, it's getting very close and it's clear that she's not willing to go much lower.  With only 3 rounds left, it's a good time to accept the offer and avoid risking a failed negotiation.  I'm still saving a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
