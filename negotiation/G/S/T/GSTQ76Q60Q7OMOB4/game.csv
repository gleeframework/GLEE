"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,500 is a good offer, I'm still a bit away from my target price.  I'd be willing to come down to $11,500, which reflects the value of the product and also allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,3,
