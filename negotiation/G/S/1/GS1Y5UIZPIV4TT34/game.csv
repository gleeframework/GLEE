"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that $950,000 might be a stretch, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me. I think it's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits it can bring to your business.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $825,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. How about $760,000? That's a significant step from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about closing this deal.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get closer to the price you're comfortable with, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $760,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
