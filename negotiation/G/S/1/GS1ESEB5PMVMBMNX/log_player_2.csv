"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth no more than $100 to Bob.
* Alice's initial offer of $150 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum value.
* It's better to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm!  However, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $75 at this time. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but it shows Bob is still interested. It's a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** A $75 counteroffer allows for potential compromise without immediately hitting Bob's maximum value of $100.
* **Keeps the negotiation going:**  This counteroffer keeps the ball in Alice's court and allows Bob to see if she's willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $75 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $125. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice has lowered her price, $125 is still above Bob's maximum value of $100. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and try to push the price lower. 
* **John's offer:**  Bob has a backup option of buying from John for $100, giving him leverage during the negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $125 is still a bit higher than I can go.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $95.  I'm really hoping to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pushing the limit:** This counteroffer is closer to Bob's maximum value of $100, but still leaves room for a potential compromise.
* **Demonstrating willingness:**  The message emphasizes Bob's desire to make a deal, making Alice more likely to accept.
* **Avoiding John's offer:**  By pushing closer to $100, Bob increases the chance of closing a deal with Alice before resorting to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession. I'll sell the product to you for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above value:** $115 is still above Bob's maximum value of $100.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Bob has a guaranteed alternative for $100, so there's no need to rush into a deal.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and might push Alice to make a more acceptable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you getting closer to my price point. However, $115 is still a bit more than I can afford at this time.  If you're willing to come down to $105, I'm ready to make this deal happen.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pushing for a compromise:**  $105 is a significant step closer to Bob's maximum value of $100 but leaves room for a potential deal with Alice.
* **Staying above John's offer:** This counteroffer keeps Bob in a better negotiating position than simply accepting John's offer.
* **Expressing urgency:**  The message conveys a sense of finality, potentially motivating Alice to make a final concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your price point, Bob! I'll make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** $110 is still above Bob's maximum value of $100.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  Bob has a guaranteed alternative to buy the product for $100, which is lower than Alice's offer.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only three rounds left, it's unlikely Alice will come down to a price Bob is willing to accept.

It's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product at his desired price from John rather than risk a further negotiation with Alice that might not result in a favorable outcome."
