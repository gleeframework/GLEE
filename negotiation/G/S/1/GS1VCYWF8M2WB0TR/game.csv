"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $725,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment.",725000.0,Alice,3,
