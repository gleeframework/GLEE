"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. This is a one-time offer, so don't miss out!",130.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $125? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $135 is still a little too high for me. How about $130? I think that's a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $135 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $130. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $135 and $130, which is $132.50. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",132.5,Alice,5,
