"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. This is a one-time offer, so don't miss out! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are willing to pay $150 for the product, and Alice is willing to sell for $120. There is room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $125? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $135 is still higher than my ideal price. I'm willing to pay $150, so there's still room for negotiation. I'll make another counteroffer to try and find a price we both can agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $135 is still a little too high for me. How about $130? I think that's a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $135 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $130. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $135 and $130, which is $132.50. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $132.50 is still slightly higher than my ideal price, but it's close enough to my upper limit of $150 that it's worth accepting.  It's better than buying from John and saving me $17.50."
