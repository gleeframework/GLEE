"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's estimated value ($12,000). This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Showing Confidence:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to see it as a worthwhile investment.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message indicates that I'm open to negotiation, which might make Bob more likely to counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a price close to my lower limit ($15,000), I aim to start the negotiation favorably. I'm also leaving room for several rounds of negotiation while still aiming for a price as close to my minimum as possible. I'm also keeping the option of selling to John as a backup, if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation. I can offer a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price and potentially reach a mutually acceptable deal.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the door open for a higher counteroffer from him in the next round.

**Strategy:**

I want to maintain my negotiating power and avoid settling for a price too far below my minimum. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob, but I'm also keeping the option of selling to John as a safety net if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $12,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that's closer to his proposed price but still above my minimum. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Value-Based Justification:** I'm framing my counteroffer in terms of the product's value, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm ending the message with a question, encouraging Bob to respond and keep the negotiation moving forward. 

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground that allows me to secure a higher price than Bob's initial counteroffer while staying within a reasonable range. I'm confident that this counteroffer will encourage Bob to counter again, moving us closer to a deal. If he doesn't counter, I still have the option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  How about $13,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is only $2,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 6 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers.
* **Good Chance of a Deal:** Bob's message expresses confidence in closing the deal, indicating a willingness to compromise.

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and maximizes my potential earnings in the limited time available. The risk of further negotiation could lead to a lower price or a failed deal, making accepting Bob's offer the most sensible choice at this stage."
