"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than $15,000, Bob can likely do better.  He knows he can get the product for $12,000 from John, so he's going to try to negotiate with Alice to get closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's closer to his target price of $12,000. He's also trying to be polite and positive, emphasizing finding a compromise. This should encourage Alice to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $12,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $12,000.  While Alice has come down, $13,500 is still a bit more than Bob wants to pay.  He's willing to keep negotiating to see if he can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  How about $13,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to try and find a middle ground with Alice.  He's offering $13,000, which is halfway between his previous offer and Alice's offer.  This shows that he is serious about closing a deal and is willing to be flexible."
