{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,200,000) to maximize our profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While we could start higher, asking for Bob's full valuation might make him less likely to accept, even if he values the product that highly.
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $1,100,000 or a bit lower still represents a substantial profit over our minimum acceptable price ($800,000). 

This strategy balances ambition with a realistic chance of securing a deal that's significantly beneficial for us."
