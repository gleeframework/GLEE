Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning he would theoretically be willing to pay anything up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so any offer to Bob should be significantly higher. 
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a strong offer of $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a substantial profit above your minimum. It also anchors the negotiation closer to Bob's valuation. 
* **Open Communication:** The message encourages a dialogue, allowing Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high."
