{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's in great condition and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed, but it's also a price that I feel is fair considering my minimum value of $80. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to pay that price for it. Can you meet me at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I want to see if I can get a bit closer to my initial asking price. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $80 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90? That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to pay that price for it. Can you meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum price, and I'm confident I won't get a better offer. It's a good deal for both of us, so I'll accept it."
