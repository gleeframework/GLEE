"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  I understand it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire this product at a price that's below its true value to me.  Please let me know your decision. If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for a higher amount.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
