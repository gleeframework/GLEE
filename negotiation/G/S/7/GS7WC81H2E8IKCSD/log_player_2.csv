"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product, and I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of her coming back with a lower price, closer to her $10,000 value. It's worth seeing if you can save an additional $500."
