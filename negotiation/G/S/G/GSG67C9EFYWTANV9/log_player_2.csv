# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a better deal from Alice before resorting to John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit on the price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my desired price, $1,250,000 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. It's worth continuing the negotiation and seeing if we can reach a price that works for both of us."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000, which is still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is being stubborn and hasn't budged much from her initial offer. We've been going back and forth, and it seems unlikely she'll come down to a price I'm comfortable with.  I've already reached my maximum limit, and it's not worth risking further negotiation that could potentially go on for a long time. I'd rather secure the product from John at $1,500,000, even if it's a higher price, to avoid any further delays."
