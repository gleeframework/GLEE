"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95. Let's see if we can find common ground.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've already invested a lot in this product, and $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $110. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm happy to pay $100 for it. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's fair for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $105. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",105.0,Alice,5,
