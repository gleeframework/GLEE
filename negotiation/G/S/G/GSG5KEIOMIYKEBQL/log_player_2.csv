"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible and the product is worth $80 to you, accepting Alice's offer of $120 is not ideal.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price.  You can always buy from John for $80 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer sets the price at your maximum value for the product. Since Alice values the product at $150, there's a good chance she'll find this counteroffer attractive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is closer to your maximum value, it's still above what you are willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as you still have several rounds left. You can always buy from John as a backup if the negotiations with Alice fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between your previous offer of $80 and Alice's offer of $100. It shows you are willing to meet her halfway, which could increase the chance of reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is a good price, it's still slightly above your ideal price point. Since you have several rounds remaining and John is always a viable option, it makes sense to keep negotiating to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 92} 
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is another compromise, offering a price slightly higher than your previous offer, but still below Alice's latest offer.  It shows continued willingness to meet halfway, and with few rounds remaining, might encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $93 is very close to your ideal price point, and with only three rounds remaining, it's a good deal.  You're likely to save more by accepting than by continuing to negotiate.  If you continue and Alice rejects your counteroffer, you might be forced to buy from John for $80, which is more than Alice's current offer."
