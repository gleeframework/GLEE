"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $950,000. This leaves a good margin for negotiation while still ensuring I get a significant portion of the value Bob sees in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is my minimum, it's worth trying to push for a better price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $900,000. This shows flexibility while still leaving some room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is a good compromise. While I would prefer more, it's a significant increase from his initial offer and still above my minimum.  I'll accept and close the deal."
