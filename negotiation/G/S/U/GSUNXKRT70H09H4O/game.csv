"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint. Can we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,300,000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit away from my desired price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1,300,000 to $1,350,000, so I'd like to offer $1,325,000. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,340,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1340000.0,Alice,5,
