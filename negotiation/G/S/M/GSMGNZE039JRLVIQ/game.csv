"I appreciate the enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1050000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a more substantial offer of $950000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious investment at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to meet you in the middle. I'm offering a price of $1025000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to discussing the details of the sale.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I've made a serious offer of $950000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm starting to lose interest in continuing the negotiation. I'd like to reiterate that I'm willing to walk away and buy the product from John for $1000000 if we can't come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,
