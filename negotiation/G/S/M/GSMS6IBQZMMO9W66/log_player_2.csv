"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $95 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is within your budget, it's not the best deal. You can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the initial offer allows you to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a really great product, and I think it's worth it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $90, which is still within your budget and closer to your desired price. While you could continue negotiating, there's a chance she'll refuse to go lower or the negotiation could drag on. Accepting the offer at $90 secures the product at a reasonable price without risking the potential for a drawn-out negotiation or the need to buy from John at a higher price."
