"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly special. My initial price is $1,700,000, reflecting its high quality and potential value to you. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price, so let's discuss further.",1700000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,700,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,400,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still leaves room for negotiation, but it's a fair starting point. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum. This reflects the value of the product to me and would allow for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's finalize this deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
