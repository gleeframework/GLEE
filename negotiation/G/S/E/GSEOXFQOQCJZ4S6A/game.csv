"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but let's meet in the middle.  My counteroffer is $850,000. This is a fair price considering the immense value this product brings to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you have a bottom line, but so do I.  Let's settle this at $750,000 and call it a deal?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  While $750,000 is still a bit low, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference at $800,000? This price would ensure a win-win situation for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,5,
