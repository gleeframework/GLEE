"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I understand its worth to you is significant, and I'm confident we can arrive at a mutually beneficial agreement.  My minimum acceptable price is $800,000, but I'm willing to negotiate.  Would you be interested in discussing a price of $1,200,000 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice wants to sell above her product's value of $800,000.
* **Your Limit:** You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Power:** You have leverage because you have an alternative (buying from John).

Alice's opening offer of $1,200,000 leaves room for negotiation. By rejecting, you signal that you're looking for a price closer to your limit. Alice might come back with a lower offer to avoid losing the sale."
