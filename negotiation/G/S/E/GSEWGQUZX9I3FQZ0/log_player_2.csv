"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to consider this unique item.  However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000? "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. A $2,000 reduction is a substantial step towards his goal of getting the product for under $15,000. This counteroffer also shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is willing to walk away if the price is not right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I can meet you halfway at $11000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price lower than $11,000.  Rejecting this offer allows him to make a counteroffer and continue negotiating, potentially getting closer to his ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to keep the price below $11,000. This counteroffer shows that he is willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.  By offering $10,500, he is only $500 away from Alice's last offer, suggesting that he is serious about closing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to go up to $10500, Bob. I'm willing to meet you there, but I need to make a profit. I can do $10800. Is that something you'd be comfortable with? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,800 is within Bob's budget and is significantly lower than John's price of $15,000.  At this point,  Bob has successfully negotiated a good price and there is no reason to risk going another round and potentially losing the deal."
