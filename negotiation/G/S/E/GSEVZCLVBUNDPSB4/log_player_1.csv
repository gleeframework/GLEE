Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential of this product,  $1500000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000.

This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
