"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its potential. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1500000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential of this product,  $1500000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1250000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
