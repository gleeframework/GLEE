"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12000 is tempting, it's unfortunately below what I can accept at this time.  How about we meet in the middle at $14500?  It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target.",14500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $13500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference again and go with $14000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $13000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $13500.  Let's meet at $13750. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",13750.0,Alice,7,
