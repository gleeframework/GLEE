"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really value. My asking price is $140, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is within your budget, it's still higher than what the product is worth to you ($150). It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price, especially since Alice is open to negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $130? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
