"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $800,000 is significantly below the value you've stated.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm offering $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to get a decent return on my investment.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still allows you to get a good return on your investment, while also being more in line with my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,
