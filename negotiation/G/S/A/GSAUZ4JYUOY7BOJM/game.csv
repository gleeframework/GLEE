"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd like to offer you $12,500 for it.  What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While that's a fair price, the product's value to me is a bit higher. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be though.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
