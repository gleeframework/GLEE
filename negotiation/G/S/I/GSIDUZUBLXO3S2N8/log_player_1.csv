Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I think it's worth the price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation and gives me a decent profit. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product while leaving room for Bob to negotiate. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer is designed to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If he rejects the offer outright, it's likely that he's not serious about buying the product.
* **Open the negotiation:**  If he counteroffers, it gives me a chance to assess his willingness to pay and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* **Keep John as a backup:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away from the negotiation if it doesn't benefit me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's also well below my initial offer, indicating he's not willing to negotiate seriously.  

**Strategy:**

By rejecting his offer, I'm signaling that I'm not desperate for a sale and that I'm willing to continue negotiating. This puts pressure on Bob to raise his offer, as he knows I have other options.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm countering with $9,000, which is a compromise but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at an unreasonable price.
* **Message:** I'm reiterating the value of the product and emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect, encouraging Bob to consider my counteroffer. 
* **Leaving the door open:** I'm not making a hard ""take it or leave it"" statement. I'm giving Bob space to negotiate further, but also subtly indicating that I might not be willing to go much lower.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Move the negotiation closer to my desired price:** While $9,000 is still below my minimum, it's a significant step up from Bob's offer.
* **Maintain my leverage:**  I'm not giving in to Bob's lowball offer, but I'm also not shutting down the negotiation completely.
* **Test Bob's commitment:**  If he's truly interested, he'll likely counter with a higher offer. If he rejects, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $6,000 is too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $7,500 is a slight improvement, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than what it's worth to me.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting his offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm not willing to settle for a price that is significantly lower than my minimum. This keeps pressure on Bob to increase his offer or risk losing the deal. I will counter with a price closer to my desired value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $7,500, but that's still not quite there for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need $10,000 to make this work. It's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering with $10,000, which is a further compromise but still above my minimum and significantly higher than Bob's latest offer.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging his effort to increase his offer while maintaining my stance.  I'm using ""meet you in the middle"" to sound like a compromise while actually moving closer to my desired price. I'm also reminding him of the product's value.
* **Open to further negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for a final round of bargaining, suggesting that I'm willing to continue negotiating if he's serious about buying.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Increase the pressure on Bob:**  I'm clearly not willing to go any lower, but I'm not shutting down the negotiation.
* **Position myself for a final, potentially successful negotiation:**  $10,000 is a good compromise point that could potentially be acceptable to both parties.
* **Maintain the leverage of John's offer:** I'm still holding onto the option of selling to John for $15,000 if the negotiation doesn't work out."
