"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a truly unique product I believe you'd find highly valuable. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1500000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth exploring if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1,500,000 is more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to pay up to $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  This represents a significant compromise on my side, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than my ideal price point, but it's getting closer. I'm not ready to accept yet, but I'll see if I can push for a slightly lower price.  It's worth seeing if we can get a bit closer to my target of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. $1,250,000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still hoping to get it for $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise, as it's halfway between your last offer and my previous one. Let's see if we can make it work."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate that.  I'm willing to come down to $1150000.  This is a small step down from my last offer, and I think it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to my target price, and we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  While I could try to get a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and I'll have to pay Jhon $1,200,000.  Accepting Alice's offer at $1,150,000 is the best option in this scenario."
