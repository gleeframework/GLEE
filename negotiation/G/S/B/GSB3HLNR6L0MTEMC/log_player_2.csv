"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $10,000 by both parties. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it would be beneficial for you to own it. My initial offer for this exceptional item is $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Reason:While Alice's offer is good, there's room for negotiation. Bob's goal is to save as much as possible. By rejecting and counter-offering, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $8,000?"",

}
```"

Round 3

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reason: Alice is coming down, which is good. However, there's still a significant gap between her counteroffer ($8,500) and Bob's previous offer ($8,000).  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if a compromise can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?"",

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reason: Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but it's a slow negotiation.  We're getting close to a price where Bob should consider accepting, but there's still room to push a little further down before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're clearly invested in finding a fair deal, and I respect that.  To avoid dragging this out further, I'd be willing to close at $8,200. This saves us both time and gets the product in my hands."",

}
```"

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reason: Alice has met Bob in the middle from his previous offer. This price is a significant savings from both the initial offer and John's price. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a substantially better outcome, and it risks alienating Alice."
