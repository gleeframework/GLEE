{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135. It's a great deal for a product worth more than $150 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $150 but understand it might be too high for Bob. By offering a price slightly lower than my minimum, I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate and hopefully encourage Bob to engage in a back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. While $125 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum of $150.  I can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $132.50? That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 132.50}
```

I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's counteroffer, but still lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also highlights the value of the product for me.  I hope this encourages Bob to accept my offer, but I'm prepared to continue the negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $128? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, I'm happy to accept Bob's offer of $128. It's a good compromise, and it's still above my minimum threshold of $150. Continuing to negotiate might result in a higher price, but it also risks losing the deal entirely. 

I'm confident I can still turn a profit, even at this price point, and I'm not willing to risk the potential loss by continuing the negotiation."
