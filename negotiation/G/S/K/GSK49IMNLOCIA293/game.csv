"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your initial offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. Could you consider something closer to $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While $13,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000.  Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $7,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit and offer you $7,500.  I think that's a fair price, considering it's already a good deal for you at $12,000. What do you say?",7500.0,Bob,6,
