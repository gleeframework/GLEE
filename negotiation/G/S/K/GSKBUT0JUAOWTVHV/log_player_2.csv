Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to make a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000.

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000.  This is a good sign, but I'm still hoping to get a lower price.  I will reject her offer and make another counteroffer.  It's possible that I can get to a price point that's closer to my target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While $1,075,000 is still above my target of $1,000,000, it's close enough.  Continuing to negotiate could drag things out, and I'm not sure how much lower Alice will go.  It's worth accepting the offer and saving $425,000 compared to buying from John."
