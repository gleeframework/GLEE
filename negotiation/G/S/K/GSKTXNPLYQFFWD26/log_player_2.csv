"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still possible to negotiate further and potentially get an even better deal.  There's no information about Alice's minimum acceptable price, so rejecting and making a counteroffer allows for more exploration."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while also giving Alice room to counter with a price that is still beneficial to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, but I believe I can still get a better deal. By rejecting and making a counteroffer, I can continue to pressure Alice and potentially get a price closer to my $1,000,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a lower price. This counteroffer is a reasonable middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer, and it might be enough to secure a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer is only $25,000 higher than my last counteroffer. It's unlikely I'll be able to get a significantly lower price with further negotiation.  At this point, it's more beneficial to accept and secure the product for a price that is still within my budget and a significant saving compared to buying from John."
