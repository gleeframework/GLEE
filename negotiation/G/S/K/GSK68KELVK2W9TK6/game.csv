"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original offer. How about we split the difference and go with $1,000,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going up to $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers. How about we go with $950,000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
