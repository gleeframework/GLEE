"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100 to make this work. This is a really great product, and I think you'll agree that it's worth the investment. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $100, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $95. Can we do that?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer of $95, but I'm still unable to go that low.  $100 is my final offer.  It's a fair price for a product of this quality. If you're not able to meet that, I'll have to move on. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
