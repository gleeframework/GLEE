Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $80, so $110 gives him some room to negotiate but still allows for profit for you. 
* **It's below your minimum:** You won't sell for less than $120, but this offer leaves room for you to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  It avoids ambiguity and focuses on the value proposition.

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $90 is above his perceived value, it's below your minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **You have a better option:** You can sell to John for $120, which is significantly more profitable than accepting Bob's offer. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to your desired range. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you show that you're firm on your price and open to negotiating a fair deal. This will encourage Bob to make a higher counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100 to make this work. This is a really great product, and I think you'll agree that it's worth the investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet Bob halfway:** $100 is a compromise that shows you're willing to negotiate, but still gives you a decent profit.
* **Highlight the value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's quality reinforces the value proposition and might make him more willing to pay a bit more.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** Keeping the conversation friendly increases the chances of a successful deal. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and incentivize Bob to accept while still protecting your interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $100, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $95. Can we do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $95 is closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Selling to John is more profitable:**  You can sell the product to John for $120, which guarantees a higher profit than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation may be futile:**  Bob is already showing resistance to moving closer to your desired price. Further negotiation may not yield a better outcome. 

This decision is about maximizing your profit. While it's tempting to try and push for a better deal with Bob, selling to John guarantees a higher return and minimizes the risk of prolonged negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer of $95, but I'm still unable to go that low.  $100 is my final offer.  It's a fair price for a product of this quality. If you're not able to meet that, I'll have to move on. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  This clarifies that you're not willing to go lower. 
* **Reiterate value:** Reminding Bob of the product's quality reinforces its worth and puts pressure on him to close the deal. 
* **Show willingness to walk away:**  This adds a sense of urgency and motivates Bob to accept your offer. 

This counteroffer is a final attempt to reach a deal with Bob at a price closer to your desired range. If he still rejects, you'll be ready to sell to John and secure a guaranteed profit."
