"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, as it's well above your value for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,300,000? This still leaves you a significant profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
