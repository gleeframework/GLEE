# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11500. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Buying from Alice for $11,500 is cheaper than buying from John for $12,000. Even though Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her, it's still a good deal for Bob."
