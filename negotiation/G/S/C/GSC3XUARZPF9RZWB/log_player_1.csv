Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and avoids immediate rejection.
* **Showing Flexibility:** My message expresses willingness to negotiate and considers Bob's perspective.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,200,000 gives me leverage to hold out for a higher price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it demonstrates his interest. This allows for further negotiation to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Leveraging John:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,200,000 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $900,000 is below my ideal price, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to facilitate this deal. This price still reflects the value of the product for you, and it allows for a fair margin for me. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering a price that is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing that the price is still beneficial for him.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  While I'm offering a compromise, I'm not giving in completely.  I'm keeping the price above my minimum threshold, as I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, my budget is closer to $950,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Continues:**  Bob's offer shows he's willing to negotiate further. It's worth trying to bridge the gap for a slightly better price.
* **John's Offer Remains:**  I can still sell to John for a higher price if this negotiation fails. This gives me the security to continue bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  To make this work, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000.  This is a significant concession on my end, but it reflects my desire to reach a deal with you.  Let's find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm offering my absolute minimum price, which is still above Bob's offer but below my initial asking price.  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while protecting my interests.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize the win-win aspect of the deal, suggesting that we can both benefit from reaching an agreement.
* **Setting a Deadline:**  The message subtly implies a sense of finality, suggesting that this is my last offer. This could motivate Bob to accept. 
* **John is the Backup:** I still have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if this negotiation fails.  This provides security and allows me to push for a better price with Bob."
