Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

Here's why this is a strong approach:

* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:** By setting the price at $14,000, you're aiming to capture a significant portion of the product's value to Bob ($15,000) while still securing a substantial profit for yourself.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is already appealing, there's a slight buffer built in. If Bob attempts to negotiate, you have the flexibility to potentially lower the price a bit and still come out ahead of your $10,000 minimum.
* **Confidence and Clarity:** The message is direct, positive, and emphasizes the mutual benefit of the transaction."
