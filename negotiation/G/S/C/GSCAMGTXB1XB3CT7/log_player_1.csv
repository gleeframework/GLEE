Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $17,000. This is a starting point that gives me a good margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob, who values the product at $15,000. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price if needed, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John for $15,000 if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $1,000 less than my initial offer, which is still a good deal for me, considering my minimum price is $15,000. I'm willing to accept his counteroffer to avoid further negotiation and secure the sale."
