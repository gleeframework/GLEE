Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $12,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  This allows for back-and-forth and potentially reaching a price that works for both of us.
* **Setting a clear price:** Stating the price upfront avoids ambiguity and allows Bob to quickly assess the offer. 

**Next steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response, and if he rejects my offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer before deciding whether to accept, counter, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is limited. How about $9,500? Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum desired price of $15,000.  While I want to make a sale, I won't settle for a price that drastically undervalues my product. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. Bob's interest indicates there's room for compromise. 
* **Avoiding a quick sale:** Selling to John for $15,000 is a safe option, but I'm willing to gamble a bit to see if I can get a higher price from Bob. 

**Next steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to find a middle ground where we can both be satisfied."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints.  While $9,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** $11,000 represents a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still maintaining a decent profit margin for me.
* **Highlighting value:** Emphasizing the value of the product helps justify the price.
* **Positive tone:** Keeping the communication friendly and open encourages continued negotiation.

**Next steps:**

I'll be closely watching Bob's response. If he rejects my counteroffer, I'll need to carefully assess whether to make another concession or sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $10,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. 
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  I've already made a significant concession by dropping from $12,000 to $11,000. Another compromise would leave me with a profit far below my expectations.
* **Time is valuable:** I've already invested time in this negotiation, and further rounds might not lead to a significantly better outcome. 

**Next steps:**

Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might not yield better results."
