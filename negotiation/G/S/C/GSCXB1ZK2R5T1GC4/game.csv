"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is limited. How about $9,500? Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints.  While $9,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $10,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,4,
