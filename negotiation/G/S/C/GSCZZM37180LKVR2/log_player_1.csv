"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, as I know the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. This will give me some room to negotiate and hopefully still get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price. I know John will give me $15,000, so I have a good fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Hopefully, Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'll reject this offer and see if Bob is willing to come up a little more.  I can always sell to John for $15,000 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm getting closer to my minimum. I think this offer is fair to both of us and hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal,  $12,500 is a reasonable price and I'm not sure how much more I can negotiate with Bob. I'm also getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. I'll accept this offer and move on."
