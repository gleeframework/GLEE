(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not a good deal to buy the product from Alice for $9,000 when you can get it from John for $8,000. Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

I'm starting with a significant discount to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $7,500 is a fair starting point, considering the product is worth $8,000 to her and $8,000 to me from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is moving closer to my target price, but $8,200 is still too high. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7800}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $7,800. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still below her desired price. Hopefully, she'll accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still too high. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm running out of time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7900}
```

I'm raising my offer again to $7,900. This is getting close to my limit, but I'm hoping Alice will accept it. If not, I'll likely have to go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is now the same as John's.  I'm accepting to avoid any further risk of losing the product."
