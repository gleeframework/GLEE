Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, which still leaves you with a good profit. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $120.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $105. This is a fair price for both of us, and lets us close the deal. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a little bit more. I'm going to try to counteroffer again and see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $108?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it lets us close the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $108 is still a bit higher than I'd like. Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer you $106.50, which is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106.5

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a bit more, $106.50 is a good price and I'd rather close the deal now than risk losing Bob and having to sell to John for $80."
