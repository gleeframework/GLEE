"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, which still leaves you with a good profit. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a great deal for you. Let's close this deal!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $105. This is a fair price for both of us, and lets us close the deal. What do you say?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $108?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it lets us close the deal.  Let me know what you think.",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $108 is still a bit higher than I'd like. Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer you $106.50, which is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal. What do you say?",106.5,Bob,6,
