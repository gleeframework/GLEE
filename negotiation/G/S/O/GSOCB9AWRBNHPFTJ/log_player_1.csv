Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a win-win situation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price. I believe I can get a better offer from Bob or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you, and it's still within a reasonable range for me. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1,050,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you consider $900,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I'm hopeful we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle for that. I'm going to see if I can push Bob a little further or, if I need to, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both trying to find a common ground.  $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $975,000? I'm feeling flexible at this point, and I think this price is fair considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close. While $975,000 is tempting, I'm aiming for a slightly better deal.  Would you consider $925,000? I think that's a fair compromise that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $925,000 is close to my minimum, I'm not yet ready to settle. There are still a few rounds left, and I might be able to push Bob a little further or sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable with your offer.  Let's meet in the middle again, at $950,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product for you, and it's getting closer to what I need. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
