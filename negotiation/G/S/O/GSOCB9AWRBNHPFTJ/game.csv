"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a win-win situation. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you, and it's still within a reasonable range for me. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1,050,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you consider $900,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I'm hopeful we can find a compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both trying to find a common ground.  $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $975,000? I'm feeling flexible at this point, and I think this price is fair considering the value of the product to you.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. While $975,000 is tempting, I'm aiming for a slightly better deal.  Would you consider $925,000? I think that's a fair compromise that benefits us both.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable with your offer.  Let's meet in the middle again, at $950,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product for you, and it's getting closer to what I need. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,7,
