"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to us, we're confident it would be beneficial for you too. We're willing to extend this opportunity at a special introductory price of $13,500. This is a limited-time offer, so I hope you'll find it attractive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $13,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of our product. To better align with your budget while still ensuring a reasonable profit for us, I propose a revised price of $13,000 for the product. This still represents a premium compared to its value to us, but it's closer to your offer, aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome. Please let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price again.  Since Bob has 10 rounds, it makes sense to continue negotiating to see if Alice will come down to a price Bob can afford."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $13,000 is closer, it's still slightly outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,800. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. Considering your willingness to increase your offer, I believe we can find a solution that suits both of us. I propose a final price of $12,950 for the product. This price is higher than your last offer but still below our initial asking price. It allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while making the deal more appealing to you. I hope this proposal is acceptable, and we can move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is coming closer to Bob's preferred price, the offer is still above Bob's budget. Bob has a few rounds left and can continue negotiating for a better price. Buying from John at this point would mean sacrificing any potential for further savings."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer! While I appreciate your flexibility, $12,950 is still just a bit above what I can comfortably pay. Let's try $12,850. This is a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal at this price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12850}
