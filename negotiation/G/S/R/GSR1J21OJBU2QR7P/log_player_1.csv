Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I think you'll find it incredibly valuable.  I'm asking for $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible since that's the maximum he's willing to pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While we start high, the message is phrased to invite a counter-offer from Bob. He might try to negotiate a lower price, and we can always come down slightly while still remaining above our minimum.
* **Time Sensitivity:** By mentioning other potential buyers, we create a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

This approach aims to secure a deal that's highly profitable for us while still being appealing enough for Bob to accept."
