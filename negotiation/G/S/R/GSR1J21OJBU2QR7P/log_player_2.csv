# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I think you'll find it incredibly valuable.  I'm asking for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
