"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $7,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. This product offers you substantial value, worth far more than your initial offer reflects. How about we meet closer to the middle at $8,750?",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $8,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $7,500. Can we meet at this price?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try this - $8,100.  I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment, and this offer keeps us both moving in the right direction.",8100.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $8,100. I'm willing to make another concession, so I'll offer $7,500. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any higher.",7500.0,Bob,6,
