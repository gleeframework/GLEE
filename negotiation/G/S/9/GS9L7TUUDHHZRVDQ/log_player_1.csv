"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to secure a higher price while leaving room for negotiation.  I'll see if he bites, but I'm prepared to lower the price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a better price.  There are still 8 rounds left, so I have time to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. It's still above my minimum value, but it shows I'm willing to compromise.  Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to come up with a higher counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to get a better price.  There are still 6 rounds left, so I have time to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering the price again, but not by much. I'm hoping to show Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal, but also that I'm not willing to go too far below my minimum value.  I'm hoping this will prompt him to increase his offer."
