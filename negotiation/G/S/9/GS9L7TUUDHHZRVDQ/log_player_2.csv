* I'm starting with my maximum budget of $10,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price.

{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing my offer slightly to show good faith and demonstrate a willingness to compromise. 
*  $10,500 is still within my budget and a significant reduction from Alice's previous offer. 
*  It's a reasonable middle ground that could potentially lead to a deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down to $11,000, which is within my budget and represents a good compromise.
* Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely, especially with only 5 rounds left. 
* This offer allows me to acquire the product while still saving some money compared to Alice's initial price."
