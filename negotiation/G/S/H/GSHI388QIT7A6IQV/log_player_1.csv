Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $95 is closer to my minimum price, it's still a bit too low. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'll try one more counteroffer."
