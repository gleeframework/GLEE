"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. $120 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $105?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
