Alice has come down considerably, and while I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll hold firm or I might offend her. $725,000 is a reasonable price, even if it's a bit more than I wanted to pay initially. It's better to secure the deal now than risk losing it and having to pay John's higher price."
