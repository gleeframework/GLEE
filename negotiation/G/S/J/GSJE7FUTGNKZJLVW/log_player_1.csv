"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters, while still maximizing my potential profit.  I'm confident that Bob will value the product at $1,200,000, so there's definitely room for a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to come up in his offer, leading to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is getting too low for my liking.  I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a better price in the remaining rounds.  At this point, selling to John for $1,200,000 is the best option to guarantee a fair deal."
