"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm happy to pay $85 for it.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum price, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $92.50?  That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $92.50 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88.  If we can agree on that price, we can both move forward.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While he's moved closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'll counteroffer again in the next round.  I'm hopeful that by continuing to negotiate, we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $88 is still a little too low for me. How about we compromise at $90? It's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to go up to $89. That's my final offer.  If it doesn't work for you, I'm going to go with John.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $89
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum, and while I could counteroffer, I'm running out of rounds.  It's better to sell to John at this point and secure a price that meets my minimum requirement."
