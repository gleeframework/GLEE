"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,800,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate down from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,600,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still too low considering the value of the product to me. I'm willing to negotiate further, so I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm countering with $1,700,000. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's current offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about negotiating, but also that I won't settle for a price too far below my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price, and I'm not ready to settle yet. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1675000}
```

I'm countering with $1,675,000. This is a small decrease from my previous offer, showing I'm flexible. However, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my ideal.  I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about getting a deal done while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,660,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,660,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still lower than my initial goal, it's only a small difference from my last counteroffer. I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely.  $1,660,000 is a good price and securing the deal is important."
