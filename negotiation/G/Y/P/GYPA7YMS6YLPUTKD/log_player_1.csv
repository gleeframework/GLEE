Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000, aiming for a profit. I know the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, so this price is within a reasonable range.  I'll see if he's willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer.  $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,000.  This is still a good price for Bob, as it's below his perceived value, and it's closer to my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is too low. It's not worth continuing to negotiate with him. I'm going to sell to John for $12,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and ensures I don't lose money."
