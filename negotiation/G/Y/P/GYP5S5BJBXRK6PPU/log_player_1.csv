{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase [product name] for a limited time. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth in the market.  Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the backup:** Having a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000 provides a strong safety net. Alice doesn't need to desperately low-ball the price.
* **Starting high:**  While $1,100,000 is more than Bob's perceived value, it leaves room for negotiation.  It's easier to negotiate down than up.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" subtly justifies the high price without revealing Alice's absolute bottom line.
* **Limited time offer:**  Creating a sense of urgency can nudge Bob to make a decision faster."
