"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is my minimum value, I'm not willing to settle for that right away. There are still 9 rounds left, and I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still have time to negotiate and hopefully get a better price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I hope to get a deal before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While we are getting close to my minimum, I believe there is still room for negotiation. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before seriously considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is a very small step down from my previous offer, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. I've been trying to get a higher price from Bob, but his offers are now below my minimum, and I'm running out of rounds. It's better to accept the guaranteed $10,000 from John than risk getting even less from Bob."
