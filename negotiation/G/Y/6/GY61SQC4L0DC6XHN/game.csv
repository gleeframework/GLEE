"Bob, I understand you're trying to save money, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,050,000? This price still gives you a good deal, while allowing me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. While $990,000 is closer, it's still not quite there for me. Let's try to find a final compromise. I'm willing to go down to $1,020,000.
