"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's worth at least $20,000 due to its unique value, but to kickstart our negotiation, I'm willing to let it go for $19,000. What do you say?",19000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $19,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $12,000 would be more realistic. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept for this product.  It has a lot of value that I believe justifies a higher price point. How about we meet in the middle at $16,500?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a budget in mind. How about we settle at $14,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,
