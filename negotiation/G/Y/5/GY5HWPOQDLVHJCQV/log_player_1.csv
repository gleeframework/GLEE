"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $150 for the product, which is fair for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer.  While $150 is my minimum, I can likely get closer to my initial price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about $165? It's a fair compromise, and we can both be happy."", ""product_price"": 165}
