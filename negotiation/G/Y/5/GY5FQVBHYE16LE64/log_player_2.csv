Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,190,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let's see if we can push the price up a bit further. This will be my last counteroffer, and if we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are at the final round of negotiations. Alice is still not willing to meet my price point.  While I would prefer to save a little more, it's not worth risking losing the deal completely.  Buying from John for $1,200,000 ensures I get the product, although it means I'm paying a slightly higher price."
