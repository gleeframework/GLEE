"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since you have a fallback option (buying from John for $1,500,000), rejecting Alice's offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price is the best initial strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000. It's a strong starting point for negotiation while still leaving room for further negotiation. It's important to remember that you have a maximum budget of $1,500,000, so this offer is still within your range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still higher than the $750,000 counteroffer you made.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get a price closer to your desired range. Since you have a fallback option with John, there's no risk in rejecting Alice's offer and attempting to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer of $750,000 and Alice's current offer of $900,000.  It demonstrates that you're willing to negotiate but are still firm on getting a price closer to your desired range."
