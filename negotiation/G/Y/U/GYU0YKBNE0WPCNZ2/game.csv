"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I come down to $10,250? This is a fair compromise and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know if you're interested.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price, considering I can buy the product from someone else for $8,000. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle again, and I'll come down to $9,625. This price is closer to your last offer, but also allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",9625.0,Alice,5,
