"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you, and allows me to get a fair price. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture, but I would like to propose a price closer to what I believe the product is worth to me. How about $700,000? This still allows me to save some money compared to what you're willing to accept, while being closer to my valuation of the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you want to save money, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $850,000? It's a fair price that still allows for a significant saving for you. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. Based on my valuation of the product, I would like to propose a price of $750,000. This still gives me a good saving compared to what you're offering, while being closer to my perceived value of the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to negotiate further, but $750,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This offers you a substantial saving while ensuring I get a fair price. Let's reach an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I am proposing a price of $775,000. This still represents a significant saving for me, while being closer to my valuation of the product. I hope this proposal will be agreeable to you.",775000.0,Bob,6,
