"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",850000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to negotiate, but $700,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $775,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming closer to my range.  While $775,000 is better, I'm still aiming for something closer to my budget.  How about $730,000?",730000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're willing to make a deal, but $730,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer it to you for $760,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can wrap up the deal here.",760000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $760,000 is close, I'm still feeling a little squeezed.  To make this work, I'd need to be at $745,000.  Let me know if that's possible.",745000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $745,000 is still not acceptable to me. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $750,000, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options.",750000.0,Alice,7,
