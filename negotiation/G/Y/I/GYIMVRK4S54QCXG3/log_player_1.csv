I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?
