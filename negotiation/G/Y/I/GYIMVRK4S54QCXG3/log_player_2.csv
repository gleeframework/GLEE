# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to negotiate, but $700,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're willing to make a deal, but $730,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer it to you for $760,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can wrap up the deal here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $760,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $760,000 is close, I'm still feeling a little squeezed.  To make this work, I'd need to be at $745,000.  Let me know if that's possible."", ""product_price"": 745000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $745,000 is still not acceptable to me. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $750,000, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is signaling this is her final offer. While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's a risk she'll walk away.  $750,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer and a reasonable compromise."
