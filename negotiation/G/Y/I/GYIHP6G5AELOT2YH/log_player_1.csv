"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $175. It's a great deal and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than Bob's valuation, leaving room for negotiation.  It's a strong opening move, but not so high that it immediately alienates Bob. I'm also adding a friendly message to create a good starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $140?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $140 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $155?  It's still a good deal for you and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested, but $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $150?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price and it's the same price I can get from John.  I'll accept his offer to close the deal."
