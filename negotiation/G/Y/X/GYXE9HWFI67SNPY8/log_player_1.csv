Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is only worth $10,000 to Bob. 
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 from John.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you're in a strong position. There's no need to go below your minimum price. The strategy is to aim high with Bob, knowing you have John as a backup.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value and the current market demand, I'm proposing a price of $13,500. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. Let me know if you're interested, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 13500 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:**  You start with a price above Bob's perceived value and your minimum.
* **Justification (Without Over-Explaining):**  You vaguely mention ""unique value"" and ""market demand"" to create a sense of desirability.
* **Alternative Options:**  By mentioning ""other interested parties,"" you create a sense of urgency and competition.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Excellent! You've exceeded your minimum and maximized your profit.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  He might try to negotiate a lower price. You have room to come down slightly while still staying above your $12,000 floor. 
* **Bob Rejects:**  No problem! You have John ready to buy at your desired price."
