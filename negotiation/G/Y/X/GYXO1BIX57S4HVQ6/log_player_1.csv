Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain from it.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1300000 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer, aiming high initially allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" to justify the high price without revealing Bob's maximum valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The phrasing ""initially proposing"" and asking for Bob's thoughts suggests flexibility and opens the door for counter-offers. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering a price closer to my own valuation increases the chances of Bob countering with a price closer to his maximum of $800,000,  which is still a significant profit for me."
