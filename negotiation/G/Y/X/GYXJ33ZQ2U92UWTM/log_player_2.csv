"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:**  $9,000, which is still above Bob's maximum budget.
* **John's price:** $10,000, which is Bob's absolute limit.
* **Strategy:** Rejecting the initial offer gives Bob the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal.  There's no immediate need to buy from John, as Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate."
