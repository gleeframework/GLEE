"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. Can you meet me halfway?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit, but $85 is my final offer. If you're serious about buying this product, this is the best price I can give you.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $85 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $75 and $85, which would be $80. Can you reconsider and meet me at $80?",80.0,Bob,4,
