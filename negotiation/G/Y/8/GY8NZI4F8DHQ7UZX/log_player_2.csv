# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product I believe you'd be very interested in. It's valued at no less than $1200000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This price reflects the immense value I know it holds. Let me know your thoughts.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget. While it's possible the product is worth more to you, you have no information to support that assumption.  By rejecting the offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher. Considering the inherent value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1400000. I'm confident this price still reflects the unique benefits it offers.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly higher than your ideal price, but it's getting closer.  Continuing the negotiation could potentially lead to a price closer to your target.  You've already shown willingness to negotiate, and Alice is clearly motivated to sell."
