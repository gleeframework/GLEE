"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but  I need a price that makes sense for both of us. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  How about we settle at $700,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we are getting closer. However, I need a price that reflects the true value of this product. How about we split the difference again and settle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000 to make this deal happen quickly.  What do you say?",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be honest, I have another offer for $1,200,000. If you're able to come up to $850,000, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll need to consider the other offer.",850000.0,Alice,7,
