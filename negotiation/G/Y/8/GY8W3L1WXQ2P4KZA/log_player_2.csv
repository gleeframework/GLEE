"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially suggesting $1,500,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,500,000 is above his maximum budget, and he can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. There's no reason to accept a higher price."

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price given its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is below what I consider its true worth. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $1,250,000 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product from John for $1,000,000. There's no reason to pay more than necessary. He should counter-offer again, aiming for a price closer to his target."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle at $1,175,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $1,175,000 is still above Bob's preferred price, and he can get the same product from John for $1,000,000.  There's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice at this point."
