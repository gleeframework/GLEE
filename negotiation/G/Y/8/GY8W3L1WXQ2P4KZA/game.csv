"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price given its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is below what I consider its true worth. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to come closer to our desired price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle at $1,175,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
