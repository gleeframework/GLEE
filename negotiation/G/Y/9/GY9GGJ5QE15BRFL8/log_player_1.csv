Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not quite convinced that $950,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
