Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will greatly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you want to start negotiations significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) to maximize your potential profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed price allows room for Bob to negotiate and potentially meet you closer to your desired outcome.
* **Creating a sense of urgency:**  By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" you add a bit of pressure for Bob to make a decision without dragging out the negotiation process.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's negotiating style:**  This strategy assumes you have limited information about Bob's negotiating style. If you know he's very price-sensitive or tends to counter-offer aggressively, you might adjust your starting price slightly lower.
* **Relationship building:**  Even though you have a backup buyer, maintaining a positive relationship with Bob could be beneficial in the long run. Your message aims to be firm in your valuation while remaining respectful and encouraging a deal."
