"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,400,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the $1,200,000 price doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000. I believe this price offers a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. However,  $1,325,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,275,000. This price is a significant compromise on my end and I believe it's fair given the potential value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly willing to pay significantly more than our safety net with John. While his offer is increasing, it's still substantially below his perceived value of the product.  We have room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,300,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring the product's value is recognized."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,300,000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to go to $1,290,000. This offer demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal, but it's the absolute maximum I can offer at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob's offer is getting very close to our desired range, and his latest message suggests he's reaching his upper limit. Accepting at $1,290,000 secures a significant profit above our $1,000,000 minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away in further rounds."
