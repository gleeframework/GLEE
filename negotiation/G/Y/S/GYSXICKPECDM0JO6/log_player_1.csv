Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it offers. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but is still less than your minimum desired price. This creates room for negotiation while also setting a clear expectation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's better to continue negotiating and see if we can find a middle ground, rather than settling for such a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking of a price more like $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's closer to what I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price than my previous counteroffer. It's important to remember that  John is always a viable option if the negotiations with Bob fail."
