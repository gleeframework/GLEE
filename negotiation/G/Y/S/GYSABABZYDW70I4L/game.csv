"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,800,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if you're interested!",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,800,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering you value it at $1,500,000. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is exactly what you value the product at. This would be a fair deal for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,500,000. I think it's worth more to you than that. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $1,700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the fact that I'm willing to negotiate. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
