{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price but lower than what Bob is willing to pay. This allows room for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

While $10,000 is a decent offer, it's still lower than what I'm hoping to get. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a great price for you, given the product's value to you. Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 11000}
