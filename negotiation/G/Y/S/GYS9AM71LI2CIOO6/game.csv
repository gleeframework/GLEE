"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  Would you be interested in paying $8,500 for the product?  This would still be a good deal for you, considering its value to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate you coming up with a new offer. However, $7,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again - how about $8,125? It's a fair compromise, and it's still below the value you placed on the product. What do you think?",8125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for continuing this negotiation.  I'm getting closer to being ready to close this deal. What if we settled at $7,900?",7900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your offer is getting closer to what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal.  What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,7,
