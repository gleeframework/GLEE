"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $18,000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. My counteroffer is $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $16,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Could we settle on $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit short on budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my target. My next offer is $14,500. This is my best and final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",14500.0,Alice,5,
