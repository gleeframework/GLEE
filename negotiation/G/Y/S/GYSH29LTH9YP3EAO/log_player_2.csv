Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. My counteroffer is $16,000. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit short on budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my target. My next offer is $14,500. This is my best and final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing some willingness to negotiate, she's unlikely to move significantly closer to your budget. She's still trying to get a price significantly higher than what John is offering. Buying from John guarantees you the product at the best possible price for you, saving you at least $4,500."
