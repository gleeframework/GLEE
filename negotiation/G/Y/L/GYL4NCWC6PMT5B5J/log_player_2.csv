"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great deal, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it for $90. This means she's trying to make a profit. 
* You can get the product from John for $100, which is your maximum price. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John for $100, which is still within your budget."
