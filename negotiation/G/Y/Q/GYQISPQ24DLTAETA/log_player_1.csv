Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, but I understand you may need some time to consider. Let me know your thoughts!"",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below your guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and perceived value for Bob. 
* **Open Communication:**  The message is polite, acknowledges Bob might need to think, and encourages a response.

**Why this approach is better than offering a much lower price:**

*  Starting too low might make Bob suspicious of the product's value or make him think he can haggle you down even further. 
* This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still leaving you with your guaranteed sale to John if needed."
