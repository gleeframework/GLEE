"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay $9,500 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the current market conditions. I look forward to your response.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $10,250?  This price still allows for a fair profit for me while staying within a reasonable range for you. Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $10,250 is slightly above my budget. Would you consider bringing your price down to $10,000? This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I hope we can come to a fair solution.",10000.0,Bob,4,
