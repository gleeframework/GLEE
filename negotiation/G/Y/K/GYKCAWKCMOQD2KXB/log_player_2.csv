"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer it at this price again. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is too expensive for me, and I can get it from John for a much better price.
