Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $800,000 and go from there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you moving a bit.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $1,000,000. If you're able to come down to $1,125,000, I'm ready to close the deal with you today.  Please let me know.

While we could push Bob further, he's revealed he has another offer at his psychological price point of $1,000,000. Accepting his offer of $1,125,000 secures a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of him going with the other offer."
