Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation and ensures you make a substantial profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum value:** This gives Bob incentive to accept the offer, knowing he'll still get a good deal. 

By starting with a higher price, you can potentially secure a better price, while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob rejects the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum desired profit. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob.  I'll counter his offer with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,300,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $1,400,000 and Bob's offer of $1,200,000.  It's still a good profit for me and leaves room for further negotiation if Bob is willing to go higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  However, I don't want to sell to John for $1,000,000 yet.  I'll counter Bob's offer again with a higher price. There's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,250,000. This is a slight increase from his offer of $1,150,000. It's a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still secures a price closer to my desired minimum. This gives Bob the chance to accept a fair price while still getting a good deal, and it keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could counteroffer again, the negotiation seems to be stalling, and I'm not sure we'll reach a satisfactory price.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a profit, and it's time to move on rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
