"I understand you have a budget to stick to, Bob. However, I've invested a significant amount in this product and I'm looking for a better return. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10500. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I'm thinking we could meet at $10000, which is the minimum I need to get from the sale. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me and the investment I've made in it.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product, which is my absolute maximum budget. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me and the investment you've made in it.",9500.0,Bob,6,
