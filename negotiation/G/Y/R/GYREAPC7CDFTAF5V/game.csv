"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $9,000. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'll offer you the product for $10,500. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm feeling like we're getting close.  Would you be willing to do $9,500?  That's the best I can offer.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $9,500, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I'll tell you what - I'll meet you at $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. It's the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Alice,7,
