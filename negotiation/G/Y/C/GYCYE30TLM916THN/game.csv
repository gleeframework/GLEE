"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm comfortable paying $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
