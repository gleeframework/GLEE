Alice's starting offer is quite high. There's a lot of room for negotiation here. I should counter-offer with a much lower price to try and get a better deal."

Alice came down quite a bit, but her offer is still above her own valuation of the product. There's still room for negotiation. I should counter-offer with a price closer to my initial offer to see if I can get a better deal."
