Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it's incredibly valuable, and I'm confident it will be useful to you. I'm asking for $120 to start. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 
Let's start high to test Bob's willingness to pay.  Even if he rejects this initial offer, it gives us room to negotiate down towards his valuation of $80 while aiming to get as close to our desired price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

While Bob's offer matches his valuation, we can try negotiating a slightly higher price since we have the option to sell to John for $80. Let's see if Bob is willing to budge a little."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand that price is a factor, but I'm confident in the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

We're splitting the difference between our initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This aims for a price that's favorable to us while potentially remaining appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really only willing to pay $85. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is signaling that $85 is his absolute limit and he's considering John's offer. Accepting this offer gives us a profit beyond our minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
