Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its unique value proposition, I'm asking for $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong buyer lined up."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, we want to see if we can get a better deal from Bob first.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $1,100,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob is willing to negotiate. It's a significant profit for Alice compared to John's offer and still a considerable saving for Bob compared to the product's worth to him ($800,000).
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning a ""strong buyer lined up"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision faster. 

**Important Note:**  This initial offer leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can then decide whether to accept, counter again, or move on to John."
