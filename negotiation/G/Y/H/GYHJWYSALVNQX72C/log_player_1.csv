Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value but significantly below my minimum. This creates room for negotiation and incentivizes Bob to consider the offer.
* **Flexibility:** I'm open to negotiation, as indicated by my message. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I have John as a backup buyer who will pay my minimum price. This allows me to walk away from the deal with Bob if he isn't willing to meet my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $10000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000 and even below my initial offer.
* **John as a Backup:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000. This is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation:** I will counter Bob's offer to explore a compromise while maintaining my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraint. However, I can't go as low as $10,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to maintain a fair price for my product.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer offers a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his initial offer ($10,000) and my previous offer ($12,000). 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the value of the product for Bob, reminding him that even at $11,000, it's a good deal.
* **Maintaining Minimum:**  $11,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, allowing me to potentially close the deal while still ensuring a good outcome for myself."
