"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $11,000. I'm looking to save as much as possible, so I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $11,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be compensated for the value of this product. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,500? This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and it gives us both a fair deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still trying to save as much as possible. How about we settle on $12,200? This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",12200.0,Bob,4,
