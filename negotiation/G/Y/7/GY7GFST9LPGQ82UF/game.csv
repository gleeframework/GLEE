"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort you've put into determining a fair price. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $900000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation and we can move forward with the transaction.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to maximize the value of the product. I'm willing to consider a compromise, but I need to stay above $850000. I'm offering you the product for $850000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value you've placed on it.",850000.0,Alice,3,
