"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a price that I think is very reasonable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you won't want to pass up.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's a good deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
