"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That product looks great, but I was hoping to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a price significantly lower than Alice's offer ($85 vs. $100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Positive:**  Maintaining a friendly tone encourages a smoother negotiation process.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  My offer is still significantly higher than Alice's value for the product ($85 vs. $80), giving her a potential profit margin."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do a bit better than that, Bob. I'm willing to sell it to you for $92.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate.  She's met me halfway, so I'll go up a bit and see if we can settle closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference and call it $90 even?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This is a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties. 
* **Reaching a Target:** $90 is a good price for me, well below my maximum and a decent savings off the original offer. 
* **Potential for Agreement:**  Alice might be willing to accept to close the deal, as it's a small concession for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're a shrewd negotiator, Bob! I can meet you halfway between $90 and $92.50, so I'll sell it to you for $91.25. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Negotiating any further is unlikely to yield significant savings. Alice is clearly willing to meet in the middle, and $91.25 is a very reasonable price. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate takes time and effort. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids potentially dragging out the process. 
* **Good Deal Overall:** $91.25 is significantly less than my $120 alternative with John and a good savings overall."
