"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1400000 is significantly lower than the value I've placed on it.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000, meeting you halfway on the price difference. This reflects the product's unique capabilities and potential for your business.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
