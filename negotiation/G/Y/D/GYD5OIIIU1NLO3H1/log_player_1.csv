Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to, potentially leading to a higher final price. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:** This price is significantly higher than John's offer of $10,000, ensuring a good profit even if Bob tries to negotiate down. 

By starting high but still below Bob's perceived value, Alice increases her chances of securing a very favorable deal."
