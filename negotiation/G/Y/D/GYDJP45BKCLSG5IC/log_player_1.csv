Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Not too high:** I'm not aiming for my full value ($1,500,000) immediately, as that might make Bob walk away.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  The price is below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), allowing for counteroffers and negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects my offer, I'll assess his counteroffer. 
* If his counteroffer is too low, I'll make a counteroffer closer to my initial price.
* If I feel I'm not getting close to my desired price, I can always choose to sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer closer to my initial price to see if we can find a middle ground.

**Next Steps:**

* I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price between his offer of $900,000 and my initial offer of $1,300,000. 
* I will keep in mind that I can always choose to sell to John if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your interest, $900,000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that considers both our positions.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering within a reasonable range:** My counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a compromise between my initial offer of $1,300,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000. 
* **Keeping it above my minimum:**  This price is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Emphasizing value and compromise:** I've included a message that acknowledges Bob's budget while also emphasizing the product's value.

**Next Steps:**

* I will closely monitor Bob's response to this counteroffer.
* If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I will consider making a final counteroffer closer to his price but still above my minimum.
* If Bob continues to refuse my offers, I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,100,000. How about we meet at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $950,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited negotiating room:**  While Bob has shown some flexibility, his offers are consistently below my threshold. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob will take time and energy. Selling to John immediately guarantees me my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $1,500,000. 
* It's a better decision to secure my desired price rather than risking a further decrease in value through continued negotiations with Bob."
