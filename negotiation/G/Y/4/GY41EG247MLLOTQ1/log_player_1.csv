Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a [product description] that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiations. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Product description:** Replace this with a brief and enticing description of your product. 
* **$10,000:** This is my starting offer. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but I'm leaving room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get a higher price from Bob if possible.

**Why this approach?**

* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Starting higher allows for a negotiation that potentially benefits both of us. Bob might be willing to pay more than $8,000 but less than $10,000. 
* **Showing confidence:** A higher starting price can convey that I believe in the value of my product.
* **Worst-case scenario:** If Bob rejects, I'll still make $8,000 from John. 

**Important note:** This is just an example. The ideal offer will depend on various factors like the product, your relationship with Bob, and how confident you are that Bob is willing to pay more than John."
