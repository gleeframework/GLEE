"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, your initial price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true worth and my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's value.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,175,000?  I feel this price represents a reasonable compromise for both of us.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the product's value warrants a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us. ",1250000.0,Alice,5,
