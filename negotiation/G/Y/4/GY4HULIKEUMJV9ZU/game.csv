"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you, and it's still a good price for me. Let me know what you think!",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price.  However, I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can make this work.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant at $12,500. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,250?  This would give us both a fair deal.",12250.0,Bob,4,
