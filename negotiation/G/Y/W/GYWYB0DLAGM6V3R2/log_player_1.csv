"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good deal quickly. But I'm also leaving some room for negotiation, in case Bob wants to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is a decent offer, it's still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $10,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I think I can still get a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm dropping my offer to $10,000, acknowledging Bob's reluctance to go higher. However, I still believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to him. This is my last attempt to secure a better deal before considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $8,500 is only slightly better than what John is offering, I've already made a significant concession and I doubt Bob will go higher.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to negotiate."
