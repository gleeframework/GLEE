"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  You can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer.  You have a significant buffer between your maximum price ($1,500,000) and Alice's offer, giving you leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's closer to Alice's value while still being within my budget. This should encourage Alice to negotiate further.  I'm leaving room to potentially come up a bit if needed, but I believe a million dollars is a fair starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is significantly closer to my target price.  While I could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting another offer and me having to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential savings. At this point, accepting her offer secures the product at a good price within my budget."
