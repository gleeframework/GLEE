Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially leave room for negotiation.  This will give me a good idea of whether he sees the value of the product close to mine, or if it's much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but it's still lower than what I'm hoping for. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, but not by much. I'm hoping to signal that I'm willing to negotiate, but still want to get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now lower than my minimum, but it's still better than selling to John. I'll reject his offer and counter to see if we can get closer to a deal."

I'm going to meet Bob halfway on his last offer,  hoping that this will be more appealing to him than going back and forth any further. This is a good compromise and still gets me significantly closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure we'll be able to agree.  It's better to sell to John for $1,000,000 than to risk a prolonged negotiation that could ultimately result in a lower price."
