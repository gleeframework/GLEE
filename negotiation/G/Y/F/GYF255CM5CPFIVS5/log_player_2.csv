You should reject Alice's offer. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first. Even if you don't get to $10,000, you might be able to get a better deal than $11,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a lower offer of $9,500 to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. This is still below my maximum price of $10,000, but leaves room for negotiation."

Alice is getting closer to my maximum price, but it's still more expensive than buying from John. I'll take the safer option and buy from John."
