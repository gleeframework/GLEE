"Hi Alice,  $20,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in the product but can only offer $12,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is still quite a ways off from what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $14,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle at $15,000 even? That's my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
