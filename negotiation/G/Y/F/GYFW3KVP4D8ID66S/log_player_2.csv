"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above Bob's budget of $12,000.  It's much better to reject and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $20,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in the product but can only offer $12,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is still quite a ways off from what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to Bob's desired price, $16,000 is still above Bob's budget.  Bob can still try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $14,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle at $15,000 even? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $15,000 is still above Bob's budget of $12,000.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, as Bob has a guaranteed deal with John for a better price."
