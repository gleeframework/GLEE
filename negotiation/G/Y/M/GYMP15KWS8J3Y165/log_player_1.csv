I'm starting with a high offer, but one that still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, and I want to maximize my earnings while keeping the negotiation open."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value.  I believe this counteroffer will be attractive to Bob, and we'll be able to close the deal in the next few rounds."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm running out of time.  With John offering the same price, I'll take the sure thing and sell to John.  I've already established my minimum acceptable price, and I'm comfortable closing the deal."
