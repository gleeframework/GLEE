"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. Would you consider $790,000 for the product?",790000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $790,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product.  Given its unique capabilities and the potential it holds for your business, I believe a price closer to $825,000 would be more reflective of its worth.  Let's keep the conversation going and see if we can find common ground.",825000.0,Alice,3,
