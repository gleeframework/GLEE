"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is above your budget, but I'm still confident that this product has significant value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's unique features and benefits. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still a bit outside of my comfort zone.  Considering my initial offer and the potential for future business with you, I'm prepared to go to $775000.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $825000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $812500. This is the lowest I can go without sacrificing my profit margin. What do you think?",812500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility, but $812500 is still just a bit too high for me. Considering your previous concessions and the value of this deal, I'm willing to go up to $800000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,6,
