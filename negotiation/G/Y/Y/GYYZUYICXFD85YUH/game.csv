"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. My counteroffer is $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get the price down, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make another concession, though. My counteroffer is $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
