"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This represents a substantial compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of this product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
