"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,300,000. This price is fair considering the value I place on it. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I recognize your valuation, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this price reflects the value I see in the product and is a fair compromise. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
