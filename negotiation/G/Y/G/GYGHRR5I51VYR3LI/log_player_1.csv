Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$20,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than my minimum value but not outrageous. It leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message:** It's friendly and open-ended, inviting Bob to discuss the offer further. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  A rejection at this price point could indicate it's not worth much to him, allowing me to negotiate better with John. 
* **Potentially get a higher price:**  If Bob is truly interested, there's a chance he'll accept or counter-offer, allowing me to potentially earn more than my minimum."
