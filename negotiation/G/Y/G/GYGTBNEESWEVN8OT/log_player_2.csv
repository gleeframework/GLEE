You can do better than $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."

I'm offering $9,000. This is still significantly less than Alice's asking price, but it's a good starting point for negotiation.  It's also a fair price for me, as I'm willing to pay up to $8,000."

I'm still going to reject Alice's offer. It's getting closer to my limit, but I can still try to get a better price."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $9,500.  This is a compromise, showing I'm serious about buying from her, but still within my comfortable price range."
