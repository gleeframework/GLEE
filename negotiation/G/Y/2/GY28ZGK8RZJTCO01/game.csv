"Thanks Alice, I appreciate the offer! It's a great product, but I'm not sure I can go that high right now.  I'm willing to pay $11000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $13500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $13500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you in the middle. I'll offer $12500. This is my final offer.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $12500. I'm willing to go slightly higher, so I'm offering $13250. This is my best price. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,
