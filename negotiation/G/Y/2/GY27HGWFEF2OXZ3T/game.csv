"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product at a price of $1,000,000. It's a rare opportunity to acquire something truly valuable, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,,

"Alice, your product looks promising, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we settle on $750,000?  It's a win-win.",750000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,900000.0
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $800,000. Would you consider $825,000?  It's a strong offer.",825000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,950000.0
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I still think $825,000 is a bit low considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $950,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,,
