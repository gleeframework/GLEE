"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",120.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though! I can offer it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll still get a lot of value out of it.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $105. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your last concession, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. I've already found another seller who is willing to sell it to me for this price, so I'm not in a position to negotiate further.",100.0,Bob,6,
