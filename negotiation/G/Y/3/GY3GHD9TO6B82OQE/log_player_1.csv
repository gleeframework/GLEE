Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I think the product is worth around $100. Would you consider lowering the price to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a little more than $100. Even though John is offering $100, it's worth the risk of a few more rounds to potentially earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you value the product at $100.  I'm willing to come down to $105, but I can't go lower than that.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. Considering my valuation of the product, I would like to propose a price of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob is clearly sticking to his $100 valuation, and I've already lowered my price from $110 to $105. It's unlikely he'll budge further, and there's a good chance he'll just continue rejecting offers.  Since John is offering my minimum price, it's safer to sell to him and avoid any further negotiation risks."
