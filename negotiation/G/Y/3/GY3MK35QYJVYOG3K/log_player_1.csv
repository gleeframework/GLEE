{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy balances maximizing profit with keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider coming down to $650,000? I think that's a fair price that could work for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than the product's worth to Alice and even lower than the offer Alice initially made.  Selling to John guarantees a much higher profit.  

Rejecting Bob's offer allows Alice to make a counteroffer that might bridge the gap or, if Bob doesn't budge, allows her to move on to the guaranteed sale with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value you place on the product. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a deal, it's still significantly lower than the product's worth to Alice. Selling to John guarantees a much higher profit, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will lead to a better outcome."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for $700,000, but I'm still not comfortable going that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $775,000? This allows me to make a decent profit while still giving you a good price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 775000}
