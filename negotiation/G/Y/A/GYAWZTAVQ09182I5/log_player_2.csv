# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget ($1,500,000).  You can potentially save a lot of money by negotiating further. It's likely Alice is willing to go higher than $1,000,000."
