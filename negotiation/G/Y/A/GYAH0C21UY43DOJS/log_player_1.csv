Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I think it's a great deal for you considering its value."", ""product_price"": 145}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $145 is a bit high for me.  How about $135?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
Reason:Bob's offer of $135 is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting this offer ensures a profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether by further negotiation."
