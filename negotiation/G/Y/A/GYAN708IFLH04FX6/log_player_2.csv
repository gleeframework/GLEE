"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I know it's worth it to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $13,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, and he has other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for your product.  Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500? I'm confident you'll still find this a great value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he'd prefer to pay less, $11,500 is still within his budget and a better deal than buying from John.  There's a chance Alice might lower the price further, but there's also a risk she'll stick to her price or even increase it.  It's better to secure a good deal now rather than risk a worse outcome later."
