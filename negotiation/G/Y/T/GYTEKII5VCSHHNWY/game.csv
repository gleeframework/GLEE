"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it would be a valuable asset for you as well. I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. I'm open to negotiating, but let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,300,000 doesn't quite work for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,450,000. This price should be more acceptable to both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,450,000 is getting closer to what I need. However, I'm still just a bit off. How about we settle on $1,475,000?  That way we both get a fair deal, and I can ensure you're getting a fantastic product. Let's make this happen!",1475000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, $1,475,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000. This price should be more acceptable to both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise that allows me to achieve my desired price while still offering you a great deal on this valuable product.  What do you say?",1450000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,450,000. I'm willing to pay $1,425,000. This price should be more acceptable to both of us.",1425000.0,Bob,8,
