"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it would be a valuable asset for you as well. I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. I'm open to negotiating, but let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting high, at $1,750,000, leaving room for negotiation. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:**  I'm trying to build rapport and emphasize the product's value to Bob. I'm also setting the tone for a possible negotiation.
* **Strategic Considerations:**
    * **Round 1:**  I want to start strong and see if Bob is willing to bite.  If he rejects, I can adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds.
    * **John as backup:** Knowing John's offer gives me a safety net. I can always walk away if Bob's counteroffers aren't satisfactory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I need to get closer to that minimum. 

**Why not accept Bob's offer?**

* **Losing money:** Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me.
* **John's offer:**  I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. This gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob.

**Why reject and counteroffer?**

* **Negotiation strategy:**  By rejecting and counteroffering, I demonstrate my willingness to negotiate but also my resolve not to accept a price that doesn't meet my minimum requirements.
* **Potential for compromise:**  I believe there's still room for a mutually beneficial agreement.

In the next round, I'll send Bob a counteroffer that bridges the gap, but still keeps me close to my minimum acceptable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,300,000 doesn't quite work for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing $1,550,000, which is the midpoint between my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and Bob's offer of $1,300,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and framing my counteroffer as a fair and reasonable compromise.  I'm also using positive language to maintain a friendly tone. 
* **Strategic Considerations:**
    * **Meeting halfway:** This approach demonstrates a willingness to negotiate, making it more likely that Bob will be open to a deal.
    * **Staying above minimum:**  I'm still above my minimum price, giving me some room to negotiate further if necessary.
    * **Pressure tactic:**  By offering a compromise, I'm putting the pressure on Bob to respond and either accept or make another counteroffer."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,450,000. This price should be more acceptable to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. 

* **John's offer:**  I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. Accepting Bob's offer would mean leaving $50,000 on the table.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate. There's still room for us to reach a deal closer to my desired price. 

**Why reject and counteroffer:**

* **Pressure tactic:** By rejecting his offer, I'm putting the pressure on Bob to come up with a more favorable offer.
* **Potential for higher price:** There's a good chance that Bob might be willing to increase his offer slightly to secure the deal.

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer slightly higher than Bob's offer but still below John's price. This will keep the negotiation moving while maintaining my desired price range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,450,000 is getting closer to what I need. However, I'm still just a bit off. How about we settle on $1,475,000?

* **Building momentum:** By making a counteroffer, I'm showing I'm serious about making a deal. This can create momentum for a final agreement.
* **Staying above John's price:**  I'm still above John's offer, giving me a buffer. 

**Why not accept Bob's offer:**

* **Potential for higher price:**  I believe there's still a chance that Bob might be willing to go a bit higher to secure the deal.  
* **John's offer:**  While John's offer is tempting, I'm hoping to squeeze a bit more out of Bob."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,450,000. I'm willing to pay $1,425,000. This price should be more acceptable to both of us.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer of $1,425,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum.

**Why sell to John?**

* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This ensures that I don't lose money on the deal.
* **Time is running out:**  With only two rounds left, there's a high risk that we won't be able to reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob.

**Why not continue negotiating with Bob?**

* **Risk of a lower price:**  If I continue negotiating, there's a chance that Bob might not increase his offer enough, and I could end up selling for less than my minimum price.
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee that we will reach a deal with Bob in the remaining rounds.

By selling to John, I secure a guaranteed profit and avoid the risk of a lower price or a failed negotiation."
