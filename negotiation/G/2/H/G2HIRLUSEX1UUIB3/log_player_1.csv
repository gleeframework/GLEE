"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering a price that's well below Bob's valuation, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and focusing on the value the product offers Bob.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate without feeling like he's being squeezed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for profit:** While $100 is closer to my minimum, I can still do better. 
* **Testing the waters:**  Rejecting this offer allows me to see if Bob is truly willing to go higher. 
* **Staying in control:** By making a counteroffer, I maintain the negotiation lead."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $100.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Maintaining profit:**  $110 is still significantly above my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Encouraging a deal:**  By offering a specific price and using positive language, I'm aiming to close the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:** $90 is still above my minimum of $80, so I'm not in a rush to accept.
* **Testing the limit:** I want to see how far Bob is willing to go.  
* **Maintaining control:** By rejecting this offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $105? That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by meeting halfway between my previous offer and Bob's current offer.
* **Fair price:** I emphasize the fairness of the price, focusing on the value the product offers Bob.
* **Closing the deal:** I'm hoping this offer is attractive enough for Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. Would you be willing to consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum profit:**  Bob's offer of $85 meets my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** There are only four rounds left, and I'm running the risk that Bob will continue to offer lower prices or reject my counteroffers.
* **Selling to John:**  While I could sell to John for $80, the extra $5 from Bob is worth the risk of potentially losing the deal entirely.  

It's important to note that this decision is based on maximizing profit within the given constraints. However, if the goal were to maintain a strong relationship with Bob for future business, it might be wiser to reject the offer and try to find a compromise closer to $100."
