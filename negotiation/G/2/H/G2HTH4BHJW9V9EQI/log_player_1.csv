Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, leveraging the information about Bob's potential profit:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Knowing how much value you could derive from it, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This allows you to acquire it for significantly less than its value to you, while still providing a substantial return on my investment."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) without pushing him away. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially landing on a price that's still very favorable for you.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the profit Bob stands to make, making the offer more enticing.
* **Alternative in Mind:**  We know we have John as a backup, ensuring we won't be left empty-handed if Bob declines."
