**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has come down significantly and is hinting that this is her best offer.  While we could try to negotiate further, we're getting very close to her perceived value of the product, and she might walk away. A price of $9,200 is a good deal compared to John's offer of $12,000. It's better to secure the deal now rather than risk losing it and having to pay more."
