"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a lot to me, but I know it's also a valuable asset for your business. I'm starting with a price of $900,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. ",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below what this product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. Let's try $850,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value it brings to your business.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm offering $725,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of the product.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $725,000. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is closer to my minimum value. This leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let me know what you think.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up a bit from my previous offer, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be at least $800,000. This is a fair price given the value this product offers.  It's my final offer before I explore other options. ",800000.0,Alice,7,
