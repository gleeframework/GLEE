"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,000,000.  This is a considerable reduction on my part and reflects my willingness to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product holds value, but that price is still a bit out of reach for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. This demonstrates my serious interest while acknowledging my budget constraints.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I'm ready to make another adjustment. Let's settle this at $925,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end and is a firm offer.  I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's value.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be completely transparent, my absolute top limit for this product is $800,000. That's already a significant investment for me.  If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today.",800000.0,Bob,6,
