"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product.  Given its exceptional value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. My starting offer is $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the value I'm seeking, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly exceptional and my initial offer reflects that.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While I'm still interested,  $1,250,000 remains higher than my target. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1,125,000.  This shows my commitment to getting this deal done.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  It seems we're getting closer.  While I can't accept $1,125,000, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000. I believe this price point recognizes the product's true value while offering you a fair deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! I'm still not quite there at $1,200,000, but I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  Let's bridge the gap and get this deal finalized.  I'm genuinely interested in the product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you've been a great negotiator and I respect your commitment to finding a fair price.  I'm willing to make one final concession to close this deal.  How about we settle at $1,175,000? This represents a significant discount from my original offer and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",1175000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1,175,000 is tempting, I'm still just a bit over my target.  I'm prepared to pay $1,160,000. This would be a very reasonable compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalise this deal.",1160000.0,Bob,8,
