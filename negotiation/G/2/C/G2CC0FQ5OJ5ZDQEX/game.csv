"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product.  Let's try to find a middle ground here. ",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too far off from what this product is truly worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product for both of us, and I believe it's a fair solution.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
