"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I believe a starting price of $20,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is far too high.  It's important to bring the price down significantly in these early rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider something closer to $6,000."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:**  Starting with a low counter-offer can help gauge Alice's flexibility and establish a lower range early on. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason (""out of my budget"") can make the counter-offer seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $6,000 is significantly lower, it leaves space for counter-offers and finding a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below the product's value. Let's meet in the middle - how about $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Concession:** Alice is coming down in price, but very slowly.  The difference between her first two offers is much larger than the change she's offering now.
* **Still Above Budget:** $17,000 is still far above your $8,000 limit and too close to John's guaranteed price. 
* **Further Negotiation Needed:**  Continuing to negotiate might encourage Alice to make more substantial price reductions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $17,000 is still more than I'm willing to spend. To be honest, I'm considering another seller who has a similar product. If you're able to come down to $8,000, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  Making it clear that $8,000 is your maximum budget sets a firm boundary. 
* **Introducing Competition (John):** Mentioning another seller subtly increases the pressure for Alice to negotiate more seriously. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Suggesting you're ""ready to close the deal today"" adds a time constraint that might prompt a quicker response.
* **Going for the Goal:**  While risky, aiming directly for your target price of $8,000 might pay off if Alice is motivated to sell."
