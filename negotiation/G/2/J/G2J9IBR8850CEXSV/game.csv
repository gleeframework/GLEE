"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  How about $105? I think that's fair for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $105. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $115. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $110.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $110. I'll make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $112. It's the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",112.0,Alice,5,
