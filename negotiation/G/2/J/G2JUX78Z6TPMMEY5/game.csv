"I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you want to get a good price for your product, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but I don't think I can go any higher. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
