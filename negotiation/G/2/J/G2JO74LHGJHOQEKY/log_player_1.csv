Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $9,500 is a reasonable starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product.  It also invites Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* This offer aims to start the negotiation process at a point that is favorable to me.  
* By offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate, but I also establish a baseline for the negotiation.
*  If Bob rejects the offer, I'll be prepared to counter-offer, keeping in mind that my goal is to get as close to $10,000 as possible. However, I have the option to stop the negotiation and sell to John if Bob's counter-offers become too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is a bit tighter than that.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500?  I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my desired price.  I am willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price closer to my minimum threshold of $10,000. I believe I can improve upon Bob's offer by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This still gives you a great deal on a valuable product. Let's find a way to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer of $9,000 represents a compromise. It's significantly closer to my minimum threshold of $10,000 while still offering a price that's appealing to Bob.
* **Message:** The message continues to maintain a friendly and positive tone. I acknowledge Bob's offer but reiterate my belief that $9,000 is a fair price for both of us. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to create a sense of urgency by showing flexibility while still maintaining a price that's beneficial to me.
*  This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while keeping the focus on finding a mutually beneficial agreement.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to either make another counteroffer or consider selling to John if Bob's offers become unreasonable."
