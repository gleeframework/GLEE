"Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think would be a great asset to your business. I understand it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount considering its true value to me. It's a win-win situation, as you get a great deal and I can still secure a solid profit. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
