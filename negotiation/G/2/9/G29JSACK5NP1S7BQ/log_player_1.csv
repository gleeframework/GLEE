"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($120). This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, suggesting it's a good deal.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to see if Bob will accept the initial offer.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter with a lower price, but always keeping my minimum value ($150) in mind.  I'll also be monitoring the situation to see if I need to switch to John to ensure I get at least my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $130 is below my minimum price of $150. While it's tempting to take a quicker deal, I'm committed to maximizing my profit. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:** I can still make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I know I can get $150 from John if the negotiation with Bob falls apart.

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above my minimum. This will show Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is still a great price for such a valuable product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  While I rejected Bob's initial counteroffer, I'm demonstrating willingness to compromise by moving closer to his price.
* **Maintaining Margin:**  $135 is still above my minimum price of $150, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 

**Strategy:**

I believe this counteroffer balances my desire to maximize profit with the need to reach an agreement. If Bob still refuses, I'll be prepared to consider a final counteroffer before potentially switching to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $130 again? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $130 is still below my minimum price of $150, even though Bob is expressing genuine interest. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to take a few more rounds to see if I can get a better price.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my previous offer, aiming for a final price somewhere between $135 and $140. If Bob refuses, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John, as I've reached the point where further negotiation might not be productive."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I can't go any lower than $132.  This is a fair compromise that allows me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a great price on this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 132}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is my final attempt to meet Bob halfway. I'm dropping the price just a little further, but I'm confident this is the lowest I can go without compromising my minimum value.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I'm emphasizing the ""compromise"" aspect to encourage Bob to see the value in accepting this offer.
* **Direct Approach:** I'm using a direct and clear tone, making it clear that this is my best offer. 

**Strategy:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to sell to John in the next round.  I'm reaching the point where further negotiation might not be worth the risk of ending up with a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $131? That's the lowest I can go, but I really want this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $131. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $131
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value Breached:** Bob's offer of $131 is below my minimum value of $150. 
* **Limited Negotiation Space:** I've already made significant concessions, and it's unlikely Bob will go any higher. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay my minimum price.

**Strategy:**

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't secure a higher price from Bob, I'm not willing to sell the product below my minimum value.  Selling to John ensures I achieve my desired profit and avoids further unproductive negotiation with Bob."
