"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's value of $10,000. This means there's room for negotiation and Bob can potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $11,000, which is still a good deal for him as it's within his budget of $15,000. This offer is also closer to Alice's value of $10,000, increasing the likelihood of her accepting.  This strategy aims to find a middle ground that benefits both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than Bob's previous offer.  However, it's still lower than what Bob would pay John ($15,000). There's still room for negotiation, so Bob should continue to try and get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $11,500. This shows that he's willing to negotiate but still wants a price that's closer to his initial offer and lower than Alice's current offer.  This strategy aims to find a middle ground while still trying to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is getting close to Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. While Bob could continue to negotiate, the risk is that Alice will keep raising the price, eventually reaching a point where it's no longer advantageous to buy from her.  

Instead of continuing to negotiate and potentially getting stuck with a higher price, Bob decides to take the guaranteed deal with John for $15,000.  This ensures that Bob gets the product while remaining within his budget."
