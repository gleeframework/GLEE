"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know holds significant value for you.  I'm starting with a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point given the product's worth to both of us.  Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price. I'm prepared to sell the product for $850,000. This would still represent a significant gain for you, and it allows me to achieve a reasonable return on the product's value. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the effort I'm putting into acquiring it.",825000.0,Bob,4,
