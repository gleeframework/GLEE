"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe has immense potential.  While I can't disclose the exact details, I assure you it's worth at least $1200000 to me. I'm willing to let you purchase it for a price that reflects its value, but also allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Would you be interested in exploring a price of $1500000? This gives you a significant potential for return, and allows me to secure a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
