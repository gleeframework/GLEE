Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're pushing for a deal, and I'm ready to meet you halfway again.  I'm willing to accept $765,000 for the product. This is a very fair compromise, and I believe it's a good solution for both of us. Let's make this happen.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $765,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down considerably, and the price difference is getting smaller.  While you might be able to push for a slightly lower price, it's getting riskier.  Accepting the $765,000 offer guarantees a good deal without the risk of Alice backing out or the price going up in further rounds."
