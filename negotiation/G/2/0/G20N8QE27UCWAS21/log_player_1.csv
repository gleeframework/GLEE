"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the value of the product to Bob, justifying my initial high price. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I end with a question to encourage Bob to engage in a dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.** I won't accept a price that leaves me with less than $800,000.
* **There are still rounds left.** I'll counteroffer Bob, hoping to find a price closer to my desired value.
* **Selling to John is a backup:** While John offers a guaranteed $800,000, I'm willing to try and negotiate with Bob further before accepting that offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is unfortunately too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable drop:** I'm reducing my price from $900,000 to $850,000, showing flexibility while still maintaining a profit.
* **Focus on value:** I reiterate the product's worth to Bob, emphasizing that my price is still fair.
* **Collaborative approach:** I use language like ""work together"" and ""benefits both of us"" to create a sense of partnership and encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about $720,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and shows my commitment to reaching a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.**  $720,000 is not enough for me to sell the product.
* **I have rounds left to negotiate.**  There's still time to try and reach a more favorable price with Bob.
* **Selling to John is still a backup.**  While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $800,000, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $720,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $780,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and shows my desire to reach an agreement.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 780000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that is the midpoint between my last offer ($850,000) and Bob's offer ($720,000). This shows flexibility and a commitment to reaching a deal.
* **Emphasis on progress:** I highlight the reduction from my previous offer to emphasize my willingness to negotiate.
* **Urgency:** I use phrases like ""close this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept."

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.**  While $750,000 is closer, it's still not enough for me to sell the product. 
* **I have rounds left.** I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired $800,000.
* **Selling to John is still a backup.** While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $800,000, I'm not giving up on negotiating with Bob yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're pushing for a deal, and I'm ready to meet you halfway again.  I'm willing to accept $765,000 for the product. This is a very fair compromise, and I believe it's a good solution for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 765000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($780,000) and Bob's offer ($750,000). This shows flexibility and my commitment to finding a solution.
* **Emphasize fairness:** I use phrases like ""fair compromise"" and ""good solution for both of us"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage him to accept.
* **Urgency (again):** I use ""Let's make this happen"" to reiterate my desire to close the deal and motivate Bob to act."
