"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a game-changer in its industry and has the potential to revolutionize the way people live and work. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns on investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $950,000, which is a significant discount. I'll see if I can get a better price from John.
