"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider something closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still think $10,000 is a bit low. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500. This is my final offer, but I'm confident you'll see it's a fair price for the value this product brings.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I've thought about it, and I'm willing to meet you at $11,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm starting to think that's where we'll end up. Let's finalize the deal at this price.",11000.0,Alice,7,
