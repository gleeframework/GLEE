"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $600,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,000,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $700,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to be fair to myself as well.  $850,000 is my absolute lowest price. Let me know if this works for you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
