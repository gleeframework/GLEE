"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but I'm not comfortable with $1,100,000. I value the product at $800,000, and I'm willing to offer you $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's worth to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $975,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in acquiring the product.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's worth to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $925,000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility, but $925,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a firm offer, and I'm hoping we can find a way to close the deal at this price. ",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to budge on the price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my desired price.",950000.0,Alice,7,
