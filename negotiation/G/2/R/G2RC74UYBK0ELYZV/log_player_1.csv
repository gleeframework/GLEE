Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see some more flexibility on the price.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $900,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above a certain price point.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose $950,000. It's a fair price that still gives me a good deal, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on this price.

I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer. $950,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but I'm also seriously considering selling to John if we can't come to a better agreement with Bob."
