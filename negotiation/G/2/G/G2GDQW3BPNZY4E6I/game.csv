"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're getting closer to my desired price.  How about we split the difference at $10,150? This price is fair to both of us and would allow us to close the deal. What do you say?",10150.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still not at the price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is my initial offer. Can you meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,6,
