"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $175 for it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to give me room to negotiate.
* **Motivating Message:**  I'm framing the message to highlight the product's value, hoping to pique Bob's interest.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $175 is a starting point that leaves space for Bob to counteroffer and still allow me to potentially make a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and even below Bob's own valuation of $80. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's counteroffer indicates his interest.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer in the next round that aims for a price closer to my minimum.  

I'll proceed to the next round and attempt to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest! While $120 is a bit lower than I expected, I appreciate the offer. I'm willing to come down to $160.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer Closer to Minimum:** I've lowered my price to $160, which is closer to my minimum of $150.  
* **Show Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, which is important in building rapport. 
* **Maintain Margin:**  $160 still allows me to make a decent profit, but it's also closer to Bob's perceived value. 
* **Inviting Response:**  My message encourages Bob to respond and potentially agree to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $160. Can you meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Too Low:**  $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and also below Bob's own valuation of $80. This suggests he might be trying to get a bargain.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  I want to see if we can reach a price that's closer to my minimum, even if it means a few more rounds.
* **Risk of Selling to John:** While selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed deal, I believe there's a chance I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

I'll proceed to the next round and try to find a middle ground with Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I can't go as low as $130, I'm willing to drop my price to $145. This would still give you a good value, and it's closer to my minimum. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still above my minimum. This shows flexibility and willingness to meet halfway.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize that $145 is a ""good value"" for Bob, reminding him of the product's worth.
* **Focus on Minimum:** I subtly mention my minimum price, implying that further concessions are unlikely. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I encourage Bob to respond, hoping for a deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget at $145. Can you meet me at $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While $135 is closer to my minimum of $150, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Time is Running Out:** We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation, and each round brings us closer to the final round.
* **John's Offer is Safe:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** Further negotiation with Bob might result in a lower price than I'd like, potentially even below my minimum.

It's a tough decision, but considering the risk and time constraints, I'll accept John's offer to ensure I receive at least my minimum price for the product."
