"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $9,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice values the product at $8,000.  A counteroffer of $7,000 is still a good deal for you, and leaves room for negotiation. It's a reasonable starting point for the counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your initial offer of $7,000, it's still higher than you'd like to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and you can likely get a better price by making another counteroffer. Buying from John at $12,000 is a worse deal, so continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $9,500, so a counteroffer of $8,500 is a good compromise. It's closer to her offer and closer to your desired price point. This counteroffer is a reasonable middle ground that could lead to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,750 is getting very close to your maximum price of $12,000. There's a chance that if you reject and make a counteroffer, Alice will come back with a price that's too close to your limit for you to be comfortable with. It's better to secure the product from John at $12,000 and avoid the risk of a potentially unfavorable outcome with Alice."
