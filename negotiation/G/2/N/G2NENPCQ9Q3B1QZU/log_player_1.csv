"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm offering the product at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" to create a positive atmosphere and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I'm aware that Bob's value is lower, so this offer allows for several rounds of negotiation without immediately resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $8,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $12,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a higher price. I have 8 rounds left, and there's a good chance I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I need to make a bit more on this.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,000. It's still a great price for you, and it gives me a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm offering a price that's higher than Bob's but lower than my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Compromise:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""meeting in the middle"" to highlight the collaborative nature of the negotiation.
* **Positive Language:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great price"" for Bob to encourage him to see the value in my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. I would like to counter with $8,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is still below my minimum target of $12,000. I have 6 rounds left, and I'm hoping to secure a higher price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $8,500 is still too low for me. Let's try $9,500.  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Slight Concession:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $9,000 to $9,500.
* **Fair Compromise:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to accept it.
* **Progress Toward a Deal:** I'm emphasizing the importance of getting closer to a deal to put pressure on Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my position. I am unable to go above $8,500 for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is unwilling to budge from his $8,500 offer. I have 4 rounds left, and it seems unlikely he'll increase his offer significantly.  I've already made several concessions, and it's clear we're at an impasse. Given that John is willing to pay my minimum price of $12,000, selling to John is the best option at this point. It ensures I get my desired value and avoids further time-consuming negotiations with Bob."
