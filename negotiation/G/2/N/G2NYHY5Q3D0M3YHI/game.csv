"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $11,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to go up to $10,750, but I'm still not willing to go that low.
