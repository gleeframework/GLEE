"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired selling price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm confident that this product is worth significantly more than $850,000. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This price reflects the true value of the product while still providing you with a great deal.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $925,000.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while still allowing me to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
