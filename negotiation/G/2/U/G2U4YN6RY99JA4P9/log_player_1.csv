Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum of $80, leaving some room for negotiation, but also lower than Bob's perceived value of $150, giving him incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is a decent offer, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I will counteroffer and aim for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm sticking to my initial strategy of starting high and then slowly conceding. This offer is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer to $100. This is close to my minimum acceptable price and is a better offer than John's. I will accept this offer to maximize my profit."
