"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $10,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still committed to making this work.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,150?  It's a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired outcome.",10150.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference again and go with $10,025?  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer that demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement.",10025.0,Alice,7,
