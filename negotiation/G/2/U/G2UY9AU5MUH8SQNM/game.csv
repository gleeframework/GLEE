"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $12,750?",12750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. However, $12,750 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you consider $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,250. I can do $13,000, but that's as low as I can go.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to wrap this up.  Would you accept $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $11,750 is the right price for this product. I can meet you halfway between $11,750 and $13,000, which is $12,375. That's my final offer.",12375.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, you're really close.  I can do $12,000, and I think that's a fair compromise.  What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I still think the product is worth more than $12,000. I can do $12,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",12500.0,Alice,9,
