"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $7,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $8,000 to you. What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $7,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $7,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",7000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $7,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $6,500. Would that be agreeable to you?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting close to your target, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,000 and $6,500. How about we settle on $6,750? This is a fair price that still benefits both of us.",6750.0,Alice,5,
