This is too expensive.  Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $100.  This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but it's still a fair price for a product I value at $120.  Let's see if she's willing to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
