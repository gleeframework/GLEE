Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While we could continue negotiating, Bob has signaled that $950,000 is his final offer. Accepting this offer guarantees a substantial profit over our minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
