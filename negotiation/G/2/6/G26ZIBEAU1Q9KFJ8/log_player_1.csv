{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $850,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, hoping to secure a good deal. I'll adjust my offer based on his response, but I'm always prepared to walk away and sell to John for $800,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial proposal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $800,000? That's a fair price for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 800000}
