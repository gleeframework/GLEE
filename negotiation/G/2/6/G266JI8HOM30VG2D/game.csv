"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $11,000. This is a fair price that is close to your offer and within my budget.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",11000.0,Bob,4,
