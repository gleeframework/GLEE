"I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good deal. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $125, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $112.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $112.50 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll come down to $117.50.  This is a final offer, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",117.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $117.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $115, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",115.0,Bob,6,
