Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth, justifying the higher price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While I mention listing it publicly,  the fact that John exists gives me leverage. Bob knows I have other options if he declines.
* **Respectful Tone:** The message aims to be polite and professional, fostering a positive negotiation environment."
