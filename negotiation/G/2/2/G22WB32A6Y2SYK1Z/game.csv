"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer that's closer to what you're willing to pay. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $160. Is this more to your liking?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $120 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $140. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product offers.",140.0,Alice,5,
