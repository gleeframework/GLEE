"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  I believe it holds immense value, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000. I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I recognize the value of this product, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $800,000, which is the maximum I can pay. I'm confident this price represents a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and providing your perspective. While I understand your budget constraints, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, so to find a middle ground, I'll lower my price to $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still too high for me. Given our prior discussions, I'm firm on my previous offer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and my budget.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the value this product brings far surpasses your current offer.  I'm willing to make a significant move to demonstrate my desire to reach an agreement. My revised offer is $1,600,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my good faith in finding a mutually beneficial outcome.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, and $1,600,000 is a step in the right direction. However, it's still a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise given the value of the product and our respective needs. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued engagement in this negotiation. I appreciate you moving from your initial offer. While $1,000,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a significant gap from what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer that acknowledges our mutual desire to close a deal.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  While $1,350,000 is closer, it's still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I truly believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our desire to reach a deal.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
