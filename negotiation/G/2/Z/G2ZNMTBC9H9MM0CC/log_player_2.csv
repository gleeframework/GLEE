{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer from Alice is the best one yet, sitting right at your preferred maximum price. While you could counteroffer again, there is a risk that Alice might be unwilling to go lower and you could end up paying more or buying from John at $80.  Accepting at $85 ensures you get the product within your budget."
