"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the price of $1,750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits of the product.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but unfortunately, $1,250,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but $1,500,000 is my absolute minimum. This still offers you a significant value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down from your initial price, but $1,500,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,375,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it could bring to my business.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
