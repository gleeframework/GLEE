"I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiation so far.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best deal, but $950,000 just isn't working for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll be selling to someone else. Let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
