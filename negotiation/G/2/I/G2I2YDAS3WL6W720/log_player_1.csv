Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $150, he has a clear incentive to accept, but I'm still getting a good price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm willing to come down slightly from my previous offer, but I'm still confident that $135 is a fair price for both of us. Bob clearly wants the product, and this price is still above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $132, which is very close to my preferred price and well above my minimum.  It's not worth risking further negotiation for the small potential gain.  I'll take the deal and sell to Bob."
