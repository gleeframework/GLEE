"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. While I can't disclose details about its exact worth, I can assure you it's something special. I'm offering it to you for $20000, which is a fair price considering its potential. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss further. Otherwise, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is $20,000, which is more than your maximum budget of $10,000.  Since you can buy the product from John for $10,000, rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice."
