"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely do better.  He's willing to pay up to $1,000,000, so there's room for negotiation. By rejecting, Bob can explore if he can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  He starts with a significant counteroffer of $900,000, which is still within his budget. This is a good starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $925,000, which is a good price for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $1,000,000.  While he could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might not budge further or that he might lose the deal altogether.  Accepting the offer is the most logical choice, ensuring a good deal and saving $75,000 compared to buying from John."
