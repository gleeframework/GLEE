# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire a product that's worth a significant amount to you. I understand its value to you is $1,000,000, and I'm willing to part with it for a price that reflects its worth.  Consider this offer:  [Product Price] 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is too high. You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no need to pay $950,000. By rejecting the offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better price."
