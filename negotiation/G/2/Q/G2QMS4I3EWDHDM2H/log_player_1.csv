"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to make a sale, I'm not willing to accept a price that's below my minimum value. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,750,000, which is still significantly higher than my minimum but shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. This should hopefully entice Bob to come closer to my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not acceptable. I will counteroffer in the next round to try and push him further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,600,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise, while still remaining above my minimum value. I hope this will encourage Bob to accept, as we are nearing a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum value, I'm running out of time, and I'm concerned he will not increase his offer enough to meet my needs. I don't want to risk further negotiation and losing out on a sale altogether. Selling to John guarantees me a price that meets my minimum requirement, and it's a more secure option at this point."
