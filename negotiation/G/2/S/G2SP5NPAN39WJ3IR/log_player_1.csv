Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant opportunity for you."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, it's always better to aim higher if possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000. We need to offer a price significantly lower than our guaranteed sale price but still high enough that Bob might find it a good deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It allows us to potentially meet somewhere in the middle while still exceeding our minimum.

This strategy balances the risk of losing Bob with the potential for a higher profit than our guaranteed sale to John."
