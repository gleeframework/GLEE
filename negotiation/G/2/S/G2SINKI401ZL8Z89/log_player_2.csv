You should reject Alice's offer again. While it's closer to your target, you can still try to get a better price.  You're still willing to pay up to $800,000, and it's worth continuing to negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, so I'll meet you at $900000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

While Alice is getting closer to your desired price, it's still above your target of $800,000.  You've already made multiple counteroffers, and it seems unlikely Alice will go lower. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John. You'll save $100,000 compared to Alice's offer."
