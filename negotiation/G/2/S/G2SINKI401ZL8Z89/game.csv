"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value we both see in it.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $920000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",920000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $920000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, so I'll meet you at $900000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,
