Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm still trying to push Bob a bit higher. I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet, as I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob for a bit closer to my ideal price."

We've reached a point where it's clear Bob is unlikely to budge further.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price of $1,200,000, which is much better than the $925,000 offer from Bob.  It's time to move on to the guaranteed deal."
