"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can likely negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $11,000? It's still a good value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to his goal of $10,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. How about $10,900? That's a fair price for both of us. It's a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my asking price. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's goal:** $10,900 is only $200 more than Bob's last counteroffer of $10,750. 
* **Continuing negotiation might not be worth it:** With only 5 rounds remaining, continuing to negotiate might not lead to a significantly better deal.
* **Avoiding John's higher price:**  Accepting Alice's offer is significantly cheaper than buying from John for $12,000.

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob gets a good price while ensuring he doesn't run out of time to negotiate and end up with a worse deal from John."
