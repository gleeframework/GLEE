Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $11,500 is above your minimum of $10,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The price is below Bob's perceived value, leaving room for him to counteroffer.
* **It's a strong starting point:**  By offering a slightly higher price, you show confidence in your product's value. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, so be prepared to counteroffer if Bob's counteroffer isn't acceptable.  You can also use this first offer to gauge Bob's interest and adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $12,000 to you.  Let's see if we can finalize this. "", ""product_price"": 11000}
