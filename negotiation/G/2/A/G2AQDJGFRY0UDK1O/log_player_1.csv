Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price of $800,000.
* **Strong Starting Point:**  $1,200,000 is a significant amount above your minimum, giving you room to potentially negotiate down while still securing a substantial profit.
* **Respectful Offer:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value to Bob and presenting the price as a starting point for discussion. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  It's unknown how much Bob is *willing* to pay, only how much he *values* the product. 
* **Negotiation:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a negotiation strategy in place beforehand is crucial."
