"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit.  However, I'm also being mindful of the fact that I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not overly aggressive in this first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my target price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $7,000? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While we're getting closer, $7,000 is still too low.  I'm confident I can get a better price, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,000 is still too far below my minimum. Let's try $8,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to keep my profit margin while ensuring you get a great product. I'm open to hearing any other suggestions you might have."", ""product_price"": 8000}
