Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a fair price here. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,000,000 is too low.  How about we settle at $1,500,000? This is my absolute bottom line. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to her bottom line of $1,500,000. This is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice. You can get the product for a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, which is the best possible outcome for you."
