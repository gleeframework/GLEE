Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected. I want to see if Bob is interested in negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for that low, but I'm also not willing to risk selling to John for that price. I'm going to see if I can get more from Bob by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm offering $12,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a price closer to my desired value."
