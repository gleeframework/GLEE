"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to meet me at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can do $137.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",137.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to make another concession. However, $137.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $132 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",132.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make another small concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can do $135. Is that a price you'd be willing to pay?",135.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, Alice, but I still think $135 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",130.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've given you a lot of room to negotiate, Bob, and I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on the deal. I can do $133.50. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",133.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final concession, Alice, but I'm afraid $133.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $120.",130.0,Bob,10,
