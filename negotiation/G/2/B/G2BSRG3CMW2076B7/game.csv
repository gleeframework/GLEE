"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value you've mentioned.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I appreciate your perspective on the value.  While $950,000 is a strong offer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000. This reflects the significant value and potential we've discussed.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me, though.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering both our needs. Let's see if we can come to an agreement here.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
