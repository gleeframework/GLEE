"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Even though Alice's offer is slightly lower than her initial value, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  It makes the most sense to go with the guaranteed lower price."
