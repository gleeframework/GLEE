Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a high opening offer, aiming to gauge Bob's interest and potentially leave room for negotiation.  However, it's still significantly lower than the product's value to me, leaving me with a substantial profit even if Bob accepts the first offer.  If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe there's potential for a higher price. I will counteroffer and see if I can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

This counteroffer represents a compromise. I'm dropping my price, acknowledging Bob's low offer, but still aiming for a higher price than the minimum I'm willing to accept. I believe this offer is reasonable and might persuade Bob to reach a deal closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a good deal. While I initially aimed for a higher price, it's now a significant profit compared to selling to John for $1,000,000.  Continuing negotiations might lead to a slightly higher price, but the risk of Bob walking away and me having to settle for John's offer outweighs the potential gain."
