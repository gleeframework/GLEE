Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my potential profit and minimizing the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. 

Here's why:

* **Profit:** If Bob accepts, I make a profit of $15.
* **Risk:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell the product to John for $100, which is my minimum acceptable price. 

This offer is likely to be attractive to Bob, as he values the product at $120. He can save $5 by buying from me, and I can earn more than my minimum desired price."
