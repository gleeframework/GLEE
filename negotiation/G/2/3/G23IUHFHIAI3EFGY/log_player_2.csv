"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Not Too Low:** While I start low, $6,500 is still a reasonable amount above my absolute limit ($8,000 from John). This shows Alice I'm serious but also trying to get a price that works for me. 
* **Polite and Professional:** Maintaining a positive tone encourages continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $6,500. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $8,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has met my bottom line. There's no point in rejecting and potentially losing the deal, as John's offer is also $8,000."
