"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product, given its value to me. I believe this is a fair price, considering the potential benefits.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,500. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, considering the value you place on the product.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $16,500 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $14,000, which is a significant step closer to my initial offer.  I'm confident we can close this deal at this price, considering the value of this product to me.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $15,750. This is a reasonable price considering the value you place on the product and the value I place on it.",15750.0,Alice,5,
