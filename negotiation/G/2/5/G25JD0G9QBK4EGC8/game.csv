"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me halfway?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit low for me.  How about $130? That's a fair compromise, and still leaves some room for both of us to be happy.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $127.50? That's the best I can do.,127.5,Bob,4,
