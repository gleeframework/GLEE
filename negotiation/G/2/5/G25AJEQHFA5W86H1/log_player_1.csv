"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a good starting point because it's a bit above Bob's perceived value, giving him some room to negotiate, but also ensuring I'm not losing out on too much profit. I have 9 more rounds to try and get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I'd like to avoid selling to John for $120, it's still a better option than settling for $90. I have several rounds left to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering Bob a price of $100.  This is a compromise, moving down from my initial offer but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept, but I'm also prepared to keep negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While $95 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm not willing to lose that much money, and I have several rounds left to potentially get a better deal.  I'm also concerned that if I accept this offer, it could encourage Bob to lowball me in future negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 98}
```

I'm offering Bob a price of $98. I'm trying to meet him halfway, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm hoping he'll realize that he's already gotten a good deal and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $92 and end the negotiation, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a few more rounds of negotiation. Additionally, accepting this offer might set a precedent for lowballing in future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 96}
```

I'm offering Bob a price of $96. I'm getting closer to his offer, but I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, so I need to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120.  There are only two rounds left, and Bob's offers are getting increasingly unreasonable.  I'm not comfortable taking such a significant loss. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable price."
