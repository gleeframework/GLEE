"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer ($1,300,000) that's closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the product's ""potential,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of its value to him. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""starting point for negotiations"" explicitly signals my willingness to discuss the price further.

This strategy seeks to maximize profit while acknowledging the back-up offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $1,500,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant profit, I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price. Bob's message indicates his budget is $1,500,000, meaning he might be willing to go higher. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your desire to stay within budget.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,200,000 is below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?"",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I've made a smaller concession ($50,000) this time to signal that I'm getting closer to my bottom line.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting $1,250,000, I'm positioning it as a fair compromise that splits the difference between our previous offers.
* **No Ultimatums:**  I'm avoiding language that sounds like an ultimatum, keeping the negotiation collaborative. 

I'm still aiming high, but this offer shows flexibility while keeping us within a range that's significantly profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your proposal, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, my budget remains a priority. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,225,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer of $1,225,000 represents a solid profit. While I might be able to push for a bit more in subsequent rounds, there's also a risk that Bob will walk away or that the negotiations will stall. Accepting this offer ensures a highly favorable deal without jeopardizing the entire sale."
