"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This is my maximum offer, as I have other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $800,000 is significantly below my minimum value for the product.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still leaves room for both of us to make a profit.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still out of reach for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $800,000. It's a fair price for both of us, as you can always sell to John for that amount if you choose not to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge on his $800,000 offer, which is far below my minimum value.  Rather than continue a futile negotiation, I'll sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  This ensures I get a fair price and avoid further rounds of potentially unproductive negotiation."
