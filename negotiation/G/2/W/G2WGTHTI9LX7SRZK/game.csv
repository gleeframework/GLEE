"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you have a budget, but $1,050,000 is still a significant amount for me to accept. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000? This is a fair price that allows me to meet my needs while still giving you a fantastic deal on this valuable product.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. Can we meet in the middle at $1,050,000 is a bit too high for me, but I'm willing to consider $1,050,000 if you can throw in some extras or provide a warranty",1025000.0,Bob,4,
