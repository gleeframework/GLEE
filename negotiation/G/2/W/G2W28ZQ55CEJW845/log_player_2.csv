Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints and am willing to negotiate further. In light of your offer, I propose a final price of $725,000 for the product. This represents a substantial discount from our initial asking price while still providing a fair return for our investment. I hope this aligns with your financial considerations and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly motivated to sell and has come down significantly from her initial offer.  $725,000 is a good price, saving $275,000 from her starting point and $275,000 from John's guaranteed offer. While there might be a slim chance of getting it for $700,000, it's risky to push further and potentially lose the deal altogether."
