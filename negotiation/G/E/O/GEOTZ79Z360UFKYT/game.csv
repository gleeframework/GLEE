"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate the value of this product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000.  I feel this is a fair starting point that acknowledges the product's value while reflecting my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $950,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $950,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you consider $875,000?  It keeps us moving towards a potential deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get the price down, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close.  I can see you're firm on your price, but I'm also trying to be responsible with my budget. My final offer is $900,000. If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'll make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $925,000, but I'll throw in some additional features that will increase the product's value to you. This is my final offer. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,7,
