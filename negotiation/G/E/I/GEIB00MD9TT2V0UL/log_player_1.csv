Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $120 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $120 is significantly more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $150, so he has room to negotiate and still get a good deal.
* **It's inviting negotiation:** The message makes it clear that you're open to discussing the price. This encourages Bob to counteroffer, allowing you to potentially reach a higher price. 

By starting with this offer, you maximize your chances of earning a good price while keeping the negotiation open and engaging."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than $80, it's still significantly less than your starting offer of $120.  You have room to negotiate further with Bob, so rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate.  While $100 is a good price, it's a bit lower than what I was hoping for. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

Here's why this counteroffer is a good strategy:

* **It's a compromise:** You're meeting Bob halfway, showing you're willing to negotiate.
* **It's still above your minimum:** $110 is still more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's persuasive:** The message highlights the benefits of the deal for both parties. 

By offering $110, you increase your chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price without risking losing the sale entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $105. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Here's why accepting Bob's offer is the best choice:

* **Close to your desired price:** $105 is just $5 away from your previous counteroffer of $110, making it a reasonable compromise.
* **Better than selling to John:**  You'll earn $25 more by selling to Bob than you would by selling to John.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or Bob walking away entirely, jeopardizing the sale. 

While you might be able to push for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer minimizes risk and ensures a sale that's significantly more profitable than selling to John."
