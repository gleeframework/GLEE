Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $100, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering the product for $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80 but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This allows for some bargaining space and encourages Bob to counteroffer.
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and the ""great deal"" to entice Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think the product is really interesting, but I was hoping to get a better deal. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is a step closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for a higher price:**  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, especially if I counteroffer strategically. 
* **Avoiding a loss:**  Selling to John guarantees $120, but I'm confident I can get closer to that amount by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $85 is tempting, I'm looking for something a bit closer to my asking price. How about $95? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  $95 is still a good deal for Bob (higher than his value but lower than my minimum), and it shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and remaining polite, while still emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  This counteroffer leaves a little more room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $85. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $90 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While I could potentially get a slightly higher price, there's a risk Bob might become even more hesitant or walk away entirely.
* **Time and effort:** Continuing to negotiate might take more time and effort, and ultimately, $90 is a good profit. 
* **Certainty of a sale:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and avoids the potential for a failed negotiation."
