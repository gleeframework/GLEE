Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""value"" and offering a pre-public sale, you're creating a sense of exclusivity and desirability. 
* **Leaving Room:** While the price is above Bob's perceived value, it's not so high as to be insulting. It leaves space for him to counter-offer, leading to a potential agreement.

**Important Note:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed buyer in John at $10,000, ensuring you meet your minimum selling price."
