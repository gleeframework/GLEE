"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to consider $12000?  I'm genuinely interested in the product and believe this price is fair given its value.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer! I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $13500. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,
