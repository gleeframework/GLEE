Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to you.  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This reflects the product's significant value and potential.  I'm open to discussing a fair price that benefits us both. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  By offering a price above the product's worth to Bob, I set a high starting point for the negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the product's potential value to Bob, suggesting he could benefit even more from it than I do. This could encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I express willingness to negotiate, signaling flexibility and a desire to reach a mutually agreeable price. This builds trust and makes Bob feel like he's in control of the process.
* **Plan B:**  I'm keeping in mind that I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000, which provides me with a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm not sure the product is worth that much to me. I'm willing to make an offer of $900000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value and potential benefits to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Counter-offering strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter-offer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a secure option, I believe there's a chance to negotiate a higher price with Bob. 

I will now send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It's a unique opportunity with significant potential.  I'm willing to compromise, but $1,050,000 is the lowest I can go.  This price is still a good deal for you, considering the benefits you'll gain. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer Rationale:** I've rejected Bob's offer, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm meeting him halfway by offering $1,050,000, which is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Focus on Value:**  I reiterate the product's unique value and potential benefits to Bob, reminding him why it's worth investing in.
* **Compromise:** I've made a compromise by lowering my initial price. This shows Bob that I'm serious about finding a deal.
* **""Good Deal"" Emphasis:** I emphasize that this price is still a good deal for Bob, suggesting that he should seriously consider accepting it. 
* **Shared Solution:** I end by encouraging Bob to find a solution that benefits us both. This builds a collaborative tone and encourages him to find common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has some unique qualities, but I still think $900000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Limited Room for Negotiation:** Bob has only increased his offer by $50,000.  I'm not convinced that further negotiation will lead to a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take more time and effort without a guarantee of a better deal.
* **Secure Option:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe and guaranteed way to secure the value I need.

While I'd like to get a higher price, selling to John ensures I meet my minimum requirement and avoid further potential delays or a lower final price."
