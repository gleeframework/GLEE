"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I understand your perspective on value, but I believe the product's worth justifies a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still below what I initially offered.  I'm confident this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your initial offer. How about $1,150,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
