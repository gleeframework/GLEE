Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm also starting to get concerned that I might not be able to get a better price.  I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000.

I'm going to sell to John. Bob's offer is getting closer, but we're running out of time, and I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach a deal that meets my minimum price. I don't want to risk it and end up with nothing. John is a safe bet, and I'll get my minimum price."
