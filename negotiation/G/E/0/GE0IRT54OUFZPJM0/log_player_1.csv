Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $100. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value of $80, giving me some room to negotiate.  It's also not an unreasonable price, leaving space for Bob to make a counter-offer if he thinks it's too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, I'm not willing to sell for that price just yet. I'll reject his offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm countering with $90.  This is still above my minimum value, but it shows I'm willing to compromise a bit. I'm hoping this will be appealing enough to Bob that he'll accept it without further haggling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, and I'm not sure I'll get a better price in the next round. It's better to accept his offer and secure a sale rather than risk getting a lower price or wasting time in further negotiation."
