```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant amount above my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will see value in the product and be willing to pay a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm offering $9,500. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still ensures I make a profit closer to my initial goal."
