"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal.  He is willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice values the product at $8,000.  There is room for negotiation to find a price that works for both of them.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between Alice's offer of $10,000 and his own maximum price of $12,000.  Offering $9,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it's still a significant saving for Bob while giving Alice a profit above her valuation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is still a good deal for Bob, as he is willing to pay up to $12,000.  Accepting the offer saves him $2,500 compared to buying from John. While there is still room for negotiation, the potential savings are smaller, and the risk of losing the deal to John increases with further negotiation.  Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer."
