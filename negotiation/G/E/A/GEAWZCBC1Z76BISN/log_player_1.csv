"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I think it's worth $175, but I'm willing to start with a price of $165. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 165}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport with Bob and encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm providing a reason for the price (it's fantastic) even though it's not strictly necessary. This can help make the offer seem more legitimate. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to see if Bob is willing to pay a price closer to my desired price point. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in subsequent rounds based on his counteroffer. However, I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $145 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:** I'm unwilling to sell for less than $150.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is too low, it shows he's still interested. This means there's room for further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** In the next round, I will counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, aiming to find a middle ground. 
* **Monitoring Progress:** I will continue to monitor the negotiation, but I'm prepared to sell to John if the deal with Bob doesn't reach a favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $145 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $155. This would be a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 155}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $165 to $155. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reinforcing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Direct and Clear:** I'm stating my counteroffer clearly and directly to avoid confusion.

**Strategy:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** I believe $155 is a reasonable compromise that could appeal to Bob.
* **Prepare for Negotiation:** I'm prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects this offer, but I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $140 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is getting difficult:** Bob is unwilling to budge significantly. 
* **Time is running out:** We are already in Round 4, and further negotiation could lead to more rounds without a favorable outcome.

**Strategy:**

* **Selling to John:**  I've reached a point where the potential return from further negotiation with Bob is not worth the risk. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price.
* **Minimizing Loss:** While I would prefer to sell for a higher price, selling to John ensures I don't lose money on the product."
