Alice's starting price is too high. It's closer to my maximum budget than it is to her value. There's room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:

Alice is coming closer to her actual value, but there's still room for negotiation. We're getting into a range where it might make sense to accept soon, though, to avoid the risk of losing the deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to give up on the price just yet, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $8,100. It's the best I can do. What do you think?

Alice is clearly trying to hold on to as much profit as possible, and while I could try to negotiate further, the difference is getting small. Accepting at $8,100 gets me the product for a decent amount less than my maximum budget."
