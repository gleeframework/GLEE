Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

I will reject Bob's offer. $100 is too low, and I can potentially get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 
I'm willing to come down to $150. This is still a good price for me, and I hope Bob will find it reasonable."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $110 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counter-offer again."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm reducing my price to $130.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I hope it's enough to get Bob to agree. I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price."
