"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this amazing product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably spend.  I'm happy to go up to $10,000 for the product, which is the absolute maximum I can offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but that's as low as I can go. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out on this price.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, and I really want this product.  However, I'm still at my absolute limit of $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's my maximum and still allows you to make a profit.  Would you be willing to reconsider and accept this final offer?",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're really serious about the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already told you I won't go below $10,500, and I'm not willing to budge from that price. I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product, and I'm starting to consider other options. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer: $10,600. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other opportunities.",10600.0,Alice,7,
