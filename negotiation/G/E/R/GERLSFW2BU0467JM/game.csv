"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer you $900,000.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still too low for me. It's a great product and I'm confident it's worth more.  I'm willing to come down a bit more and offer it to you for $1,000,000. That's a significant discount from my original price and a great opportunity for you. Let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering my budget and the product's value. Let's reach a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering the product for $975,000. This is a fair price, and I think it's a deal we can both be happy with.  Let's finalize this.",975000.0,Alice,5,
