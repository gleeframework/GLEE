"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly unique. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. It's in your best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $800,000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to discussing that price."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget.  You should reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's still room for compromise, and you might be able to get closer to your desired $800,000 price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm really only able to go up to $900,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you can see the value in the product and meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above your budget.  At this point, it's clear that Alice is unwilling to go much lower.  It's more advantageous to buy from John for $800,000, as you've reached a point where further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to lead to a price within your budget."
