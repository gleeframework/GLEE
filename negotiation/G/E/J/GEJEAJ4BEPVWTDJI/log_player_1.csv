"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest. It's likely he'll counteroffer, giving us room to negotiate. If he doesn't, I can still accept John's offer for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I believe there's still room for a higher price. I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500} 
```

I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $1,000 more than John's offer, and we're already on round 4. Accepting his offer is the most sensible option as we are getting a better price and are getting closer to a deal."
