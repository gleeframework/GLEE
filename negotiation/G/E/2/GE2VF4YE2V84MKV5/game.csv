"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe holds immense value for someone like you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe it's a fair price, given the market value and my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While $1,500,000 is tempting, I'm confident in the product's value exceeding that.  How about we settle on $1,650,000?  This reflects the value while acknowledging your initial offer.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,500,000 and $1,650,000, which would be $1,575,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank. What do you think?",1575000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Your points are valid, and I'm willing to come down slightly further. How about $1,600,000?  This feels like a solid compromise that acknowledges the product's value while being mindful of your budget.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $1,575,000, but no higher. I think this is a fair price that balances the product's value with my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",1575000.0,Bob,6,
