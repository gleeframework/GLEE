"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $100. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $175? That would still give you a good deal.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm happy to go to $150.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",150.0,Bob,4,
