Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $120 as possible, as that's her guaranteed profit with John.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $100, offering it slightly below $120 might entice him. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  While this is a single offer scenario, the slightly lower price leaves a small window for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal, even though it's just below Alice's minimum. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $119. If Alice wants to ensure a sale, she should offer it for $100 (or slightly above), but that would mean less profit."
