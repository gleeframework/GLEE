Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and appreciate the compromise you've made. However, I've carefully considered my budget, and to be frank, $900,000 is just beyond what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to make one final offer of $775,000.  This represents a significant stretch for me, but I believe it's a fair offer that allows both of us to benefit. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options, but I hope we can close this deal.

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offer increments are relatively small. It's unlikely he'll reach a price close enough to your $1,200,000 baseline in the remaining rounds. Accepting his final offer of $775,000 would result in a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed offer. At this point, it's more profitable to cut negotiations short and sell to John."
