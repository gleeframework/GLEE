Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,450,000. This is a good starting point for negotiation. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for bargaining. It also keeps me close to my minimum acceptable price while leaving room for potential concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's well below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to sell for that low. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,350,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, showing my willingness to negotiate. However, it's still a price that is above Bob's offer and closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is still too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to drop my price that much. I've already made significant concessions and I'm not comfortable going lower. It's better to sell to John at my minimum acceptable price than to continue negotiating with Bob and risk getting an even lower offer."
