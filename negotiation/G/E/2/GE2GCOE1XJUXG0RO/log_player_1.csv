"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  $800,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 simply isn't viable for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1700000 is closer, I'm still unable to go that high. My maximum offer remains $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and my budget constraints.  I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm concerned that we won't be able to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value and saves me further negotiation."
