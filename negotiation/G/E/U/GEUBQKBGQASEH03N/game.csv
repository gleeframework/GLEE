"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more than $10,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $10,500 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. How about $10,200?  That would work much better for me.",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,200 is still a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $10,400. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10400.0,Alice,5,
