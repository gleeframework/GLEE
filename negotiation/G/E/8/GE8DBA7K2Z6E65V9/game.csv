"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a fair and competitive offer. I'll sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is likely much higher. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $825,000 is still pushing it for me.  How about we settle at $725,000? That's a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $725,000 is still a bit too high for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $775,000. This is a very good price, considering the product's value to you. I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, so I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're invested in this, and I appreciate the concessions you've made. To be completely transparent, my absolute limit is $750,000. If you're willing to meet me there, we have a deal.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your limit, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $765,000.
