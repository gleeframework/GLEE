"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit,  but I need to make at least $10,500 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it's a price I can accept. ",10250.0,Alice,3,
