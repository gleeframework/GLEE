"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000.  I believe this is reflective of its worth and potential return on investment for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget of $8,000. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. Given the value you've stated, I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product. This reflects a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I'm motivated to sell,  $8,500 is cutting it a bit too close to my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This reflects the value it holds and allows me to feel comfortable with the agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $10,000 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still above what I'm able to comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 9000}
