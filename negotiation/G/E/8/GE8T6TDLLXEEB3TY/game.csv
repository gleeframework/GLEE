"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000.  I believe this is reflective of its worth and potential return on investment for you. Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. Given the value you've stated, I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product. This reflects a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I'm motivated to sell,  $8,500 is cutting it a bit too close to my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This reflects the value it holds and allows me to feel comfortable with the agreement.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still above what I'm able to comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",9000.0,Bob,4,
