Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try and negotiate a better price with Bob."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  While I'd like to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer is still too low.  John's offer is a guaranteed sale and meets my minimum requirement."
