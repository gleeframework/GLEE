{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation. I'll see if Bob is willing to pay this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While I'm happy to sell to John for $100, I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $110. This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, Bob will find this price acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge from his price, and I've already lowered my price twice.  At this point, it's more efficient to sell to John. I'll be getting my minimum acceptable price, and I can move on to other business."
