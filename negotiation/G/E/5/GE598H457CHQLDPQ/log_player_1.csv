Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate, while still being significantly above my minimum value. I'll see if he's interested in this price first, before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'd prefer to try and get a bit more.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, and I want to see if I can get Bob to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I think it might be appealing to him.  I'm hoping this will be enough to get him to budge."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $13,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum and a good compromise.  There's no guarantee that Bob will come up further, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  It's better to get $13,000 now than to potentially end up with nothing."
