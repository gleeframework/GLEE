"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,200,000 from John.  Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is a good start, but there's room for negotiation to potentially save more money.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter-offer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $900,000 represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This shows Alice that you are serious about getting a good deal and are willing to negotiate. It's a reasonable starting point that allows for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good deal, considering your maximum budget is $1,200,000 and John is selling for that price.  You've already negotiated a $50,000 reduction from her initial offer, so it's a good time to accept.  There's a chance you could negotiate further, but the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and you having to pay full price to John outweighs the potential savings."
