Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John is guaranteed to buy the product for $10,000, Alice should aim to get that amount from Bob if possible. This maximizes her potential profit. 
* **Strong Opening:**  Starting at Bob's maximum perceived value leaves room for negotiation if needed, but also establishes a strong initial position. 
* **Exclusivity:**  By framing the offer as ""exclusive,"" Alice adds a subtle psychological pressure point, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept before he ""misses out."" 

**Important Note:** While Alice has a backup buyer, there's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. If Alice wants to ensure a sale, she could offer a lower price, but it would come at the cost of potential profit."
