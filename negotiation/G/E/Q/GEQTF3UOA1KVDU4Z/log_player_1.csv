"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired selling point. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justify the Price:** By emphasizing the product's ""value and potential,"" I aim to anchor Bob's perception at a higher level, even if the initial price is above his perceived value.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The $1,500,000 starting point leaves space for potential counteroffers while still remaining significantly above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his perceived value, leaving us no room for negotiation.  While it's tempting to accept $1,000,000, we have options:

1. **John as Leverage:**  We have a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, giving us a strong bargaining position.
2. **Early Stages:**  It's only round 2. Rejecting Bob's offer signals we're serious about a higher price and encourages him to move closer to our range.

By rejecting, we incentivize Bob to improve his offer without losing the security of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects the true worth of what's on offer."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're coming down from $1,500,000 to $1,350,000, a significant drop designed to show flexibility and encourage Bob to reciprocate.
* **Holding Firm:** While showing movement, we remain well above Bob's offer and our minimum ($1,200,000), reinforcing the product's value.
* **Justification:** We reiterate the product's worth, subtly reminding Bob that settling for his initial price would be a missed opportunity.

This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation forward while keeping us within a comfortable profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching Our Minimum:** Bob's offer now precisely matches our minimum acceptable price and what John is offering. 
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:**  While potentially a bluff, Bob's statement suggests he's unlikely to go higher. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging negotiations has diminishing returns. Accepting now secures a good price without risking further back-and-forth.

While we could push for slightly more, the potential gains are outweighed by the risks of losing Bob and having to settle for the same amount from John."
