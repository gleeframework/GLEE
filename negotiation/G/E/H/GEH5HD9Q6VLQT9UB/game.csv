"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and exclusive opportunity to purchase a rare and valuable item. I'm thinking of a price of $1200000 for the product. Is this something you'd be interested in?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the rarity of this item, $1200000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $900000, which is still a significant investment and reflects the value I see in the product. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this unique item. What are your thoughts on this revised price?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1000000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference and go with $950000. It's a fair price, and it allows me to move forward with the purchase.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is still a bit lower than my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I can meet you at $980000. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,5,
