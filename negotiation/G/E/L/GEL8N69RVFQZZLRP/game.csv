"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $900,000 is closer to our starting point,  I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to lower my price to $950,000. This allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
