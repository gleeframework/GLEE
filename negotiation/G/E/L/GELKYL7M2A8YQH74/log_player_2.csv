"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice.  You can likely get a better price than $1,350,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down slightly, how about $1,275,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

Alice has come down to $1,275,000, which is a good price, but still leaves you some room to save.  It's much better than buying from John and it's likely Alice won't budge much further."
