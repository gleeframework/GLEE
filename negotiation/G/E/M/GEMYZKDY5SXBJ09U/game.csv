"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, how about $9,000? This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my value for the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you meet me at that price?",8000.0,Bob,4,
