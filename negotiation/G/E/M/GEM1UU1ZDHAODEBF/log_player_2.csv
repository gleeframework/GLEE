Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

# Alice's message: I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $1,075,000, which is a compromise between my minimum price and your offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my need to sell it quickly.
