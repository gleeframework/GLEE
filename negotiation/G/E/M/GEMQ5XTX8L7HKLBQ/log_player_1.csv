"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  I can still make a good profit selling to John if needed, but I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
``` 

I'm going to drop the price a bit to 140.  This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully, it's enticing enough for Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While $130 is better than his previous offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer $135. This is a small compromise, but I'm hoping it will be enough to convince him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not the ideal price I wanted, it's better than John's offer and we're getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds.  There's always a risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer in the next round, and potentially leading to a lower price.  This seems like the best way to guarantee a decent profit."
