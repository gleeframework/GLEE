"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $120. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal, you can potentially get a better price by counteroffering. You are willing to pay up to $150, so there is room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $120 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100. Would you be willing to come down a bit? "", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $100, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can meet you in the middle at $110. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $110 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer of $120 and closer to your desired price of $100.  Accepting the offer saves you $40 compared to buying from John."
