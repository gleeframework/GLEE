"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is a significant drop from my initial proposal. This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a competitive price, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  $825,000 is too low for me to consider. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's true worth.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",800000.0,Bob,6,
