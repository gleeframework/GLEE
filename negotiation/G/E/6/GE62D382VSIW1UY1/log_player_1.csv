"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This sets a strong starting point for negotiation and allows room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,400,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,600,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintain a price point that's closer to my value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,350,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,550,000. This is getting closer to my minimum value, but I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob since he's clearly interested in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting too low, and I'm getting close to my minimum value.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing: selling to John for $1,500,000.  This ensures I get my minimum value and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
