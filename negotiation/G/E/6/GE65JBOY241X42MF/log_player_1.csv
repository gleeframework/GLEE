Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely to be rejected. This sets the stage for a negotiation and gives me room to bargain. I want to see if Bob is truly interested and gauge his potential value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price but still leaving some room for negotiation. I believe $900,000 is a fair compromise, and I hope Bob will see it as a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Although Bob is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. John offers a secure deal that meets my minimum value. It's time to accept John's offer and avoid any further risk or uncertainty."
