You have three options:

I'm starting with a low offer to see how much wiggle room there is. I'm hoping Alice is willing to negotiate significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I can do $130, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. It's a great product, and I think you'll really get your money's worth! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $130 is better, I think there's still room for negotiation before I have to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $115? That's a fair deal for both of us."",

I'm aiming for the middle ground between her last offer and mine. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also want a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like that you're willing to meet in the middle, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $125. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to make a sale 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to meet me somewhere in the middle.  $125 is a reasonable price and a good compromise, well below my maximum budget. It's time to accept the deal."
