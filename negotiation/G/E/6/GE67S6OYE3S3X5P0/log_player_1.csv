{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my potential profit.  While $1,000,000 is my absolute minimum, I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I'm not yet ready to accept it. I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than his offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a good price.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to what I'm hoping for, and it's more than the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. It's time to take the deal and secure the sale."
