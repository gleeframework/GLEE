Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I've analyzed its market value thoroughly, and I'm confident it's worth much more.  How about we meet halfway at $1,400,000? This reflects its value while still offering you a substantial return on investment.

Alice's offer is still higher than my budget.  I'm going to continue to negotiate with her, but I'll also keep the option of buying from John in mind."

Alice's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm going to try to negotiate one last time before potentially going with John."
