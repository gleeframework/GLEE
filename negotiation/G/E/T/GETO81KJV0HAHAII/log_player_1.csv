{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:** This shows you are serious about selling to Bob and not just looking to get the minimum. 
* **It's lower than the product's worth to Bob:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.

I'll be ready to respond to Bob's counteroffer or make a new one if needed, while also keeping John's $800,000 offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am not comfortable with the price of $1,200,000. Considering the product's value to me, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below the value I want to get for the product. I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Maintain my position:** This shows Bob that I'm not desperate for a sale at any price.
* **Explore better options:** I can counteroffer with a price closer to my target.
* **See how committed Bob is:** If he walks away, I still have John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still significantly lower than the value of the product to me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This represents a compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This offer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product.
* **Maintaining leverage:** $1,100,000 is still above Bob's initial offer and closer to my desired price. This gives me some leverage in the negotiation.
* **Keeping John in mind:** I'm still aware of John's offer, so I'm not being overly aggressive with my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counter-counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects a reasonable compromise between the value of the product to me and the cost to you. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price. While I would love to push for more, considering the following:

* **Value to Bob:** Bob clearly sees value in the product, as evidenced by his multiple counteroffers.  
* **Potential for stalemate:**  Further negotiation might risk losing the deal completely. 
* **John's offer:** I have a solid fallback option with John's $800,000 offer.

Accepting Bob's offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of a protracted negotiation."
