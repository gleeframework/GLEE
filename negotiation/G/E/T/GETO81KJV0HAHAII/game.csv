"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am not comfortable with the price of $1,200,000. Considering the product's value to me, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still significantly lower than the value of the product to me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This represents a compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counter-counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects a reasonable compromise between the value of the product to me and the cost to you. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both parties.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
