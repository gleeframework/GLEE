"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $8000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $9000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10500. It's a compromise that still allows me to make a profit, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",10500.0,Alice,5,
