"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product that I think you'll love. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $200.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100.  Would you be willing to consider that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $175. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $125?  Let's try to bridge the gap.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $155. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",155.0,Alice,5,
