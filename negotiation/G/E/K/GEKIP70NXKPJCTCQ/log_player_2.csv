"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is a better deal than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This would be a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so it makes sense to continue negotiating. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and hopefully get closer to his desired price point."
