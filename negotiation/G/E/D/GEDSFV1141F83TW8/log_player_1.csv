Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
This is a starting point in the negotiation. Here's why I chose this approach:

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good tactic to start a negotiation slightly above your desired outcome. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Since you know the product is worth $120 to Bob, starting at $115 leaves some room for negotiation while still aiming for a price close to his perceived value.
* **Above Your Minimum:** This offer ensures that even if Bob negotiates down a bit, you'll still make more than selling to John.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit high for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer is quite low and significantly below both your valuation and his own. It seems like he's trying to anchor the negotiation in his favor. 

Here's my recommendation:

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Your Minimum:** Accepting $90 would mean selling significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Exploiting Information:** Bob is trying to take advantage of the fact that he knows the product's value to him is higher. 

You have a good alternative in John, so you have leverage. By rejecting this low offer, you signal that you're serious about getting a fair price. Let's see if Bob is willing to negotiate more reasonably in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer, but $90 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. This product offers you a lot of value, and I'm confident it's worth more to you. Would you consider $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer firmly rejects Bob's lowball offer while still demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. 
* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):**  You've moved down from $115 to $105, a significant concession. However, you haven't met Bob in the middle ($105 is still closer to your initial offer). This keeps the negotiation moving but shows you're not desperate.
* **Above Your Minimum:** You're still aiming for a price above your minimum acceptable value.

This offer puts the ball back in Bob's court. Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate that, Alice. While I agree there's value, I have a budget in mind. Could we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","This is a tempting offer from Bob. Let's analyze your options:

* **Accepting:**  This meets your absolute minimum price and gets you a sale. 
* **Rejecting and Countering:** There's a chance Bob might go slightly higher, but there's also the risk he walks away.
* **Selling to John:** This guarantees you the same amount ($100) with no further negotiation.

Given these factors, here's my recommendation:

```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Your Goal:** Remember, your goal is to earn as much as you can *above* your minimum. While there's a slim chance of getting more from Bob, it's not worth the risk of losing the sale entirely.
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time and effort. Accepting now guarantees your $100 without further hassle.
* **Minimal Gains:** The potential upside of further negotiation is small, especially when weighed against the certainty of accepting Bob's current offer. 

Sometimes, a sure thing in hand is better than the possibility of slightly more in the bush."
