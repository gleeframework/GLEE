"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000 is still quite high.  Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for now.  There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price.  It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for potential compromise. The offer is also below your maximum budget, giving you some wiggle room."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is my best price for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you're comfortable with at this point.  You can still attempt to negotiate a lower price, and there's no guarantee that Alice won't accept a lower counteroffer in the next round. Buying from John at $1,200,000 is still out of the question as you can potentially get the product for a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still not quite there yet. How about $825,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. "", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a further reduction from Alice's last offer, demonstrating your commitment to negotiating a lower price. It is also still significantly below Alice's desired price, leaving some room for further negotiation if needed.  The offer is close to Alice's minimum price, which could make it more appealing for her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $825,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is my final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still higher than your ideal price. It is also close to your maximum budget, and if you accept, you won't have much room for negotiation with other sellers in the future.  You have a few rounds left, so continuing to negotiate with Alice is still a better option than accepting her current offer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $950,000, but I'm still hoping we can get closer to a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $875,000. This is a good price for both of us and  keeps us both within our budgets. I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Reduction:** This counteroffer further reduces the price, showing Alice you're serious about finding a lower price.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

* **Fair Compromise:** $900,000 is a reasonable compromise.  It's significantly lower than Alice's last offer but higher than your previous offer. 
* **Urgency:** The message suggests that you're getting close to a deal and encourages Alice to accept. This can help create a sense of urgency.

**Important Note:**  At this point, you're running out of rounds.  It's crucial to find a price that Alice is willing to accept, as you only have two rounds left before having to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last push to try to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $990,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **One Round Left:** This is the final round of negotiation with Alice before you have to buy from John. 
* **Still Too High:** While Alice's offer of $990,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you're comfortable with. You still have a chance to negotiate a lower price.
* **Final Counteroffer:** It's now or never! You need to make a final counteroffer and hope Alice will accept it.

You should send a counteroffer that's close to Alice's minimum, hoping she will accept.  The goal is to get the lowest price possible while still securing the product."

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.

This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is your final chance to secure a deal with Alice, so it's crucial to make a reasonable offer.
