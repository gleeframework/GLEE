"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. I believe it's a great value for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $13000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only do $11500 right now.  What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $11500 is a good offer, I'm still looking to get closer to $12000. Would you consider $11800? This would allow me to make this deal work and still get a fair price for my product.",11800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11800 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  How about $11600?  This is a fair compromise for both of us, and lets me get the product within my budget.",11600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and meet at $11700? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let me know what you think.",11700.0,Alice,5,
