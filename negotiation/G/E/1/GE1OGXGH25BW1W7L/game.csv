"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but  $925,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $890,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",890000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $890,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $915,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for you.",915000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I understand you need a fair price, and I'm trying to make this work. How about $900,000? That's a firm offer from me.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $915,000 and $900,000, which is $907,500. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to accept it.",907500.0,Alice,7,
