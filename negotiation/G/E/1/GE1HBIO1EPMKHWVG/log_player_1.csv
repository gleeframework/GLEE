Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $80 to me, I'll start with a price that's slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": $90}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price, so I'll reject it and try to get a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than $75 but lower than $90.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
{""counteroffer"": $85}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here's the counteroffer:

{""product_price"": $85}

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway between his offer of $75 and my original offer of $90."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob is sticking to his guns! Since his offer of $80 is equal to my minimum price, I'll accept it. It's a fair deal, and I'll get the minimum amount I'm willing to sell the product for.
