"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $11000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",11000.0,Alice,3,
