"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $600000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $450000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",450000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $450000. Considering the product's unique features and potential benefits, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $550000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good compromise.",550000.0,Alice,3,
