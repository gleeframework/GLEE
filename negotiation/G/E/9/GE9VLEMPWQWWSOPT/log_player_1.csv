Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you and a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $10,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:**  There's still $2,000 of potential profit above my minimum of $12,000.
* **Negotiation Friendly:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in negotiation. 

This approach balances maximizing profit with keeping the negotiation open and potentially achieving a higher price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While $9,000 is a good offer, I still believe there's potential to get closer to my desired price range.
* **Maintaining Control:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and potentially drive up the price further. 
* **No Immediate Need:**  I'm not in a desperate position, as I have the guaranteed $12,000 option with John. This gives me leverage to push for a better deal with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can propose a counteroffer that is more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $9,500? It's a good deal for both of us, and we can finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  This offer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still holding out for a higher price, but offering a slight concession shows that I'm open to a deal. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes mutual benefit, encouraging Bob to see the value in closing the deal at this price. 

This counteroffer increases the chances of a successful deal while still aiming for a price that is closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $9,250 is very close to my minimum desired price of $12,000, making it a good deal for me.
* **Risk of Further Negotiations:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will budge further, and continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price or a stalemate.
* **Time Factor:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of delaying the sale. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  $9,250 still gives me a significant profit, and I'm comfortable with that outcome.

Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale with a good profit margin, mitigating potential risks and delays associated with further negotiation."
