"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $1,000,000. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can work together to make this happen. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  The product offers unique advantages, and I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's worth.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,800,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which reflects a fair compromise.  This is my final offer. ",1200000.0,Bob,4,
