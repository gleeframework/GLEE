Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum price of $100 but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers.  Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, I believe this is a fair price that will incentivize him to buy without immediately rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I would ideally like to get closer to my desired price of $115,  Bob's counteroffer of $110 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum price of $100 and  is likely the best I can get from Bob. Selling to John for $100 would be less profitable."
