# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

* **Your value:** The product is worth $120 to you.
* **Alice's value:** The product is worth $80 to Alice.
* **Alice's offer:** $100
