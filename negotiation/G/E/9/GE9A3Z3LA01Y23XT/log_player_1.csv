Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $120, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to get at least $80 to match what John will pay.
* **Splitting the Difference:** Offering the product at $100 splits the difference between Bob's valuation ($120) and your minimum acceptable price ($80). This strategy often leads to a successful negotiation as it offers a fair deal for both parties."
