{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** You're aiming to save as much as possible, and $1,250,000 is a significant amount above your desired price range. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a lower price, potentially securing a better deal.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** You can always go to John if the negotiation with Alice fails. This gives you leverage during the counteroffer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing you are serious about getting a better deal.
* **Within your budget:**  $1,050,000 is still within your maximum price range.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** It gives Alice room to come down slightly without feeling like she's giving away too much."

* **Minimizing risk:**  While you could potentially push for a lower price, there's a risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and the negotiation dragging on.  
* **Value proposition:** $1,150,000 is a good compromise, saving you $350,000 compared to buying from John."
