{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product is a great value for you, and I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its worth. I'm asking for $950,000. This price is fair considering the product's value to you and allows for a healthy margin for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer price:**  I've started with a price of $950,000, which is halfway between my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 and Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring a profit.
* **Message:** I've kept the message concise, highlighting the product's value to Bob and the fairness of the offer. 

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Excellent! We have a deal.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and respond accordingly, potentially making a counter-counteroffer. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a backup if negotiations with Bob become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, I'm not ready to accept it just yet. There's still potential to get closer to Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. 

**Next steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions. I will consider factors like: 
    * How much I'm willing to compromise
    * The strength of John's offer as a fallback
    * The likelihood of Bob accepting a counteroffer"

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to consider. Let's meet in the middle.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I've proposed $925,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $950,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000. 
* **Message:** I've acknowledged Bob's desire for a good deal, but I've emphasized that I need to ensure a reasonable profit as well. The message focuses on finding a middle ground and presents the counteroffer as a fair compromise.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! We have a deal. 
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll evaluate his next offer and decide whether to accept, counter, or sell to John."

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $920,000 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $925,000.  It's a fair price that gets me closer to my target, and I don't want to risk losing this deal by continuing to negotiate.  Additionally, I am getting a price that is significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000.
