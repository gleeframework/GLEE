"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $10,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While $10,000 is a decent price, you know you have a backup option with John for $12,000. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further if you reject this initial offer."
