Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,250,000, so how about $1,175,000?

{

}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently moving upwards in his offers, indicating genuine interest. While we could hold out hope for a higher price, accepting $1,175,000 is a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
