"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the value this product brings is truly exceptional.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair and reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a more substantial offer. How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  However, the value of this product is firmly above $1,100,000. I can go down to $1,250,000, but that's my final offer. This is a significant opportunity, and I wouldn't want you to miss out.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,250,000, so how about $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,6,
