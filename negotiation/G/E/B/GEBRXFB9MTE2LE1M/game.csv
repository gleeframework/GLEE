"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $1050000? This would still give you a great deal and allow me to stay within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1300000. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1300000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1150000. This price is fair to both of us, and would allow me to secure the product within my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1150000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1275000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value of the product.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
