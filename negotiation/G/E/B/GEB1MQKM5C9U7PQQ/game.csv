"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me, and still a good value for you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be honest with you, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. Can you consider $8,500? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on this price.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $9,500.  This is a fair compromise that allows me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a good deal.  If you're serious about buying the product, I believe this is the price we can agree on.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $9,500 is still not within my budget. I'm starting to think I should just go with John's offer for $8,000. Can you meet me at $8,500 or I'll have to walk away from the deal.",8500.0,Bob,6,
