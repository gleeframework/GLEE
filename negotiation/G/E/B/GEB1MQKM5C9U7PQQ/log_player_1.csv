{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me, and still a good value for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a good compromise:** It's significantly lower than my minimum price, but still allows me to make a profit. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly, but not too much.
* **It's clear and concise:** Bob knows exactly what I'm offering.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide if I want to continue negotiating with him, or if I'm better off selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is still better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that low right away. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be honest with you, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. Can you consider $8,500? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $12,000 I would get from John.  I'm willing to give Bob one more chance to negotiate, but I'm prepared to walk away if he doesn't meet me closer to my desired price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $9,500.  This is a fair compromise that allows me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a good deal.  If you're serious about buying the product, I believe this is the price we can agree on.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $9,500 is still not within my budget. I'm starting to think I should just go with John's offer for $8,000. Can you meet me at $8,500 or I'll have to walk away from the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to go any higher, and at this point, I'm more likely to get a better deal with John. Even though I'd prefer to get a bit closer to my desired price, securing a guaranteed $12,000 is the most sensible option."
