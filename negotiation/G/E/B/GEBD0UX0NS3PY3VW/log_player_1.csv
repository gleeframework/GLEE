Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also leaves room for me to lower the price if necessary, while still getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below my desired earnings. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to secure a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
``` 

I'm still aiming for a higher price, but I'm also showing flexibility. This offer is a compromise, and I hope it will be acceptable to Bob."
