{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for my budget. Let's try $105, and we can close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more, Bob. How about we try 108? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $108, which is within your $150 limit. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she might not budge or even increase the price again. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of losing the deal."
