"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high initial price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting high, I aim to anchor the negotiation in my favor. Even if Bob counters much lower, the final price is more likely to be closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate your initial offer, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. My counteroffer is $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price and my initial offer. While I want to find a deal, accepting this would be a substantial loss. I believe there's room for negotiation, so I will counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but that price point doesn't reflect the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that's more in line with what we're both looking to achieve. How about we meet halfway at $1,750,000?"",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a price exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This signals a willingness to negotiate while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message reiterates the product's value, subtly pushing back against Bob's attempt to anchor the price lower.
* **Seeking Agreement:**  The phrasing ""meet halfway"" and ""what we're both looking to achieve"" emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches John's standing offer. While I could try to push for a slightly higher price in further rounds, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher. Accepting this offer secures the best possible outcome at this point."
