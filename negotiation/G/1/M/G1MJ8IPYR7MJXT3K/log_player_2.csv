"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $8,500.  I know it's worth that much to you, and it's a fair price considering its value.  If you're interested, let me know.  If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum price of $8,000.  While rejecting Alice's offer means Bob might not get the product, it's better than paying more than he's willing to spend. Bob can still buy the product from John for his maximum price."
