"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's worth a lot to me, but I know you'll find it very valuable as well. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction.  Let me know if you're interested! If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Here's how to reason through this:

* **Your maximum:** You're willing to pay $15,000.
* **Alice's offer:** $14,000
* **John's offer:** $15,000

Alice's offer is less than both your maximum and John's offer.  This saves you money.

**Answer:** {""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
