Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer the product at $150 (its value to you), there's a chance Bob might accept a slightly lower price. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $145 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($120). However, the phrase ""a steal"" and highlighting the value proposition might sway him.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, so there's limited risk in aiming slightly higher with Bob."
