Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $9,500.  I know it's valuable to you and I'm offering you the chance to own it before I list it publicly."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $10,000, maximizing profit means getting the highest price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $9,500 is a strong starting point. It's significantly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The message subtly creates urgency (""before I list it publicly"") and implies exclusivity, which can nudge Bob towards accepting. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, further negotiation might be necessary."
