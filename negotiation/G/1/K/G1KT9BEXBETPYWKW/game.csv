"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500. It's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's close this deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $12,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $13,500 is the lowest I can go. I'm not getting any younger, and I'd like to close this deal today. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
