Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think you'll find great value in it. I'm willing to part with it for $9,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could lead to a quicker sale and still net a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $9,500 is a strong offer that leaves me with a $1,500 buffer over Bob's perceived value. It incentivizes him to act without completely devaluing the product.
* **Relationship Building:**  The message implies a degree of exclusivity and potential for a good deal, encouraging a positive response from Bob."
