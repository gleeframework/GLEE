"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum of $12,000 as possible, but I also don't want to scare him off immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,000.  It's still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully will get us closer to a deal."
