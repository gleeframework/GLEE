"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for bargaining. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to lower the price in subsequent rounds, but I'm aiming to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $65. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum price of $100, and I'm not willing to sell it at a loss. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $65 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $75 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $85.  This is a very fair price considering the product's value. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $80? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I've tried to negotiate with him,  it seems like we are far apart in our valuations. I've only got 4 rounds left and I don't want to risk losing out on the guaranteed $100 from John. It's better to sell to John and ensure I get my desired profit."
