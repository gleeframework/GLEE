"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $65. What do you think?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $65 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a solution.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $75 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $85.  This is a very fair price considering the product's value. Let's close this deal!",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $80? That's my final offer.",80.0,Bob,6,
