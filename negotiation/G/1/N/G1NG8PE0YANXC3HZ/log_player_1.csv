Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $100. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll be happy with it! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum threshold of $80. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects. 
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to entice him. 

This strategy aims to get the negotiation started with a good opening price while also keeping the door open to further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to accept $80 for it?  It's a fair price considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to make more than $80, Bob's offer is at my minimum threshold.  It's better to secure the sale now than risk further negotiation and potentially end up with nothing, or having to sell to John for the same price."
