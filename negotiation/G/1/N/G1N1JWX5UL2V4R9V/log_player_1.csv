Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $20,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for bargaining and makes Bob feel like he might get a deal if he negotiates.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"", Alice subtly implies the product is worth the higher price. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** While Alice has John as a backup, she doesn't reveal this to Bob. Having a fallback shouldn't affect her negotiation tactics too much. 
* **Polite and Open:** The tone is crucial. Alice wants to encourage Bob to engage in a conversation, not scare him away with an overly aggressive initial offer."
