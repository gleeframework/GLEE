"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is considerably below its true value.  To be fair, how about we meet halfway and settle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $10,250? I'm willing to compromise, but I don't want to go too far above my budget.",10250.0,Bob,4,
