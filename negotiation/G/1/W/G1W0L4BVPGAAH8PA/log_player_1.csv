Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 950000} 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's a fair price:**  It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and a good profit margin for Bob.
* **It's aggressive:**  By starting high, you establish your desired value for the product and set the tone for the negotiation. 
* **It leaves room for compromise:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you can come down slightly, but still be within your desired range.

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still far below the value I know the product holds for him.  I want to see if I can push him closer to my desired price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing that I am willing to negotiate. It's still higher than Bob's offer, but it demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to reach an agreement. I'm hoping Bob recognizes the value of the product and will meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  Bob's offer of $875,000 is a good compromise.  It's significantly higher than selling to John, and with each round the gap between our offers is shrinking.  It's time to secure the deal and maximize my earnings."
