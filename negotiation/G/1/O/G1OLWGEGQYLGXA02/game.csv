"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 might be a bit out of your budget, but I'm not willing to go down to $80. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we do $85? It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $85 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $82?",82.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $85 was still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $82. However, I'm willing to make another concession. How about we do $84? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm getting close to my minimum price.",84.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but $84 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $82. How about we do $83?",83.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go all the way down to $83. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we do $84.50? It's my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",84.5,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm disappointed that we couldn't come to an agreement at $84.50, but I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go any higher than that. I'm going to have to pass on this deal and sell the product to someone else. I'm willing to sell it to John for $80. It was nice negotiating with you, Bob.",80.0,Alice,9,
