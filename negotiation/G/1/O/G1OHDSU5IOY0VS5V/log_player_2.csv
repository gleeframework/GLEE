"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $10,500? That would give you a great price, and I'd still be able to make a good profit. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,750 is still too low for me. Let's try $10,250. It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very slowly lowering her price.  At this rate, it's unlikely you'll get a deal significantly better than John's offer of $10,000. It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed good deal from John."
