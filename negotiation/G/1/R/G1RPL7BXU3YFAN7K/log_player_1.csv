""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. This product is highly valuable and sought after, and I believe it would be a great asset to you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob could yield greater profit.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $800,000.  Offering it significantly above this might make him immediately disengage.
* **Negotiation Room:** The initial offer leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping us well above our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Justification:** The message highlights the product's value and positions the price as fair, increasing the chance of Bob accepting the offer."
