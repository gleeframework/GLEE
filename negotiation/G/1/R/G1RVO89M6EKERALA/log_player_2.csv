``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  You can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer to Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to spend $10500, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11250. It's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still some wiggle room.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer could lead to a more favorable price for you."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're really close to making a decision, but I'm still not willing to go all the way to $11000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10900. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is a good deal for you. It's below your maximum price of $12,000 and is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice will not budge much more, and you risk losing the product altogether.  It's best to accept her offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
