Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price (your ""reservation value"").
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, giving him a potential profit of $200,000 if he buys at your minimum.
* **The Zone of Agreement:**  There's a range between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000 where a deal benefits both of you.

**Offer Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Here's a balanced approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,150,000, reflecting its significant worth."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,150,000 captures a significant portion of the potential profit for you.
* **Leaves Value for Bob:**  Bob still gets a $50,000 gain, incentivizing him to accept.
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant worth"" emphasize the product's value.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $1,150,000. You could start higher and negotiate down, but going too high initially might make him walk away."
