Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to let it go for $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is valuable.
* **Not Too High:**  While we want to maximize profit, setting the price too high (like $250) might make Bob immediately lose interest without even trying to negotiate. 
* **Justification:** By saying ""I think it's worth a lot,"" Alice provides a subtle justification for the higher price without revealing her minimum.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
