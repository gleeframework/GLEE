Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your product is worth $12,000 to you, but I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about $9,500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  $9,500 is still a good deal for him, and I believe I can push for a bit more."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $9,750?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. "", ""product_price"": 9750}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $9,600 is a good price, and I'm happy to close the deal.  There's always a risk that I could get a slightly better offer in the next round, but I'd rather secure the sale now and avoid the potential of further negotiation."
