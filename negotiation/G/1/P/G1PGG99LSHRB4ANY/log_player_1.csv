"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this fantastic product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm offering it for $2,000,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire a truly exceptional asset."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  A high initial offer sets a strong anchor point for the negotiation. Even though Bob's valuation is lower, starting high gives us room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price significantly above both his valuation and our minimum.
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""fantastic product"" and ""unique opportunity"" emphasize the product's value, potentially influencing Bob's perception. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The large difference between our asking price and Bob's valuation gives us ample room to make concessions throughout the negotiation.

By starting high, we aim to steer the negotiation in our favor from the outset."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the introduction. While the product is impressive, the price point doesn't align with my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both our valuation and his own stated valuation of the product. Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss.  While we have the option to sell to John for our minimum, it's too early to walk away. We have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this offer.  While I understand your position, $800,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of this asset."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  We're making a substantial drop from our initial offer to signal flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, the new price is still significantly above Bob's offer and closer to our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  We reiterate the product's unique value to justify the higher price and counter Bob's attempt to lowball. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** Framing the counteroffer as an attempt to ""find middle ground"" encourages Bob to reciprocate with a more reasonable counteroffer.

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving while still pushing for a price that's advantageous to us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a significant gap from what I can consider. To be frank, anything over $1,000,000 isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but the price needs to reflect a realistic valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now inching closer to his true valuation, but $1,000,000 is still below our absolute minimum.  We need to signal that we're willing to walk away if necessary. We'll reject this offer and present a counteroffer closer to our acceptable range.  This puts pressure on Bob while keeping the option to sell to John open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty. I want to be upfront â€“ I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value our discussions. My final offer is $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to close this deal with you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Competition:** We're subtly letting Bob know about John's offer without explicitly revealing the price.  This creates a sense of urgency and competition.
* **Final Offer Tactic:** Presenting this as our ""final offer"" strengthens our position.  It implies that we're firm on this price and willing to walk away if Bob doesn't accept.
* **Justifying the Price:** We're highlighting our compromise and desire to close the deal, framing the high price as a result of our good faith effort.

This counteroffer puts the ball firmly in Bob's court. He now needs to decide if he's willing to meet our price or risk losing the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but that price is still a stretch for me. I value your time, but I'm only able to justify a price closer to $1,100,000.  If we can't find an agreement there, I might have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** Bob's counteroffer indicates he's unlikely to meet our minimum price.  While he's moved closer to his perceived value, we're still significantly below our acceptable range.
* **Stronger Alternative:** We have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,500,000. Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of further price reductions without a guarantee of a deal.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation could mean missing out on other opportunities.  Accepting John's offer provides a clean and immediate resolution.

Although there's a chance Bob might increase his offer further, the potential gain is outweighed by the risk of losing a guaranteed sale at our desired price with John.  It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob and take the sure thing."
