"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this fantastic product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm offering it for $2,000,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire a truly exceptional asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's beneficial to engage in negotiation to try and lower the price significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the introduction. While the product is impressive, the price point doesn't align with my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this offer.  While I understand your position, $800,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of this asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's price reduction is minimal. We're still very far from a reasonable price point, so continued negotiation is necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a significant gap from what I can consider. To be frank, anything over $1,000,000 isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but the price needs to reflect a realistic valuation."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty. I want to be upfront â€“ I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value our discussions. My final offer is $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to close this deal with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

This is a critical point in the negotiation. While Alice is coming down, and mentioning another buyer is a common negotiation tactic, we're still a good amount above our ideal price. We need to show we're willing to walk away to see if she'll go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but that price is still a stretch for me. I value your time, but I'm only able to justify a price closer to $1,100,000.  If we can't find an agreement there, I might have to explore other options."",
