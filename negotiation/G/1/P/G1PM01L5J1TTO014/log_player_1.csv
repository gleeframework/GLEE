I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary, while still ensuring I get a good profit.  I'm hoping Bob values the product highly enough to be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a lower offer, but still above John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm countering with $1,600,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I'm hoping it's a sweet spot that Bob will find appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a little more, $1,300,000 is still a good profit and is significantly better than selling to John.  I'm ready to close the deal."
