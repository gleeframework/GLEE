"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9,500.  I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further. You can likely get a better price than $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

$9,000 is a good price, especially since it's a compromise.  It's still under your budget and you're closer to Alice's desired price."
