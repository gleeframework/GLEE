**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product at $13,000. This is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($12,000). 
* **Message:** The message highlights the product's value to me and emphasizes the potential savings for Bob.  This is intended to increase the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer.
* **Backup Plan:**  I have a backup plan with John to sell the product for $15,000, ensuring I won't lose money even if Bob declines."
