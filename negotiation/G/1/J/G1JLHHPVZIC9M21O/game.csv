"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you starting the conversation. I'm very interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to consider $11,000? I think that's fair given its value to me.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,000. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price point.  Would you consider $11,500? I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another move to find a compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,800. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. What do you think?",12800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, but $12,800 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to settle at $12,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects both the product's value and our negotiation.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I'm willing to make another move to find a compromise. However, I'm not willing to go down to $12,000. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,500. It's still a great deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,250?  That seems like a fair compromise to me.",12250.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,375. It's still a great deal, and I'm willing to make one more move to find a compromise. What do you think?",12375.0,Alice,9,
