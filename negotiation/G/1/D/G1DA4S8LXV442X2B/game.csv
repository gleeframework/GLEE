"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell the product to you for $9,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle.  How about $7,500? That's a fair offer.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to compromise again and sell the product to you for $8,500. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",8500.0,Alice,5,
