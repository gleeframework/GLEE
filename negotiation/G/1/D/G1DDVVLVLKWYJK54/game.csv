"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is likely much higher. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the enthusiasm for the product.  However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Would you be willing to come down to $850000?  That would be a good starting point for us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects its true value. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
