"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay $120 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not able to pay more than $120 for the product. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120

While it's not ideal to go below $135, getting $120 from Bob is still a better outcome than accepting John's standing offer of $100."
