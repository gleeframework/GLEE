"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is considerably below its true value. I could consider $1,120,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1120000.0,Alice,3,
