Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your value. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum and closer to John's offer. I'll try to negotiate a bit more.
