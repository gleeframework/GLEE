I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, leaving room for negotiation. It's a strong opening offer that shows I value the product highly, but also leaves space to come down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my ideal price. I believe I can push for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering Bob's offer with $13,500. This is a compromise, showing flexibility but still above Bob's offer.  This might be a good middle ground for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

While I'd like to get more than $10,000, Bob's counter-offers are getting too close to my minimum. It seems we are at an impasse, so it's best to secure the sale with John at this point."
