"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal for you, as you've indicated you value it at $10,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is less than her stated value, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Rejecting her offer opens the door for you to buy it from John at your desired price."
