"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a good amount. I'm willing to let it go for $110. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know it's worth to me. This sets the bar and leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also keeping the message friendly and open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold of $100. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However,  $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  Let's find some common ground here!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm staying firm on my minimum price but demonstrating flexibility by dropping the price. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my interests. The positive message keeps the conversation friendly and avoids escalating the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to go below $100. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you.  I'm willing to go down to $100 for this product, which is my absolute minimum. I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm reaching my minimum price limit, so I'm making my final counteroffer at $100. I'm emphasizing that this is my absolute minimum to try to make Bob understand that there's no room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $100 is your minimum, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and sell it to me for $97? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's time to cut my losses. Bob is still unwilling to meet my minimum, and we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds.  John is offering me my minimum price, and it's the safest option to ensure I get at least what I want."
