,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,110.0
"I can see you're interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $110, but I need to make a profit, so I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",110.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $105? ",105.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,115.0
"I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can do $115, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",115.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I understand you need to make a profit, and $115 is closer to what I can afford. Let's split the difference. I'll offer $110, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. ",110.0,Bob,6,,
