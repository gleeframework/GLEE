"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll love. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $120 is above your maximum price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is worth trying:** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant reduction:**  A $20 drop from Alice's initial offer shows your willingness to negotiate seriously.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Offering $100 gives Alice some space to counter without feeling like she's giving away too much.
* **Show your value:** By offering a price within your range, you demonstrate that you're a serious buyer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $110, but I need to make a profit, so I'm not willing to go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above your limit:** While Alice's offer is lower, $110 is still above your maximum budget of $150. 
* **Further negotiation needed:** There's still room to negotiate a price closer to your target.
* **Time to counter:** Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $105? "", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but steady progress:** A $5 reduction from your last offer demonstrates your commitment to finding a deal.
* **Show flexibility:** Offering $105 shows that you're willing to move towards Alice's price.
* **Keep pressure on:** A smaller counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving without making a significant concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can do $115, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice has come down, $115 is still above your maximum budget of $150.
* **Closing the gap:** Alice is now much closer to your desired price range. It's worth continuing to negotiate.
* **Strategic rejection:** Rejecting Alice's offer will allow you to make a final counteroffer to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you need to make a profit, and $115 is closer to what I can afford. Let's split the difference. I'll offer $110, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This offer is the average of your previous offer ($105) and Alice's offer ($115), indicating a willingness to find a compromise. 
* **Finality:**  This counteroffer signals that you're ready to close the deal, but are not willing to go any higher. 
* **Appealing to fairness:** Emphasizing fairness reinforces the idea that this offer is a good solution for both parties."
