"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,050,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget while still giving you a good profit margin.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not quite there yet. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'd like to try to get closer to the value you place on it. I'm willing to go up to $1,020,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $1,020,000 is closer to my target, but I'm still not quite there.  I'd like to offer $1,010,000. This is a reasonable compromise and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",1010000.0,Bob,6,
