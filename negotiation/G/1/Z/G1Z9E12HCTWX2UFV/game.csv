"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,250,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $1,175,000? I think that's a fair offer.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $1,175,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price considering the product's value. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
