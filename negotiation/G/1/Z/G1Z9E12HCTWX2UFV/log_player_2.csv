Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,250,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $1,175,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price considering the product's value. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options.

Alice is signaling this is her final offer and she's unlikely to go much lower. While negotiating further might yield a slightly better price, it's not worth the risk of losing out on John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer."
