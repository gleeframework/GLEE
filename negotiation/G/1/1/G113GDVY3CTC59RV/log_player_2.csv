**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, and we are getting close to her likely bottom line.  While we might be able to squeeze out a few hundred dollars more by continuing to negotiate, there's also the risk that Alice won't budge further. Accepting at $11,000 guarantees a good deal without the risk of having to pay John's $12,000 price."
