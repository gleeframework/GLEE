"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first.  $1,100,000 is too high, and you have 10 rounds to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering I'm willing to buy it from you directly, rather than going through John. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  It's still a fair price for both of us, considering you're getting a good deal and I'm not settling for a big loss. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. You're closer to a deal, but still have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $975,000. This is a fair price that respects both of our needs, and allows us to close this deal quickly.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $975,000 is closer, I'm still holding out for $1,025,000. This price is fair considering the value of the product for both of us. It's a good deal for you and it allows me to meet my needs. Let's close this deal now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're getting closer to the price you're willing to pay, but it's still not there.  Rejecting Alice's offer gives you more room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, let's make this final offer.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, but I won't go any higher.  If you accept, we can close the deal right now.  If not, I'll have to consider buying from John at that price.  It's your call."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
