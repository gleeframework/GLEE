"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering I'm willing to buy it from you directly, rather than going through John. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy he's interested in buying directly, $900,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get closer to my desired price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $975,000. This is a fair price that respects both of our needs, and allows us to close this deal quickly.  What do you say?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my target, I'm still not happy with $975,000. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with some further negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and see if he's willing to go higher."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's make this final offer.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, but I won't go any higher.  If you accept, we can close the deal right now.  If not, I'll have to consider buying from John at that price.  It's your call.
