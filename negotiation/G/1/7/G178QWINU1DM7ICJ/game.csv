"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering I'm willing to buy it from you directly, rather than going through John. Let's see if we can work something out.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  It's still a fair price for both of us, considering you're getting a good deal and I'm not settling for a big loss. Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $975,000. This is a fair price that respects both of our needs, and allows us to close this deal quickly.  What do you say?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $975,000 is closer, I'm still holding out for $1,025,000. This price is fair considering the value of the product for both of us. It's a good deal for you and it allows me to meet my needs. Let's close this deal now.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, let's make this final offer.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, but I won't go any higher.  If you accept, we can close the deal right now.  If not, I'll have to consider buying from John at that price.  It's your call.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
