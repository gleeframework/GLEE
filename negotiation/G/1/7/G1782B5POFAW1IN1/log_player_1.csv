Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $18,000. I'm open to discussing the price, so feel free to share your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way beyond my budget. This product is valuable, but I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for being flexible.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000.  That's a significant jump from my previous offer and reflects my seriousness about buying this product.  What do you say?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my original ask.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This is a very fair offer."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $11,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch.  I could go up to $8,000, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a strong offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob has hit his maximum price of $8,000. It's unlikely he'll go higher. Accepting his offer would be a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed offer of $12,000.  It's time to cut bait with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale."
