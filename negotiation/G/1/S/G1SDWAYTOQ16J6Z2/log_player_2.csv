"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's above his budget, and he can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to do $8,500?  That's the absolute highest I'm willing to go."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750? That way we both get a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $8,750 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still higher than his ideal. He should keep negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a little too high for me.  I'm really looking to get this product for $8,250.  If you can come down to that, I'm ready to make a deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,250 just isn't feasible for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,500, but that's my final offer. If you're serious about getting this product, I think it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. Although it's still higher than his ideal price, it's a good compromise and a better deal than buying from John. He's saved $500 compared to John's price, and the negotiation is likely to continue for a few more rounds if he rejects. There's no guarantee that Alice will lower her price further."
