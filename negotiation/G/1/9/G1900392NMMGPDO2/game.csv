"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it, reflecting the value I see and leaving room for both of us to walk away satisfied.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value I believe the product holds.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference again. I'm prepared to offer $1,275,000.  I believe this is a fair price, and it gives us both room to close the deal.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,300,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to stay at least at $1,285,000. This is my final offer in this range. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1285000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. Let's get this done. I'm willing to go up to $1,270,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a good compromise. What do you say?",1270000.0,Bob,6,
