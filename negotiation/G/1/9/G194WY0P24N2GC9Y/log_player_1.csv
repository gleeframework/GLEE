"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000.  This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000, giving me room to negotiate.  It also demonstrates my confidence in the product's value. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value.  While I'd like to close the deal quickly, accepting his offer would be a huge loss for me. I'm going to counter with a higher price in the next round and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable value, but shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I hope this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come up with a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value, even though it's closer. I'm going to reject his offer again and continue negotiating. There's a chance we can reach a mutually agreeable price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,250,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still within my acceptable range. I'm trying to bridge the gap with Bob and make a deal before running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time, and Bob's offers are still not reaching my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to take the sure thing and sell the product to John for $1,200,000. While it's not ideal to get the full price I was hoping for, it's a good deal that ensures I don't lose money and avoids further risk of Bob rejecting another counteroffer."
