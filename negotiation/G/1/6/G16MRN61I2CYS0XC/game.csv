"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I'm looking to sell it to you for $900000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $750000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $850000. This is a compromise that should work for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $850000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $775000?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to make a fair deal, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $800000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,6,

"I've made some concessions, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $800000. However, I've already had another buyer interested in the product, and I'm starting to think it's worth considering selling to them. I'll make one final counteroffer to you: $820000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, I'm willing to discuss further.",820000.0,Alice,7,
