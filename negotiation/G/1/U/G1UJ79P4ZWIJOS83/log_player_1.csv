{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Not too high:** I'm not starting at my minimum price ($12,000) to allow for some flexibility. 
* **Positive tone:** A friendly approach encourages Bob to engage. 

**Next Steps:** 

I'll wait to see how Bob responds. Depending on his counteroffer, I might adjust my price or even choose to sell to John if Bob's offers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is below my minimum price of $12,000.
* **Potential for better deal:**  I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing negotiations with Bob.
* **Time is on my side:**  I can always sell to John if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving some room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest.  I can't go as low as $10,000, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($11,500) and Bob's offer ($10,000). This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain a reasonable price:** $11,000 is still above my minimum price ($12,000), but it shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive tone:** Using phrases like ""great deal"" and ""make this happen"" encourages Bob to see the value in reaching an agreement.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, we have a deal. If he rejects, I'll need to assess if I want to continue negotiating with him or simply sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I am still aiming to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to consider $10,500 as a compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While it's a slight improvement, $10,500 is still below my minimum price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is not getting closer:** We've been going back and forth, but the gap between our offers hasn't narrowed significantly. 
* **Time is running out:** I'm not sure if Bob will come up to my desired price, and I'm risking losing out on a sure $12,000 with John.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a final counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum, but leaving some room for compromise. However, if he rejects, I'll sell the product to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I truly appreciate your persistence, but I'm at my limit with the price.  I can go down to $11,250, but this is my final offer.  If you're interested, let's close this deal.  Otherwise, I'll need to move on."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  This is my last counteroffer, signifying the end of my negotiation window.
* **Slight compromise:**  I'm coming down slightly from my previous offer, but still above my minimum price, showing a willingness to make a deal.
* **Stronger stance:**  The message emphasizes my finality, giving Bob a sense of urgency.
* **Clear alternative:**  Mentioning John gives Bob a clear understanding of the potential consequences of rejecting the offer.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob accepts this final offer, I'll finalize the sale. If he rejects, I'll immediately sell the product to John for $12,000.  There's no further room for negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing out on a secure sale."
