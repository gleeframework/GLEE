"Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's something that's very valuable to me, and I believe it could be just as valuable to you.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its worth.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss it further.",10000.0,Alice,1,
