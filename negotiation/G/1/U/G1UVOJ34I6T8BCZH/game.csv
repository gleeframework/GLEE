"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Would you be willing to come down to $75?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $82.50. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",82.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $80? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to buy it right away.",80.0,Bob,4,
