"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $950000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $820000. This amount aligns more closely with what I am willing to invest in this purchase.",820000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $900000. I believe this is a reasonable price, and I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me at this price.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still feel that we are not reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. Given my current financial situation, I am unable to meet the price of $900000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850000. This amount is closer to what I am able to afford while still recognizing the value of the product.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, Bob. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Considering your previous offers, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $880000. This is as close as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",880000.0,Alice,5,
