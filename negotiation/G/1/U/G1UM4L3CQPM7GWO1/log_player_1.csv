{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount for Bob, but still leaves you with a profit margin of $2,000. This approach allows for potential negotiation and opens the door for a win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm trying to be a savvy buyer, and I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not in a rush to sell.  Bob's offer is too low, and there's a chance he might be willing to pay more. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price that gives you a good discount while ensuring I can still make a profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and $8,500 is a decent profit.  Accepting his offer is the best course of action to avoid further negotiations and secure the deal."
