"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it.  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $160. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $140? It's a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay and what the product is worth to you.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $140 is still a bit lower than I'd like, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I'm counteroffering at $155. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to accept.",155.0,Alice,5,
