"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $1,000,000.  It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $850000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $925000? This gives us both a good deal and allows us to close this transaction quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what you can get from John.  While it's a lower price than her initial offer, it's still not in your best interest to accept. You're better off trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
