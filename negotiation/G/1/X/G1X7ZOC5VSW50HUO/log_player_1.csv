Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect to make it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, signaling that I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. It also provides a starting point from which we can work towards a mutually beneficial price. If Bob rejects the offer, I can lower the price slightly in subsequent counteroffers.  However, I'll always have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if I feel the negotiations with Bob aren't going well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer but $1000000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** There's a good chance I can secure a higher price by counteroffering and continuing the negotiation.  
* **Selling to John is a Safety Net:**  I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 at any time, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's offer just because it's the only one on the table.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not willing to settle for his initial price.  My next counteroffer will aim to find a middle ground that is closer to my desired price.  I'll keep the possibility of selling to John in mind as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $850,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $925,000? This gives us both a good deal and allows us to close this transaction quickly."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm aiming for a compromise by proposing a price in the middle of our two previous offers. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the ""good deal"" aspect to entice Bob.
* **Time Sensitivity:** I'm suggesting a quick closure to put pressure on Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a calculated move. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate but also sets a firm lower bound that's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  If Bob accepts, I'll secure a better deal than his initial offer.  If he rejects, I can continue the negotiation or, as a last resort, sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $925000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. How about $900000? I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is only $200,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I could continue negotiating, the difference between our desired prices is narrowing.
* **Time and Risk:** Further negotiation might take time and increase the risk that Bob could walk away or find another seller.

**Strategy:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that's relatively close to my minimum target.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise considering the time and risk involved in continuing the negotiation.  I also have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if I change my mind later."
