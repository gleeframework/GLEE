Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts at a point that's fair to both of us. It's a bit below what the product is worth to Bob, but leaves some room for negotiation. It also gives Bob a good reason to accept my offer instead of risking going through several rounds of counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $12000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a bit below what I'm hoping for.  How about $12,500?  That way we both can walk away happy. "", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm glad we're still discussing this. I'm willing to pay $12200 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price,  $12,200 is a good deal considering my minimum is $10,000 and I'm avoiding further negotiation.  It's time to close the deal."
