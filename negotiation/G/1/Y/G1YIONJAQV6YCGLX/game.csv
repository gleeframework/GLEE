"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,200. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate you working with me.  While $8,200 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000.  Would you be willing to settle around there?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $7,800. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",7800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the effort to find a compromise.  How about we settle at $7,400? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",7400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you think we're getting closer! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $7,600. It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",7600.0,Alice,7,
