Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's something I've been developing for a long time and I'm confident it has the potential to [briefly describe the potential benefits to Bob].  I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000.  I know that's a significant investment, but I believe the potential return on investment is substantial. Let's discuss further if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** The message is crafted to pique Bob's interest by highlighting potential benefits without revealing too much information. 
* **Product Price:**  The price is set at $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from the minimum acceptable price, but allows room for negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

This approach attempts to balance maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. By starting high, there's potential for a higher sale price. However, the message attempts to make the offer appealing by emphasizing the product's value and potential benefits for Bob. 

It's important to remember that this is just one strategy.  The optimal approach will depend on factors like the nature of the product, your assessment of Bob's financial situation, and your negotiation skills."
