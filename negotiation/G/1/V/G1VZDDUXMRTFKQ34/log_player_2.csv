"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. It's worth $15,000 to you, so it's a great deal. If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $10,000, so this is your chance to get it at a lower price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.
