"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price, but I'm also willing to negotiate.  I've also included a friendly message to build rapport and emphasize the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is better than my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I want to see if I can push Bob a bit further before settling.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for you given the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}
