"Thanks Alice, I appreciate the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm  prepared to offer $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle.  While I'm willing to go a bit higher, $11,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you at $11,200, which is still a good discount from my original price. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
