# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Bob wants to save money and Alice's offer is too high.  He'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks Alice, I appreciate the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm  prepared to offer $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. He's willing to pay more than $9,000, but $11,000 is still a bit too high. He'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle.  While I'm willing to go a bit higher, $11,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you at $11,200, which is still a good discount from my original price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has been trying to negotiate a lower price, but Alice is unwilling to go below $11,200.  At this point, Bob is better off buying the product from John for $10,000. It's a guaranteed price, and he doesn't need to continue negotiating with Alice."
