"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm compensated fairly. How about $13,000?  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose $12,000 for the product. I hope this can be a mutually beneficial solution.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit below what I need. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $12,500. This gives us both a fair deal, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. While I see your point, I'm still unable to go above $12,000. I believe $11,500 could be a fair compromise. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,6,
