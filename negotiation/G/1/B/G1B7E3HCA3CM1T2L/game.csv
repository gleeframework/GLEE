,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $107.50? It's a fair price that I think we can both agree on.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $107.50 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  Would you consider $106?  I'm feeling really good about this product and want to make this deal work, but I need to stay within my budget.",106.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $106 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $108? It's the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",108.0,Alice,5,
