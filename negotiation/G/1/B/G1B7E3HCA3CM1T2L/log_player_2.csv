Alice's offer:

You have three options:

You should reject Alice's offer. While $107.50 is better than her previous offer, you can still get the product for less from John. You'll use the next round to try and negotiate a better price with Alice."

You have three options:

You should buy the product from John. Alice is clearly not going to budge much more, and $108 is still more than you're willing to pay. John offers the product for $100, which fits within your budget. It's time to move on and secure the deal with John."
