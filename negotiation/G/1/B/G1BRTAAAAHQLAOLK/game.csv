"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
