"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course, so please let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value this product brings to the table is substantial, and $1,200,000 undervalues it significantly.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,250,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
