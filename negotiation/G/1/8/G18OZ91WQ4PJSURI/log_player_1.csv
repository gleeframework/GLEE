Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while still exceeding my minimum selling price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate, which might make him feel like he's getting a better deal. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing John will buy it for $120, ensuring I don't make a loss."
