"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $150. Is this something you'd be interested in?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be interested in buying if the price were closer to $80. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $110 is still a little higher than what I can comfortably spend. Would you be willing to come down to $95? That's a good middle ground, and I think we can reach an agreement.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer it to you for $105. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting too close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer it to you for $100. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one more time.",100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really hoping we can reach a deal. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's make this happen.",95.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum price, and I think $95 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to consider other options.",105.0,Alice,9,
