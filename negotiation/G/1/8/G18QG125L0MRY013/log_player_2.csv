Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $110 is still a little higher than what I can comfortably spend. Would you be willing to come down to $95? That's a good middle ground, and I think we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is closer to my budget, it's still more than I'd like to spend, and I'm not sure Alice will come down much further. However, I'm confident that I can get a better price if I keep negotiating, or I can always fall back on buying from John for $80.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum price, and I think $95 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $105 is still above my target price of $80.  I'm not sure if she'll go any lower, and I'm running out of rounds. It's better to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $80.  I've managed to save a decent amount of money compared to Alice's initial offer."
