{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is a good price, you can likely get a better deal. You have 10 rounds to negotiate and your goal is to save as much money as possible. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can get closer to your ideal price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $9,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer of $12,000, but still higher than her value of $8,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while also demonstrating my intent to secure a good deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is better than $12,000, you can still aim for a lower price.  You've shown Alice you're willing to negotiate, and there are still rounds to go. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to potentially secure a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $10,000.  This is a compromise between my previous offer of $9,000 and Alice's current offer of $11,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but still seeking a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $10,500, which is a good price for me. It's still within my budget and a significant saving compared to John's price. There are still rounds left, but I'm happy with this offer and don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
