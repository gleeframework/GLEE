Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $110. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal!

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll go below $100. I can get the product for $100 from John, guaranteeing the best possible price and avoiding further negotiation."
