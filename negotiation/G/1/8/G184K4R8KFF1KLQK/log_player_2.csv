"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $10,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product for less from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

Bob is aiming to get the product as close to his budget as possible. $8,500 is a good starting point, leaving some room for negotiation. It's also a significant discount from Alice's initial price, showing his willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While it's still above his ideal price, it's significantly lower than her initial offer and close enough to his budget to make it worthwhile.  Rejecting again would risk Alice refusing to negotiate further, forcing Bob to buy from John at $8,000. This decision minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether."
