"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity! This product is a game-changer, and I believe its value to you is immense. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects the value it brings to your business, while allowing for a fair profit for me. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a little high.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $850,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for your business. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1,000,000. This price is still significantly below what you'd gain by using this product, and it gives us both a great deal. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,000,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $925,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal, and I respect that.  However, $925,000 still doesn't reflect the full potential of this product for your business. Let's compromise at $975,000. This price is fair for both of us, and it allows me to continue to believe in the value of this product. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
