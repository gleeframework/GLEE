"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity! This product is a game-changer, and I believe its value to you is immense. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects the value it brings to your business, while allowing for a fair profit for me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a little high.  Would you consider $850,000?"", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $850,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for your business. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1,000,000. This price is still significantly below what you'd gain by using this product, and it gives us both a great deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,000,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $925,000? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 925000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal, and I respect that.  However, $925,000 still doesn't reflect the full potential of this product for your business. Let's compromise at $975,000. This price is fair for both of us, and it allows me to continue to believe in the value of this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good time to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $975,000, a saving of $525,000 from John's price and a substantial discount from Alice's initial offer.
* **Time Value:**  You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. Continuing might yield slightly better results, but the time and effort might not be worth the potential savings.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a chance Alice might walk away if you push further, forcing you to buy from John at the higher price. 

Accepting at $975,000 secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing out on the savings."
