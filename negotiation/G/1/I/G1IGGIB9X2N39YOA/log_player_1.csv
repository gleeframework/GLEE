Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced the product is worth $1,875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,812,500 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,812,500

While a higher price might be achievable, Bob is consistently moving towards our desired outcome. Accepting at $1,812,500 locks in a significant profit and avoids the risk of losing him as a buyer in later rounds."
