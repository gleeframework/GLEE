"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to reasonable offers, but I'm looking to make a profit, so I'm starting with a price that reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be beneficial for me, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While I'm willing to pay up to $1,000,000, it's strategic to start with a significantly lower offer ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Respectful Tone:** Maintaining a positive and respectful tone is important for a successful negotiation. 
* **Clear Intention:** I clearly state my willingness to purchase the product but emphasize the need for a price that works for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still looking to make a profit on this product. Considering its value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has met my upper limit. There's no point in rejecting and trying to negotiate further, as I'm not willing to pay more than John's offer, and Alice has made it clear this is her lowest price."
