Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  He's not budging from $1,250,000, but I still believe I can get closer to $1,325,000. It's worth a few more rounds to try and squeeze a little more out of the deal."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We're down to the wire, and $1,275,000 is a good price, considering John is only offering $1,200,000.  It's a better outcome than walking away with nothing."
