"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to find some common ground.  Would you consider $950,000? ",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's as far as I can go. I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
