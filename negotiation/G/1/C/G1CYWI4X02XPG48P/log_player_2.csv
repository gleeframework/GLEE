"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal than $12,000.  Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price slightly above Alice's perceived value of the product, hoping to incentivize her to sell.  This offer also leaves some room for further negotiation if Alice rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly lower than John's, Bob can still potentially get a better deal.  He's willing to pay up to $15,000, so there's still room to negotiate with Alice and reach a price closer to his target.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and secure a lower price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing his willingness to negotiate but still aiming for a price below Alice's previous counteroffer. This gradual approach can help convince Alice to accept a price closer to her minimum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum budget, there's still a chance to get a better deal.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue the negotiation and try to lower the price further.  It's worth risking another round to see if Alice will budge closer to Bob's target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, demonstrating his seriousness in wanting the product while still keeping a significant margin below Alice's latest offer.  This gradual approach can incentivize Alice to compromise, as she's already seen that Bob is willing to negotiate but has a clear price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, there's still a chance to get a better deal.  Bob has already shown willingness to negotiate, and rejecting this offer can potentially make Alice more motivated to compromise in the next round.  Also, the time pressure is starting to mount as only 3 rounds remain.  The risk of losing out on a good deal is increasing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a significant jump in his offer, demonstrating his commitment to reaching an agreement.  This offer is still below Alice's current price, but it shows that Bob is serious about acquiring the product.  The remaining time pressure could encourage Alice to accept this offer, as it's a substantial improvement on previous rounds.  If Alice rejects, Bob will have one more chance to negotiate before resorting to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round of negotiations. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, the risk of not reaching an agreement is too high. With only one round left, there's a significant chance that Alice will reject Bob's final counteroffer.  Buying from John guarantees the purchase and avoids the possibility of walking away empty-handed.  Even though it's more expensive, it's the safest option at this point, as Bob's maximum budget is $15,000."
