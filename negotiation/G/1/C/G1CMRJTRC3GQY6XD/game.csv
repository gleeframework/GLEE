"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $100. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit tight on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $105? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to walk away, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about budget, but I'm still not comfortable going down to $105. How about we compromise at $108? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value, and it's a small step away from your original offer.",108.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going up to $108. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $108, which would be $106.50. Can you consider that?",106.5,Bob,6,
