Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. I'm asking for $1,190,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000,  trying to get a higher price from Bob is worthwhile. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,190,000 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a slight discount while still securing a substantial profit for me. 
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:**  I don't want to price Bob out completely. Offering a price slightly below my guaranteed sale price acknowledges that there's room for negotiation while still valuing the product appropriately."
