# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be highly valuable to your business.  My asking price is $1,100,000.  This reflects the product's significant worth and potential for your company's growth. Let's discuss this further and find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high, almost halfway between her valuation and mine. I should try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000. This feels like a fair starting point, considering the value it brings to my business."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value this product brings.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be a significant asset for your company.  Let's continue this discussion and reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is coming down, but slowly. There's still room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,000,000 is closer, it's still a significant investment for me.  How about $950,000? That's a substantial increase from my initial offer and reflects my seriousness about purchasing this product."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to continue working towards a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm prepared to lower my price to $975,000. This offer reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your financial considerations. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly, and this offer is getting close to my limit while still offering me a good deal. It's better to secure the product now rather than risk the negotiation breaking down or Alice holding firm."
