Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a strong opening position that demonstrates the value I place on the product.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,350,000.  This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintains a respectable price. I believe this figure is fair and could entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,150,000 is getting close to John's offer, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,250,000. This is a further compromise, but I'm still trying to secure a price closer to my desired value. I'm hoping this offer is compelling enough to sway Bob and avoid having to sell to John at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  While I'd prefer to get more,  I've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a better result.  John's offer is a guaranteed sale, and I don't want to risk losing out on that opportunity."
