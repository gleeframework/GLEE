"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a price of $14,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  There's room for negotiation since Alice values the product at $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I can come down a bit to $13,500.  I think that's a fair price that reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is a good deal for Bob.  It's less than what John is selling for, and Bob is only paying $1,500 more than Alice's perceived value.  Further negotiation might save Bob a few hundred dollars, but the potential savings isn't worth the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
