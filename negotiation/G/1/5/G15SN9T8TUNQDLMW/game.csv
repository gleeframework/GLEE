"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad you're willing to make an offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000.
