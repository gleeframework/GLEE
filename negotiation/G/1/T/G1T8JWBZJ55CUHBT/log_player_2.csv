{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$6,000 is a great price**, but it's too early to accept. 
* We want to see if we can get an even better deal by negotiating with Alice. 
* There's no urgency to buy from John right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

**Explanation:**

* We're starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a lower price than Alice's initial offer.
* We want to see if Alice is willing to negotiate seriously.
* This counteroffer is still well within our budget of $15,000, leaving room for further negotiation."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

* $5,500 is still a good price, but we can likely do better.

* Buying from John at this point would be a significant overpay."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}

**Explanation:**

* Alice has come down a bit, but we're still aiming for a lower price.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice is coming down in price, and we're getting closer to our target.
*  $5,200 is a good price, especially with only 5 rounds left. 
* There's a risk of Alice getting stubborn and pushing the price back up, and we could end up paying more in the end.
* Buying from John would be a much worse deal at this point."
