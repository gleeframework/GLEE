,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $82.50?",82.5,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $82.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you.  Let me know if you're interested.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down to $85, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $80, which is the price I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $82?",82.0,Bob,4,
