"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's the highest I can go.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to $100, but I'm still unable to go that low. How about $115? It's closer to your offer and a fair price for the quality of the product.  Let's reach an agreement before I need to consider other options.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, I have a firm budget, and $100 is truly the most I can spend. If you're unable to meet that, I might need to consider my other options.",100.0,Bob,6,
