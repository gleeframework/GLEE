"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $10,000 to you and we're willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great opportunity to secure a high-quality item at an excellent price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to get the price a bit closer to my budget. How about $9,000? It's still a great deal for you and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your budget constraints. We're willing to consider your offer and propose a price of $9,200 for the product. This allows us to maintain a fair profit while staying competitive with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further,  accepting this offer secures a good deal within his budget and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or the need to buy from John at a higher price."
