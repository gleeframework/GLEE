"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is still above your maximum budget and leaves you with less room for profit. 
* Rejecting her offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice at a lower price. 
* While you'd have to pay John $1,500,000, it's strategically better to see if you can get a better deal from Alice first."
