"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the significant benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,100,000
* **Your Maximum:** $800,000
* **John's Offer:** $800,000

While Alice's offer is lower than her product valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. Rejecting her offer opens the door for you to buy from John at your desired price."
