Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the significant benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, the goal is to get the highest possible price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for potential negotiation with Bob.  He might counter-offer, and there's still a chance to settle above the guaranteed $1,200,000.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but it's presented with confidence and highlights the product's benefits to justify the price.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible outcome for Alice."
