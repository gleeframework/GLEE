"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's maximum price. There are still rounds left to negotiate, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to establish a lower price point early in the negotiation. This aggressive approach puts pressure on Alice to compromise and demonstrates Bob's seriousness about getting a good deal.  It's important to note that this is a fairly aggressive counteroffer, but Bob has 9 rounds left to negotiate, so he can afford to take this risk."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still above his ideal price.  With rounds remaining, Bob has an opportunity to further negotiate and potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his maximum price point.  He's sending a clear message that he's not willing to go any higher, hoping to pressure Alice into accepting his offer. With 6 rounds remaining, Bob has time to see if Alice will budge."
