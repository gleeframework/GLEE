"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've put a lot of time and effort into, and I'm confident it could be a real asset for your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value you'll get from it, while still allowing me to make a decent profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You can get the product for $1,200,000 from Alice, which is significantly cheaper than the $1,500,000 from John.
* **You still save money.** Even at $1,200,000, you're buying the product for less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000."
