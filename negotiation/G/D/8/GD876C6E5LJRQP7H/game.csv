"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've put a lot of time and effort into, and I'm confident it could be a real asset for your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value you'll get from it, while still allowing me to make a decent profit. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
