"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 950000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible while still securing a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not ready to settle for $850,000 just yet. I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it's still significantly higher than John's offer. Hopefully, this will entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to push for the lowest price. At this point, his offer is the same as John's. Since I'm not willing to drop any further and I don't want to risk going through more rounds of negotiation, I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product to him. It's a guaranteed sale and I'm securing my minimum acceptable price."
