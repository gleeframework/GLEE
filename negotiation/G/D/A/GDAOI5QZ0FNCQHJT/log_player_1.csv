Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This price is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more.  It's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm offering a compromise price of $90. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $87 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $80. It's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better price, and risking further rejection to hold out for a slightly higher price is not worth it. Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice."
