"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is too high for me. Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement closer to that number.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value. To be frank, $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand the value you place on the product,  $2,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This shows my genuine interest in acquiring the product, but it's the highest I can realistically offer.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your understanding of the product's value. I've given this careful consideration, and to find a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered while acknowledging your position. Let me know if this works for you, as I do have other interested parties.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to offer $1,600,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in the product. I truly believe this is a fair price that we can both agree on.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
