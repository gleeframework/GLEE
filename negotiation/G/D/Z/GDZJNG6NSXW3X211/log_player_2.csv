"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.** Even though Bob's maximum value is $15,000, Alice's offer of $14,000 is still within his budget and saves him $1,000 compared to buying from John."
