,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm happy to pay $80 for the product, which is fair for both of us. What do you say?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think $120 is steep, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. How about we meet in the middle at $100? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a good deal",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $90? It's a good compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $90, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $95? It's a bit more than my minimum, but I think it's a fair price for a great product",95.0,Alice,5,
