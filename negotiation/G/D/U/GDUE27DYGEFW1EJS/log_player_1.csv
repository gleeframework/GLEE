I'm still aiming higher. While $900,000 is a good offer, I believe I can secure a better price in the remaining rounds."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Bob is getting very close to my initial ask, and $1,000,000 is a significant profit. It's a good balance between maximizing profit and the risk of him walking away if I push further."
