Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $110, Bob. If you're not willing to meet me at $80, I'm starting to think we're not a good match. I'll hold out for a better offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unwilling to budge from her $110 offer.  It's clear you've reached an impasse, and continuing to negotiate is unlikely to get you a better deal. Buying from John at $80 ensures you stay within your budget."
