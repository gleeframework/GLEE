Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming to leave room for negotiation. I believe that $14,000 is a reasonable starting point, and I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept it and avoid further negotiations, my goal is to maximize my earnings. I believe I can get closer to my target price by rejecting his offer and countering with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counter-offering with $12,500. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer, but still less than my initial offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer is now very close to my floor price of $12,000.  Accepting his offer will ensure a quick sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
