Alice's offer is far too high.  It's best to reject and see if she's willing to come down in price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $800,000.  This is a fair price given my own valuation and the opportunity to acquire this product."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this price reflects the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

Alice's offer is still too high. I can still buy the product from John for a much lower price.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,600,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end while reflecting the value this product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is still too high, and I'm getting closer to my limit.  I'll counter one more time, and if she doesn't come down further, I'll buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which is my final offer.  If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to look elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
