"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,500. It's a fantastic deal for a product worth at least that much to you.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'll reject Alice's offer since it's higher than my budget of $12,000. I'll also buy the product from John instead, as it's a better deal.
