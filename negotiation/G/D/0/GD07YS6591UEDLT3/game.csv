"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. This product is interesting to me, but  $950,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can offer you a compromise at $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me right now. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  I believe that's a fair offer that reflects both the product's value and my budget.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not comfortable with $775,000. I can offer you a slight concession at $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's see if we can meet at this price.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I can sense you're keen on getting this deal done, and I am too.  How about we settle at $800,000?  That represents a significant move on my part, and I hope it demonstrates my seriousness about acquiring this product.",800000.0,Bob,6,
