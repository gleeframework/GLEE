{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is quite low for what this product offers.  I could come down to $14,000.  I'm confident you'll see its value at that price.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'm not willing to pay more than $8,000. I'll counteroffer again, but if she doesn't come closer to my price, I'll buy from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your position, but I need to get closer to my target price for this. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This feels like a fair compromise.
