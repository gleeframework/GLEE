Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $16,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  This is my best offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is quite low for what this product offers.  I could come down to $14,000.  I'm confident you'll see its value at that price."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your position, but I need to get closer to my target price for this. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still only able to offer $8,000. It seems we're both stuck at our respective price points. Let's make a final attempt to find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is clearly anchored at $8,000 and unwilling to budge. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price acceptable to me. It's time to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
