,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $105. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll really appreciate it.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $105 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $85, and that's as low as I'm willing to go.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to pay $85, Bob, but I'm still not sure if that's enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $97.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to making a decision, but $97.50 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $92.50",92.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to go below $100. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, though. I can offer it to you for $98. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",98.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $98 is the lowest price you're willing to go. I'm willing to pay $95, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",95.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $100. I'm willing to make one last offer to you. I can offer it to you for $99. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",99.0,Alice,9,
