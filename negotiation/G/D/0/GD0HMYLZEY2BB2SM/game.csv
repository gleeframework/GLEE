"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I think this product could be a good fit for me, but $18,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is too low. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $15,000 is still a stretch for me.  Could you do $10,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle at $13,000? That's a strong offer and reflects the true value of this product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  $13,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. What if we split the difference and settled at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,6,
