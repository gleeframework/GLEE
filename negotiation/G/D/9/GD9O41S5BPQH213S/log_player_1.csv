{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've shown interest in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000.  This is a great price considering the value it provides.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so you're giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're not willing to go below $12,000, so this offer leaves room for counteroffers while still ensuring you get a good price.
* **It's clear and concise:** The message is straightforward and gets to the point. 

Remember, you can always adjust your counteroffers based on Bob's responses. Good luck!"
