Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a good starting point as it's more than my minimum price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I'll also keep John in mind as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $90 is higher than what John is offering, and it's closer to my desired price. It's a good deal for me, so I'll accept it."
