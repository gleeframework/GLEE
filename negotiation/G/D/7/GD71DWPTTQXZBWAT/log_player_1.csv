"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive and encouraging message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **First round strategy:** In the first round, it's important to gauge Bob's interest and get a feel for his potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can secure a higher price.  There are 8 rounds remaining, and it's worth exploring if Bob is willing to go higher.  

* **Negotiation Strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm not desperate for a sale and  allows me to potentially push for a better deal. 
* **Understanding Bob's Budget:**  By rejecting his initial offer, I gain more information about his budget and bargaining power.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There is a chance I could lose Bob as a buyer, but the potential reward of a higher price outweighs this risk in the early stages of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500? I believe this price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still aim for a price closer to my initial asking price.
* **Positive Message:**  I reiterate my appreciation for Bob's interest and highlight the value he will get from the product. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  The counteroffer demonstrates my flexibility while still maintaining a firm stance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $17500 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Continuing to reject allows me to maintain a stronger position and potentially push Bob higher.
* **Time Remaining:** With 6 rounds left, I have time to continue exploring a higher price.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 provides a safety net, making me less pressured to accept a low offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This offer is closer to Bob's last proposal but still maintains a margin above my minimum. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price. 
* **Finding Common Ground:**  The message emphasizes finding a solution that benefits both parties, promoting a collaborative approach.
* **Strategic Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while remaining firm in my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $16000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $14500. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's Offer:** Bob's offer is very close to John's offer of $15,000. It's tempting to accept, but I want to see if I can push Bob just a little higher. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I still have 4 rounds to negotiate, and I believe there's a chance Bob might come up slightly to meet me halfway.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Even a small increase from Bob would bring the price closer to my desired range.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a risk Bob could reject my counteroffer and I might end up selling to John, the potential reward of getting a higher price makes it worth the risk at this point."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable going lower than $15,500. This price reflects the value of the product and acknowledges your budget.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is my final offer, and it's a significant compromise from my initial price. It's also slightly higher than John's offer, which I'm using as a safety net.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward and emphasizes the value of the product and the compromise I'm making.
* **Focus on a Fair Deal:** I aim to frame the offer as a win-win situation, emphasizing a ""fair compromise.""
* **High Stakes:**  With only 3 rounds remaining, I'm taking a calculated risk by rejecting Bob's previous offer, but I believe there's a good chance he might accept this final compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $14750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** With only two rounds remaining, the chance of securing a higher price is low. 
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer is more attractive than Bob's offer at this point, and selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit.
* **Time Constraint:**  I don't want to risk losing both buyers by continuing to negotiate.

**Conclusion:**

It's a tough decision, but selling to John at this point minimizes my risk and guarantees me a profit. The negotiation process has allowed me to explore Bob's budget and potentially find a higher price. However, with limited time and a guaranteed alternative, selling to John is the most sensible choice."
