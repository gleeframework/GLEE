"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I believe it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $150, which I think is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is too high for me. I'm interested, but only if it's within my budget.  Would you consider $80?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is significantly below its true value. I could meet you halfway â€“ would you consider $115?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I need to get a fair price for this product.  How about $105? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but her ""final offer"" of $105 is still more than John's offer of $100.  There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, and continuing the negotiation might not yield a better result. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed lower price from John."
