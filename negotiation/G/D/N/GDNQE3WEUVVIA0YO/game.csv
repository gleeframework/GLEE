"Hi Alice,  $150 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still negotiating! I can see you're really interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'll try to find a middle ground again. I'll counteroffer at $110. Let me know if that works for you.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $110 is still outside my budget. Let's try $100.  If we can meet in the middle, I think we can close this deal.",100.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. Let's see if we can make it work.",105.0,Alice,7,
