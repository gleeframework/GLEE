Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to start the negotiations with a price of $1,300,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd like to counter with an offer of $1,100,000.  This would still give you a significant profit and leaves room for us to potentially reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
