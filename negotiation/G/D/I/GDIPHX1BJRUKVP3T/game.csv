"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 was a bit steep for you, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $11,000. How about we try $13,000? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really interested in this product, but $13,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's work together to get this done.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $12,500, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $13,200? It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's a fair price for this product, and it's still a good deal for you.",13200.0,Alice,5,
