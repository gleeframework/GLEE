Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $980,000, reflecting the value this product brings. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial. Let's make this deal happen!
