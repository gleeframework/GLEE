Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $145. I know you'll find it valuable, and this is a limited-time offer."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I could sell to John for $150 guaranteed, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below my minimum ($150) at $145 creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. He's getting a ""deal"" compared to my alternative. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this is a firm offer, starting slightly higher leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested, allowing me to potentially earn even more."
