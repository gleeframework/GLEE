Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My floor price:** $10,000, as that's what John will pay.
* **Bob's value:** $8,000, so I want to get as close to my floor price as possible.
* **Negotiation:**  Offering $9,500 gives me a good chance to get a higher price than Bob's value, while still remaining competitive.  

This strategy balances maximizing my profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. If he does, I can still sell to John at my minimum price."
