"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it represents a fair value for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While I recognize the product's value,  $1,150,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000, which I believe reflects a fair compromise. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. My revised offer is $1,120,000. I'm getting close to my minimum value, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle one more time.",1120000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're getting close to your minimum, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,120,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $1,105,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1105000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm afraid I've already compromised too much. I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach a deal. My revised offer is $1,115,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally agree on a price.",1115000.0,Alice,7,
