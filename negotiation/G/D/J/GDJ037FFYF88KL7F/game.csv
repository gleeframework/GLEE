"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget, but $100 is too low for me.  How about we settle at $130? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you're getting.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $85? I'm really interested in the product and I think we can find a mutually beneficial price.",85.0,Bob,4,
