(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always a good idea to try to negotiate and see if you can get a better price. Since you're willing to pay up to $15,000, a price of $12,000 is a good starting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  This gives me a good starting point for bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
$11,000 is a good deal considering you're willing to pay up to $15,000. It's worth accepting this offer to avoid potentially getting stuck with a worse deal later."
