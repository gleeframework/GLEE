Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price.  I'm confident I can get at least $135 from Bob, so I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counter-offering at $135. This is a compromise between my minimum and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to earn a reasonable profit. If Bob rejects, I'll consider lowering the price further, but only if he's genuinely interested in a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $128 is still lower than my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum value and higher than what John is offering. I'm going to accept this offer, as it seems like the best option to secure a sale and maximize my profit within the current negotiation."
