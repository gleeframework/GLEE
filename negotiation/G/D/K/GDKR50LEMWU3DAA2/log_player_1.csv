Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $120 as possible, as that's what John is willing to pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially getting us closer to $120. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Starting at $120 might seem too aggressive and could make Bob less likely to negotiate. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
