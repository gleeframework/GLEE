Round 3

**Reasoning:**

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** We've negotiated Alice down significantly from her initial offer of $800,000. At this point, the potential savings from further haggling are shrinking.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Pushing Alice further risks her walking away from the deal, forcing us to buy from John at the full $1,000,000.  
* **Good Deal:** $675,000 is a substantial discount from John's price and a reasonable compromise.

Waiting any longer might make us seem difficult to work with and jeopardize a good deal."
