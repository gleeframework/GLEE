"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love! I'm starting with a price of $140, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal. It's worth trying to negotiate further to potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $125. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer that is still above Alice's minimum acceptable price. This shows good faith while also leaving room for negotiation in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a great deal for a product you value at $150, and it's still above my minimum. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $135, which is within Bob's budget and a decent deal.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's risky given the limited rounds. Accepting the offer ensures he gets the product for a good price without potentially losing the deal or being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
