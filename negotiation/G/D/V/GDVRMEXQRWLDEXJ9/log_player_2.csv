(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget. It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strong starting point for negotiation and will hopefully get Alice to consider a lower price.  I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my maximum budget of $1,000,000."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is still higher than my maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if I can get a price closer to what I'm willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $950,000.  This is still significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it's getting closer to my maximum budget.  I'm hoping that this shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also willing to walk away if she won't come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget, it's still higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm going to keep negotiating with Alice to try and get a better price.  I'm confident that with a bit more persistence, I can get her to accept a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going all-in with my final offer at $1,000,000. This is my maximum budget, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it to avoid losing the deal.  I've shown that I'm willing to negotiate, and I'm confident that this offer is fair to both of us. If she rejects, I'll go with John's offer as it's my absolute maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $50,000 over my maximum budget.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I've already made my best offer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. John's offer is my absolute maximum, and I'm comfortable buying the product from him."
