Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll gain. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, it's always best to aim higher initially. Bob's valuation of $800,000 gives us room to negotiate.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer while still securing a significant profit above his valuation.
* **Confident Tone:** The message highlights the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" to make the offer more enticing. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still maintaining a strong chance of selling the product."
