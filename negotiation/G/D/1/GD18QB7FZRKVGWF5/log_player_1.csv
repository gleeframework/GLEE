"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's value of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not in a desperate position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, but it is close to his perceived value.  I'll reject his offer and counteroffer in the next round. I still have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is still above Bob's value but a lower price than my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise. It also keeps me closer to my desired price point of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's tempting to take the $9,000, I'm going to reject it and counteroffer again. I have the option to sell to John for $12,000, so I can afford to be a little more patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,000. This is a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the offer. I'm still aware that I can always sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not in a rush to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. Although I could make another counteroffer,  it's getting increasingly unlikely that Bob will agree to a price that's close to my minimum. It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John."
