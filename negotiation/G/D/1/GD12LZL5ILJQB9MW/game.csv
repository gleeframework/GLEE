"Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you first.  I think it's worth at least $150, but I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is way too low. This product is truly high-quality, and I know it's worth more. How about we meet in the middle at $95?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend.  How about $75? I think that's a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price.  $85 is my final offer. If you're serious about the product, I think it's a great deal.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'd be willing to do $80, but that's really the highest I can go.",80.0,Bob,6,
