"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You have no information about Alice's minimum acceptable price. It's worth exploring if you can get a better deal.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to accept a lower price, especially if you have a good counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $750,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price. It demonstrates your seriousness in negotiating and leaves room for potential compromise. This initial counteroffer allows for potential back and forth without immediately going too low."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $1,000,000 to $900,000, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, it's still a significant amount, and there's potential to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer and continuing to counter-offer keeps the negotiation going and could potentially yield a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're steadily decreasing the price while leaving room for further negotiation. This counteroffer of $800,000 is a compromise between Alice's last offer and our previous one.  It signals our willingness to reach a deal while still pushing for a better price."
