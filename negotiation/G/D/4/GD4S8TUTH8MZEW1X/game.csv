"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $15000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time.  I'd be happy to purchase it for $8000. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $10500 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  Would you be willing to do $9000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $10500, so I'm offering it to you for $9750. This is a compromise I'm comfortable with, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",9750.0,Alice,5,
