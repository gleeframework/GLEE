"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's something that I'm sure you'd find incredibly useful.  I'm offering it to you for $11,500, which is a fair price considering its worth to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is tempting, you can save more money by rejecting it. You know John is willing to sell the product for $12,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a better price with her. If she doesn't budge, you still have the option to buy from John and save $500."
