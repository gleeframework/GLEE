"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $11,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $11,000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $12,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,5,
