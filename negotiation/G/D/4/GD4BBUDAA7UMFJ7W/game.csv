"I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not sure I can go all the way to $7800. How about we try $8050?",8050.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $7500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8000.",7500.0,Bob,8,
