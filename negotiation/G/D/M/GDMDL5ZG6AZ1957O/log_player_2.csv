"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a starting offer of $6500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8000. I'm open to negotiating and finding a price that works for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $6,500 is a good deal, it's still more than Bob's desired price point.  It's worth exploring further negotiation with Alice to see if a lower price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $6,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $5,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 5500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $5500. Considering the product's value to you is $8000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $6000. This is a fair compromise that still gives you a good deal, while also ensuring I get a reasonable profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $6,000 is closer to his desired price, he can likely still negotiate a lower price. It's worthwhile to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $6,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $5,800. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal.  Let's see if we can close this gap and come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 5800}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $5800. Considering the product's value to you is $8000, I'm willing to offer $6100. This is a fair compromise that still gives you a good deal, while also ensuring I get a reasonable profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** $6,100 is very close to Bob's desired price point of $5,800.
* **Limited negotiation:**  There are only 5 rounds left, and Alice is already firm on her pricing.  Further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or a worse deal.
* **John's offer:**  Buying from John for $8,000 is significantly more expensive, making Alice's offer more attractive.

While Bob might prefer a slightly lower price, accepting Alice's offer ensures he gets the product at a reasonable cost while leaving some room for negotiation in the future if needed."
