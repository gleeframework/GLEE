"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a starting offer of $6500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8000. I'm open to negotiating and finding a price that works for both of us. What do you think?",6500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $6500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $5500. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",5500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $5500. Considering the product's value to you is $8000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $6000. This is a fair compromise that still gives you a good deal, while also ensuring I get a reasonable profit. What do you think?",6000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $6000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $5800. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal.  Let's see if we can close this gap and come to an agreement.",5800.0,Bob,4,
