Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000, reflecting its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $15,000, we want to get as close to that price as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Secure a Sale:** Offering it for a price significantly lower than $14,000 increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and forcing us to sell to John for $10,000. 

By offering the product at $14,000, Alice stands a good chance of securing a sale that yields a significant profit while still leaving a margin for negotiation."
