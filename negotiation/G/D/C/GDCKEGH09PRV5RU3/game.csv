"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I can do $1,000,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what you'll get out of it.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to an agreement, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle. I can do $950,000, and that's as close to the middle as I'm willing to go. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to pass up.",950000.0,Alice,5,
