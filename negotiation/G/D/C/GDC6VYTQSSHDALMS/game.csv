"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $130 for the product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $130. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $110 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do.",120.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to get the best deal. How about we meet at $115?",115.0,Bob,6,
