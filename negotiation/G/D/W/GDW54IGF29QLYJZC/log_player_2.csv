"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her ($1,200,000), and also significantly lower than your maximum budget ($1,500,000). This indicates there's room for negotiation, making it beneficial to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'd hoped.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:**  This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still higher than her minimum acceptable price. It demonstrates your serious interest but also sets a strong starting point for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:** The counteroffer leaves room for Alice to negotiate up, while also ensuring you get a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is positive and keeps the conversation open for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** Alice's offer is still higher than your desired price, but closer to your initial counteroffer.  This suggests she's willing to negotiate, and we can likely get a better deal.
* **No Immediate Need:** You have 7 rounds left, so there's no urgent need to accept this offer.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  This counteroffer is a smaller step up than your previous one, showing you're taking Alice's position into account.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer is still significantly lower than Alice's offer, but closer to the middle ground. It tests her willingness to compromise further.
* **Positive & Direct:** The message remains positive and emphasizes the desire for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go below $1025000. I believe the product's value is still higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1025000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing In:** Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price.  You're only $25,000 away from your target price.
* **Limited Time:**  You have 5 rounds left. It's getting riskier to keep rejecting offers, as you could run out of time and be forced to buy from John at a significantly higher price.
* **Reasonable Compromise:**  Accepting this offer is a reasonable compromise. While you could try for a lower price, the risk of losing the deal is increasing."
