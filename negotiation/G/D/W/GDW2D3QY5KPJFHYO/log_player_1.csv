Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I believe it's a fantastic deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $100.
* **John as Backup:** If Bob declines, we have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John.

Therefore, offering the product at $119 creates a win-win scenario:

* **Bob's Perspective:**  He gets the product for $19 less than his perceived value, a good deal.
* **Your Perspective:** You make $19 more than selling to John, maximizing your profit. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
