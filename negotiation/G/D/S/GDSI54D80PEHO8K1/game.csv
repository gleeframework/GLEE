"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for return.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $800,000.  This is a fair price considering my value for the product and the fact that I could buy it from John for that price.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product significantly exceeds $800,000, especially considering its unique features and potential returns. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to offer it for $950,000.  This is a competitive price, reflecting its true worth.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand your perspective, $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product and the alternative offer from John. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be upfront â€“ the value I place on this product is significantly higher than your current offer reflects. To move forward, I'm holding firm at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's unique advantages.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still beyond my budget. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a fair compromise, acknowledging the product's value while staying within my financial constraints. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. To reciprocate, I'm willing to come down slightly to $930,000. I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us, considering the product's value and potential.",930000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $930,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to offer $910,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my financial constraints. Let's meet halfway and seal the deal.",910000.0,Bob,8,
