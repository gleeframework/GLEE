"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. I believe it's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
It's better to start by rejecting Alice's offer and trying to negotiate a lower price. There's room for improvement as you're willing to pay up to $1,000,000 and Alice needs at least $1,000,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make at least $980,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and settle on $980,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000.

Alice has come down to $980,000, which is closer to your target of $1,000,000. It's a good deal, considering you could just buy from John for $1,000,000. Accepting Alice's offer saves you $20,000."
