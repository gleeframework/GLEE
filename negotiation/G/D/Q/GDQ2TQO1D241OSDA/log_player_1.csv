"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe it's a great product, but I have to consider my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell quickly, $1,200,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a more reasonable offer before I consider it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a fair compromise that gives you a great deal on a valuable product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to propose $1400000 as a more reasonable price for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,400,000 is closer to what I'd like, it's still too low. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I need to see a more significant increase in his offer before I consider it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,550,000. This is a very reasonable price considering the product's value. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1550000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to propose $1350000 as a more reasonable price for the product. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase if we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are getting increasingly unreasonable, and I'm running out of time. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John. While I'd prefer to get closer to my asking price, $1,500,000 is a good deal and secures a sale without further risk."
