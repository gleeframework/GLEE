"Bob, thanks for your response and your clear interest in the product. I understand your perspective on the price, but I believe $1,300,000 is reflective of its true value. To move forward, I'm willing to consider $1,150,000. This represents a significant adjustment on my end while acknowledging the worth of this product. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
