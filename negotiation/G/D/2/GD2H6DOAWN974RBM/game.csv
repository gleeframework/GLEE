"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer of $11,000. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,500. I'm still confident that the product's value to you is $15,000, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm now offering the product to you for $11,750. This is my final offer.",11750.0,Alice,5,
