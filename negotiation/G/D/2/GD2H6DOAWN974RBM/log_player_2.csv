I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer of $11,000. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,500. I'm still confident that the product's value to you is $15,000, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm now offering the product to you for $11,750. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good point to accept the offer. Alice seems firm on her price and while we could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are getting smaller. Accepting at $11,750 still nets a significant discount from John's $15,000 price."
