"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your initial offer,  $1,000,000 is too low for what this product delivers. I can be flexible, so how about we consider $1,600,000? This acknowledges the product's value while recognizing your interest.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
