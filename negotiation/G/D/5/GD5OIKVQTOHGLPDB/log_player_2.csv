"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Let's start with a fair price. How about $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are looking to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $110 is higher than your maximum budget of $100.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $100, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $110 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $105. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. Considering our previous discussions, how about we aim for a middle ground? I propose $107 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $107 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than your desired price.  You can try to negotiate further to reach a price closer to your target of $100. Since you have the option to buy from John for $100, there's no need to accept an offer that's still above your maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $100.  How about we split the difference and go with $103?  I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 103}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try $104. This price reflects a compromise while still ensuring a reasonable profit for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $104. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $104
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $104 is still above your maximum budget of $100. Since you have the option to buy from John for $100, there's no need to accept an offer that's higher. You can try to negotiate further and see if you can convince Alice to come down to $100 or very close to it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $104 is still a bit out of my budget.  My final offer is $100.  I'm ready to purchase at that price.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 100}
