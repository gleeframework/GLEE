"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $950,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product holds significant value, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  To be honest, $825,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be open to $760,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're getting closer, Bob. $760,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of $795,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
