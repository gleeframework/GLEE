I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value, leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to come close to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a higher price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,400,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counter-offer is getting too low for me. While it's still above my minimum, it's not worth risking further negotiation.  John is offering my minimum acceptable price, which is a safe and guaranteed sale."
