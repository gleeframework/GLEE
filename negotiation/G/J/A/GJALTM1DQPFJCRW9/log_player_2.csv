"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is significantly higher than I had in mind. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I've done extensive research and analysis on this product and its potential, and I'm confident it's worth substantially more. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000.  This is a testament to my desire to see this product in your capable hands, but I need you to meet me closer to its real worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,100,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big gap for me. I'm serious about buying this product, but it needs to make financial sense.  Would you consider $1,000,000? That's my firm limit."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your limit, but I'm afraid we're still quite far apart.  I've already made significant concessions to demonstrate my willingness to work with you. I'm prepared to consider a price of $1,800,000.  However, this is contingent on you being able to demonstrate to me how this product will generate substantial returns within your business model.  I need to see a clear path to justify such a discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to come down to a price that works for you. She's still significantly above your limit and is asking for justification for a discount.  You have a guaranteed option with John at $1,000,000.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
