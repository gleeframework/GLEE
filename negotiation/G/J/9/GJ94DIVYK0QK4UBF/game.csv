"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. Would you like to make an offer or accept my price?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. How about $125? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 is a bit high for you, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $175? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least that much for the product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  $175 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. How about we meet at $150? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy the product right now.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $170. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a decent profit. How about we meet at $170? It's still a good deal for you, and I'll be happy to sell it to you at that price.",170.0,Alice,5,
