You are still aiming for the $80 price from John.  You can try to negotiate with Alice a bit more, but if she doesn't budge, you're better off going with John."

You've reached a point where the negotiation isn't progressing much, and Alice is stubborn. It's time to cut your losses and go with John. You're only saving a few dollars at this point, and it's not worth risking further negotiation."
