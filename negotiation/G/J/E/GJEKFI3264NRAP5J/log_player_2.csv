"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's in great condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is offering it for $140. It's a good price, but you can try to get a better deal. You can counteroffer and try to get a lower price before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'd be happy to pay $130 for it.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $135?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it's still below what it's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $135 is a good deal for you. It's below your maximum budget and above Alice's minimum.  It's a good price, and there's a good chance you won't be able to get a lower price without risking losing the deal altogether."
