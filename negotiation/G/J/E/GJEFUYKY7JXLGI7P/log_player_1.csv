Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$20,000:**  This is a starting point that is higher than my minimum value of $15,000. It leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and positive. It highlights the potential value of the product to Bob and invites him to engage in the negotiation.

This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** The high initial price will help me understand how interested Bob truly is.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** The $20,000 price allows for a potential compromise without falling below my minimum.
* **Keep John as a backup:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage during the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $17000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  However, I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price. I believe there is still room for negotiation and I'm not ready to settle just yet. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,500? I'm confident this is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer is a compromise between my previous asking price of $20,000 and Bob's offer of $17,000. It shows a willingness to negotiate and aims to reach a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Highlighting value:**  I reiterate that the product is still a ""great deal"" for Bob, emphasizing its value to him.
* **Positive message:** The message remains friendly and encourages further discussion. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Find common ground:** The compromise offer demonstrates flexibility and seeks a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  By not accepting Bob's offer immediately, I'm still able to negotiate and potentially get a better price.
* **Keep John as a fallback:** The threat of selling to John at $15,000 gives me leverage in case Bob refuses my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $18500 is still a little high for me.  How about we settle at $17500? It's closer to my budget and a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $17,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I would prefer a bit more, continuing to negotiate could risk losing him as a buyer altogether.  Given his willingness to compromise and the fact that John is a guaranteed $15,000 sale, it's time to accept Bob's offer."
