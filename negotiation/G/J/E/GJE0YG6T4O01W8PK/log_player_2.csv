"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within his budget, it's still significantly higher than the product's worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for Bob in the first round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, but also wants to be reasonable.  A counteroffer of $950,000 is a 15% reduction from Alice's original price, leaving plenty of room for both parties to potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This counteroffer also reflects that Bob is serious about purchasing the product, but won't overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still higher than Bob's desired price point.  Since Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate, he can continue to try and get a better price.  Rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering again gives him more leverage to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to Alice's price point, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate.  A counteroffer of $1,000,000 is a reasonable compromise, and it leaves room for Alice to potentially accept while still getting a better price than her initial offer. This move maintains pressure on Alice while staying within Bob's budget."
