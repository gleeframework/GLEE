"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we settle on $9,500? This gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $8,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, I'm still hesitant to accept it. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. I'm hoping to find a middle ground between our offers."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's meet in the middle at $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 6

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. However, I'm aware that we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I'm willing to drop my price to $9,250. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my financial goals. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to save a bit more. How about we meet at $8,750? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the wire, and Bob's offer of $8,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm running out of time. It's better to sell to John at my minimum acceptable price than to risk getting a lower offer from Bob."
