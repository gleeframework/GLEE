"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $135 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",135.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $180 is a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $165.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $165 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $145,  which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $165 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $157.50.",157.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $157.50 is still slightly higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and settle at $153.75.  This seems like a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",153.75,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $153.75 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $157.50 and $153.75, so I'll sell the product to you for $155.625.",155.625,Alice,7,
