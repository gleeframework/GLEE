"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It aligns perfectly with your needs and has a potential worth of $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This price reflects its unique value and the potential for significant benefits. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message tries to highlight the product's value, you have a guaranteed option to buy the same product from John for $1,000,000. There's no reason to pay $50,000 more than you have to. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can proceed to buy from John and save money."
