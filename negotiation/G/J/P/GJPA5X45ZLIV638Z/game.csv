"Hey Alice, $160 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $120.  Would you be willing to come down to $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $130. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $140 is still a little more than I can afford. How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $145. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I get a decent profit. How about we meet at $142?",142.0,Alice,5,
