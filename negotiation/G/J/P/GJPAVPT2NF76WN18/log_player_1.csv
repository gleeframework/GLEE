Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000.  This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, as it's the value of the product to me.  While it's more than the product is worth to him, I'm hoping he'll see the value in owning it and be willing to pay my price. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept a lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a significant sum, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm confident I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's offer and closer to my desired price. I'm hoping to find a compromise that allows us both to walk away happy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $850,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than Bob's previous offer and it's a good return for me.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal. I'll accept Bob's offer."
