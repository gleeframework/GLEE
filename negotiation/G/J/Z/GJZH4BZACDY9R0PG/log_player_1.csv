Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,500,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1,300,000? This would allow you a healthy profit while keeping the price within my budget.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $1,350,000, which is a fair price considering our previous discussions.  This is my final offer before I have to consider other options.
