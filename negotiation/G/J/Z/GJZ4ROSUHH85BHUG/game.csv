"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but that price is a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $1,000,000 is tempting, I know the true value of this product. How about we settle at $1,200,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  $1,200,000 is still a little steep for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? I think that's a fair offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. How about we split the difference and land at $1,150,000? This is my final offer.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $1,150,000 is still a little too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to do $1,125,000.  This is my final offer.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
