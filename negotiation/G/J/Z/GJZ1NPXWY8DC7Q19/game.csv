"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying around $8,000. What would you say?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. However, $14,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind. Would you be open to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, it seems we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I can't accept $10,000, I'm willing to go down to $12,000. This is my final offer, as it reflects the true value of the product.",12000.0,Alice,5,
