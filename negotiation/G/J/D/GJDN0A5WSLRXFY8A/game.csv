"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the details you provided.  While the product sounds interesting, I'm not comfortable with the $20000 price point. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $20000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $16000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $14000.  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm still not comfortable going as low as $14000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16000 and $14000. I'm offering the product to you for $15500. This is a fair price that I think reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can finalize a deal at this price.",15500.0,Alice,5,
