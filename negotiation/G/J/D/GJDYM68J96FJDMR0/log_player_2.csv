"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think you'll agree that it's a truly unique opportunity. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above the value she places on the product ($800,000). There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest a bit less.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to invest a bit less, but I still think the product's value is worth more. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is a reasonable compromise. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and this offer is a significant savings compared to buying from John.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will walk away, and he'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
