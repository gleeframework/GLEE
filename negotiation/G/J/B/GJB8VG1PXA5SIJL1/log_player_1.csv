"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value, but I'm hoping to entice Bob into a negotiation and potentially get closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can nudge Bob up a little further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,750. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. I believe this price is still within the range of a possible deal, and it might incentivize Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not at the point where I'd be happy to accept. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to budge a little more. I have a few rounds left, so I'm not in a rush to accept just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to stick with my last counteroffer of $9,500. It seems like Bob is willing to negotiate around this price point, and I'm hoping he'll finally accept. If not, I have a few more rounds to try and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum but I don't have enough rounds left to risk further negotiation. John's offer is significantly better, and it's time to take the secure deal."
