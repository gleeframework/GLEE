"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this unique product for a price of $1,000,000.  While it's worth more to me, I believe this is a fair price that recognizes its value to you.  Consider this a chance to acquire something valuable for a price that's significantly less than its true worth.  Let me know your decision.
