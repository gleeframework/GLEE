Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my asking price.  $10,000 is too low."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to his price, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm hoping he'll come up a little more in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $11,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $11,500.  This is my final offer, and I truly believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob is unwilling to budge much further, and I'm getting closer to my minimum selling price.  Rather than continue to negotiate and risk losing even more time and potentially getting a worse deal, I'm going to sell to John for $12,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's a secure deal that guarantees me my minimum acceptable value."
