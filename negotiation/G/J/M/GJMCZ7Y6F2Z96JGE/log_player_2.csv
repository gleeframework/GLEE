Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $725,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a good value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

While Alice is coming down on price, she's unlikely to go much lower than $850,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial to go with the guaranteed $800,000 price from John."
