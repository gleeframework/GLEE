{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're still getting more than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob has an incentive to negotiate as he can potentially get the product for less than $1,200,000.
* **It shows confidence:** You're not starting at the lowest possible price, demonstrating that you believe your product has value. 

Remember, this is just the beginning of the negotiation. You'll need to be flexible and adapt based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a decent price, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer of $1,100,000. You're not under immediate pressure to sell, so there's no need to settle for a lower price right away. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Maintain leverage:** You show Bob that you're not desperate to sell and that you're willing to walk away if he doesn't meet your expectations.
* **Explore counteroffers:** You can test the waters with a counteroffer and see if you can reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Maintain the possibility of selling to John:** You still have the backup option of selling to John for $800,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** You're showing a willingness to meet Bob halfway by lowering your price from $1,100,000 to $1,000,000. 
* **Maintain value:** You're still getting a significantly higher price than John's offer of $800,000, ensuring you're not losing out. 
* **Maintain leverage:** By not accepting Bob's offer immediately, you're signaling that you're not desperate and are willing to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $920,000 is closer to your minimum of $800,000, it's still too low.  You're close to your minimum, but the negotiation is still in your favor. Rejecting this offer will allow you to:

* **Maintain leverage:** You show that you're not willing to settle for a price that's significantly less than your desired outcome.
* **Explore potential higher counteroffers:** Bob may be willing to go up slightly to reach a deal. 
* **Keep the option of selling to John:** You haven't lost the opportunity to sell to John for $800,000 if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

You can counter with a slightly lower offer than your previous $1,000,000, maybe $975,000.  This demonstrates your willingness to compromise while maintaining a profitable sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $920,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to come to a mutually agreeable solution. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer shows you're willing to lower your price from $1,000,000, but you're still maintaining a significant profit.
* **Fairness:** The price is closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a desire to reach a deal.
* **Maintain leverage:** You're not accepting his offer outright, which keeps you in a strong negotiating position. 
* **Signal willingness to close:** By proposing a specific price, you're showing Bob that you're ready to reach an agreement. 

This counteroffer is a good balance between maintaining your desired profit and increasing the chances of reaching a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my finances. Can we meet at $940,000 instead? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While you've been holding out for a higher price, the negotiations have reached a point where Bob is unlikely to budge much further.  $940,000 is still a significant profit for you, and it's closer to your minimum of $800,000 than John's offer. 

Here's why accepting is the best move:

* **Profitable deal:** You're still making a substantial profit compared to your minimum.
* **Risk of losing a deal:**  Bob may walk away if you reject his offer again. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag the process out, potentially costing you time and the opportunity to secure a sale.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a profitable sale while minimizing risk and maximizing your potential earnings."
