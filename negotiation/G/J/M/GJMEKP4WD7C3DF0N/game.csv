,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $920,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to come to a mutually agreeable solution. Let's see if we can close this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my finances. Can we meet at $940,000 instead?",940000.0,Bob,6,
