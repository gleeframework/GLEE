Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000 and I have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, I want to start negotiations significantly higher. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I don't settle for less than my minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value to encourage Bob to consider a price higher than his initial valuation. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone remains open for discussion, allowing Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price within my desired range.

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while acknowledging the possibility of negotiation with Bob."
