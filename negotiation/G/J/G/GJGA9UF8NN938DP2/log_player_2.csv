"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. 
* Alice's offer of $9,000 is better than John's offer of $10,000.
* However, you can still try to get a better price from Alice.  You can counter-offer and see if she's willing to go lower."
