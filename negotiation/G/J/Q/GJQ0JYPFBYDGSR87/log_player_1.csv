Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's value:**  He's willing to pay up to $80, so $130 gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** It leaves you with some wiggle room in case Bob negotiates down.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This helps keep the negotiation focused. 

I'll be watching for Bob's response and ready to negotiate further or move on to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $130 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $150.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you taking an interest in my product.  While $85 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100.  This still leaves me some room to make a profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

This counteroffer is:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** It shows I'm willing to compromise while still maintaining a decent profit.
* **Lower than my initial offer:**  It indicates I'm flexible and open to negotiation.
* **Clear and concise:** It keeps the communication focused on the price.

I'm hoping Bob will accept this counteroffer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating or sell to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my original offer of $85.  If that doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has made it clear that he's not willing to go above $85.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of getting stuck with a price lower than my minimum value is high.  I'm going to take John's offer of $150, which ensures I meet my minimum.  It's the most sensible choice, as I can't be certain of getting a better deal with Bob."
