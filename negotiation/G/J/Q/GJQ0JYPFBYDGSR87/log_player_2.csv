"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

It's better to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. You can potentially get a better deal than $130, and you have the option to walk away and buy from John if Alice doesn't meet your price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $130 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you taking an interest in my product.  While $85 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100.  This still leaves me some room to make a profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

While $100 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better deal.  You can always buy from John if the negotiation falls through."
