{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but lower than your minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate without feeling like he's being lowballed, while still allowing you to potentially get a better price than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair price that's closer to my budget and closer to your desired price.
