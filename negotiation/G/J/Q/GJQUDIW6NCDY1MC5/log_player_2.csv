You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would allow me to get closer to my desired price while still giving you a good deal.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still above my budget of $8,000. While it's a good deal, I'm not willing to pay that much. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,250 is still above my budget of $8,000.  While it's getting closer to a good deal, I'm unwilling to pay more than $8,000. I'm going to buy the product from John for $8,000 to ensure I stay within my budget."
