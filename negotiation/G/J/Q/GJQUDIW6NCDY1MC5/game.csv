"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would allow me to get closer to my desired price while still giving you a good deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair price that's closer to my budget and closer to your desired price.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  However, $8,750 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $9,250. This would be a good compromise for both of us, and allow me to get closer to my goal.",9250.0,Alice,5,
