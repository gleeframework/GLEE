Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000. This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this unique opportunity. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I'm open to negotiation, $1,000,000 is significantly lower than what I need to get for the product.  I believe there's room for us to find a price that's more favorable to both of us.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if necessary."

I'm selling the product to John for $1,500,000.  Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is still below my minimum threshold.
