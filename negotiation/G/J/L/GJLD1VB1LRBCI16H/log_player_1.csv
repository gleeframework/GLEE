Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. How about $1,350,000?

I'm going to try to squeeze out a bit more value from Bob. While $1,350,000 is a good deal, it's not my ideal price. I'll counter his offer in the next round."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher number. I'm going to counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

At this point, with only two rounds left, it's best to secure the deal.  Bob's offer is only $500 less than my previous counteroffer, and getting closer to my desired price.  It's not a huge difference, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
