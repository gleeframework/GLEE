{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, showing his willingness to negotiate.  He's aiming for a price that's more favorable to him but still leaves room for potential compromise.  This also signals to Alice that he's serious about getting the product at a lower price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

```

Bob is making a more moderate counteroffer this time. He's acknowledging Alice's compromise but still trying to get a better price. This approach shows flexibility and a willingness to find a middle ground. He's also emphasizing the benefit for both parties to reach an agreement."
