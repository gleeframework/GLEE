"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,000 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $8,500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate the effort, but $7,750 still isn't close enough to what I need.  How about we try $8,250?  That's a reasonable compromise that will allow us both to walk away satisfied.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  To be honest, my budget is getting tight.  I can offer you $7,900.  This is a strong offer and I think it's a fair deal.",7900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but $7,900 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further.  How about $8,100? This is a fair offer that meets both our needs.",8100.0,Alice,7,
