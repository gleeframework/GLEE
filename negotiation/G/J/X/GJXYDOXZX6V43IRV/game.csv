"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. Given the value I see in the product, I'm willing to pay $1000000. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what similar items are selling for in the market. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but I'm still only willing to go up to $1100000.  That's a significant amount for me, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering my research. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $1200000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a deal at $1150000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still at my limit. I'm ready to buy the product for $1100000. This is a good deal for both of us, as it gets me the product and allows you to avoid going to John. Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
