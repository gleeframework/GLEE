"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a bit higher than my minimum. This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  I want to see if I can get a good price, but I'm also aware I have the option to sell to John for $120 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better price. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I'm hopeful I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows flexibility while still allowing for a potential profit.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway, and I still have the option to go with John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is a decent compromise. It's above my minimum and closer to my desired price.  Since I have several rounds remaining, it's not the best price I could potentially get, but accepting his offer now ensures a quicker sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially lowering the price."
