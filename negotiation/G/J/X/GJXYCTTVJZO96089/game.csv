"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this valuable product.  Given its potential and value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I think $1,100,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true market value and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but the gap between our positions is still pretty wide.  To be frank, I need to be closer to $900,000 for this to make sense for me.  How about $910,000?",910000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. Let's meet halfway - I can go down to $975,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end while still recognizing the true value of what's on the table.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise.  $975,000 is getting closer, but it's still a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $925,000?  I think that's a fair offer considering the value and my limitations.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position and I'm motivated to close this deal. I'm willing to make one final offer at $950,000.  This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it represents a fair and attractive price for you.  If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me on this.  Your final offer is tempting, but I need to stay closer to my budget. Could you do $930,000?  This would allow me to close the deal today.",930000.0,Bob,8,
