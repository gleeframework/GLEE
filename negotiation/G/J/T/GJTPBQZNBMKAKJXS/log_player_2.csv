# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll see.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your budget constraints, $750,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.
