Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $750,000? I believe this would still provide a good return for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still feel that $900,000 is a bit high for my current budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? Perhaps $850,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.
