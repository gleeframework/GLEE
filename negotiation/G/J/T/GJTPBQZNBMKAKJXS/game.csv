"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll see.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $750,000? I believe this would still provide a good return for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your budget constraints, $750,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $900,000. This allows me to recognize your interest while still reflecting the true worth of what I'm offering.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still feel that $900,000 is a bit high for my current budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? Perhaps $850,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
