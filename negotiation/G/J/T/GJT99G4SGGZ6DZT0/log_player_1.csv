Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond this point, and further negotiation risks losing the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  It's time to cut my losses and take the sure thing."
