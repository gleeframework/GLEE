"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring significant value to your life. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $5,000.  I believe this offer represents a fair deal considering its value to me.",5000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to my budget.  To be totally transparent, I can purchase the product from another seller for $8,000.  I'm willing to pay a bit more to work with you, so how about we settle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you have other options, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $7,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $8,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $8,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
