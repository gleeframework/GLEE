"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a price that reflects its true worth. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my valuation and the potential for both of us to make a deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value it brings to you and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which I believe is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. This is a firm offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I think this price is still a fair reflection of the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $950,000, which would be $1,000,000. This is my final offer. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
