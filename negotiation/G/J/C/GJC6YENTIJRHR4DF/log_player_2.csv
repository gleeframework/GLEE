"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal, you can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice. You have a significant margin to work with ($300,000) before reaching your maximum budget. Rejecting the initial offer allows you to initiate a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It demonstrates your serious interest in purchasing the product while also pushing for a price closer to Alice's likely minimum acceptable price.  This leaves space for Alice to counter with a price that might be agreeable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a good price. It's within your budget and significantly lower than John's price. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice might reject your next counteroffer, leaving you with only the option of buying from John at a much higher price. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price and avoids the potential for a worse outcome."
