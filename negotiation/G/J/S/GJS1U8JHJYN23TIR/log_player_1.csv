Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. It's a great product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum of $120, especially since I have 8 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about $110? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $110. Would you be willing to meet me at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I have 6 rounds remaining, and I believe I can still achieve a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $105 is still a bit too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $107.50. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit away from my target. Would you be willing to go down to $105? I'm really interested in the product, and I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's time to sell to John. We've reached a point where Bob is unwilling to budge, and my minimum price is $120. With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiation is too high, and I'm better off securing the guaranteed $120 from John."
