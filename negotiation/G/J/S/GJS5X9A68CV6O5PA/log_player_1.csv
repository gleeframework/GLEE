"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit while leaving room for negotiation. I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's still far below my minimum value. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, and John is always a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still aiming for a considerable profit.  This counteroffer shows flexibility, but also that I'm not willing to go too low just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I believe there's room for negotiation and I'm not yet ready to settle for that price. I'll counteroffer again and see if Bob is willing to come up a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm making a slightly lower counteroffer, but I'm still above my minimum price.  This is my last attempt to get a price closer to my ideal before considering selling to John.  If Bob doesn't budge, I'll have to decide whether to accept his last offer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is tempting, it's still slightly below my minimum value.  I'm going to counteroffer one more time. If Bob rejects, I'll sell to John.  I only have a few rounds left and don't want to risk getting a lower price than what John is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

This is my final counteroffer. If Bob rejects it, I'll sell to John. It's a slight concession, but it allows me to still get a decent profit while minimizing the risk of losing out on a better offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, and I don't have time for more rounds of negotiation.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, and I'd rather not risk getting a worse offer from Bob.  I'm also getting a bit tired of these negotiations."
