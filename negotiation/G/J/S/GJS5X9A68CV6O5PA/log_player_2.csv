"Round 1

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's roughly half of Alice's initial price. This is a significant reduction, but it still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to signal that I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to get a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it below my maximum budget. I'm trying to show Alice that I'm willing to compromise and that I'm getting closer to her desired price point. This could encourage her to accept a deal sooner rather than risk going through more rounds of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, even though it's getting closer to what I'm willing to pay.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but only slightly. I'm getting closer to Alice's desired price point, and I want to see if she's willing to meet me halfway.  I'm still within my budget, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of needing to close the deal before I run out of rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, I'm still not willing to pay more than $1,000,000. I believe I can still get a better deal. I have a few more rounds to go, so I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer, and it's my maximum budget. I'm hoping that Alice will accept it, as she's already made significant concessions. If she rejects it, I will purchase from John, as I'm not willing to go over my budget."
