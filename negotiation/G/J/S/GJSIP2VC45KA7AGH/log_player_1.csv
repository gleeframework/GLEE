"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefits for Bob to encourage acceptance.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not going for the full $12,000 immediately, as this is likely to be rejected outright.  

By starting with a higher offer and leaving room for negotiation, I hope to maximize my potential profit while still keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, I'm really looking to spend no more than $8000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While I'd like to make a deal, Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  We are only in round 2, and I have 8 rounds left to try and reach a mutually agreeable price.  
* **Potential for a higher counteroffer:**  I can likely offer a counter-offer that is closer to my minimum, but still leave room for further negotiation.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and increase the potential for a better outcome for myself."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, I'm not able to go that low just yet. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still confident it's a great price for a product of this quality. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm not immediately accepting Bob's offer, but I'm also not completely rejecting his offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Meeting him halfway:** I've moved my price closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the value:** I reiterate the product's value to emphasize that $9,500 is still a good deal for Bob.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $9500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a near-optimal price:**  $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 than Bob's previous offer of $8,000.
* **Closing the deal:**  We're in round 4, and further negotiations might drag on, potentially risking losing the deal altogether.
* **Time is money:** Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale and move on to other opportunities.

While I'd prefer to sell for closer to $12,000,  accepting $9,000 is a reasonable outcome considering the time constraints and the potential for a longer negotiation."
