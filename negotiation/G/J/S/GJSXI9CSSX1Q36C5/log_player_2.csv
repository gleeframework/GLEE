"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to reject the initial offer. There's a chance Alice is willing to go lower, and you have 9 more rounds to negotiate. Buying from John at this point wouldn't give you any potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $8,000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:** A $2000 drop from Alice's initial price is significant but not so extreme that it seems insulting.
* **Focus on your needs:**  The message highlights your budget limitations and presents a price that fits within your maximum spending limit. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  While $8,000 is your ideal price, you haven't set a hard limit, keeping the possibility of further negotiation open."
