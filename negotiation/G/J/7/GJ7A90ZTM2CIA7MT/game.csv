"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great deal for you at a price of $120. Would you like to make it yours?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $100?  That's still a good deal for you, and within my budget.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product, and I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price that should work for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  I'm still a bit above my target price. How about we split the difference at $105?  That's a fair compromise for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $105 yet. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product. How about we try $112? It's a small step down from my previous offer, but it's still a price that reflects the value of the product.",112.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $112 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $108. It's a small step closer to my target price, and I believe it's still a fair price for a product you're willing to sell for less than $150.",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet at $115? It's a bit above your last offer, but it's still a price that I'm comfortable with.",115.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still too high for me. Let's compromise one last time and meet at $110. That's a fair price for both of us and gets this deal done.",110.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already met you at $110 in a previous round, Bob. I'm not willing to go back to that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but it's going to be my last one. How about $117? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but it's still a price that I'm comfortable with.",117.0,Alice,9,
