Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic pricing:** Offering the product slightly below John's price ($1,400,000) creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob. 
* **Respecting Bob's valuation:** While you know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, pricing it too close to that might make him feel pressured or undervalued.  

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your potential earnings and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
