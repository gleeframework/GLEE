"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm subtly highlighting the value of the product to Bob, hoping to make him reconsider his initial assessment. 

**Strategy:**

This is a high opening offer, aiming to gauge Bob's interest and see how much room there is for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to lower the price gradually in subsequent rounds, but I'll also keep John's offer of $15,000 in mind as my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm not eager to sell to John right away, I need to be strategic. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open. I'll use the next round to make a counteroffer, aiming to find a price point that is more appealing to Bob while still being within my acceptable range. I'll use this opportunity to push back on Bob's low offer and hopefully secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, but that's my absolute bottom line. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what the product is truly worth. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counteroffer of $10,000, which is a significant step down from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth more than his initial offer, subtly pushing him to reconsider.
* **Compromise:** I'm using the language of compromise to signal that I'm willing to work with him to reach a fair deal.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer. By presenting this as a compromise, I hope to encourage Bob to accept my counteroffer and avoid the need for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price range.  I'm not willing to sell at that price just yet. I want to see if I can push Bob a bit further, as we're still early in the negotiation process.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'll aim for a price that's closer to my minimum, but also acknowledge Bob's willingness to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,000, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we can both walk away happy.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm suggesting a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's current offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still securing a price closer to my desired range.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I'm framing this offer as a fair deal for both of us, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting we ""close this deal,"" aiming to motivate Bob to accept. 

**Strategy:**

This is a strategic move to see if I can quickly close the deal without further negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to adjust my strategy in the next round based on his response."
