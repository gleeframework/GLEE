"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $20,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **Positive Framing:** I use positive language (""fantastic product"") to make the offer more appealing.
* **Open Ended:** I don't give Bob a yes/no answer. This encourages him to engage in a discussion and potentially reveal his own valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I am very interested, but I can only afford to pay up to $15000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  Bob's offer is my absolute minimum. I want to see if I can get more.
* **Exploring Options:** Rejecting allows me to send a counteroffer and potentially get a price closer to my initial asking price.
* **Risk Assessment:** While selling to John is a guaranteed $15,000, I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob for the potential of a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $15,000 is just too low for me. How about $17,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $20,000 to $17,500.
* **Justify the Price:** I reiterate the value of the product to support my counteroffer.
* **Moderate Position:**  This price is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but allows for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to counter with $16000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob has come up to $16,000, which is only $1,500 away from my previous offer. This suggests he's serious about buying and we're getting close. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try for a higher price, there's a risk he'll walk away.  Accepting his offer guarantees a profit of $1,000 over my minimum.
* **Time is Money:** With only 6 rounds left, accepting this offer reduces the chance of reaching the deadline and having to sell to John for my minimum price."
