Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum acceptable price is $150. I want to leave some room for negotiation, but also ensure I get a good price.  I'll see if Bob is willing to bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$120 is way below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering at $175. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price and agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $145 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal.  I'm going to counteroffer one more time to see if I can get a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm counteroffering at $160.  I'm getting closer to Bob's price, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. I believe this is a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $155 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I would like to get more, I'm happy to accept this offer and move forward with the sale.  There's a chance he won't accept a counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
