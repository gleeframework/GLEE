I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to consider the offer."

Round 2
Bob's offer:

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell the product for less than my minimum value of $15,000.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not sure I'll be able to get him any higher.  I've only got 4 rounds left, and I'm running out of time.  I'd rather take the sure thing and sell to John for $15,000."
