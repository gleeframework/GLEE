{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. It's far too high for your budget.  You can try to negotiate a better price with Alice or go straight to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

This counteroffer represents your maximum budget and leaves no room for negotiation.  You are essentially challenging Alice to either accept your price or lose the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget.  You can try to negotiate a lower price again, but there's no guarantee she will accept.  You're getting closer to your desired price, so it's worth another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

You're raising your offer slightly, demonstrating your willingness to compromise but still staying within your budget. This puts pressure on Alice to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high, even though she has moved closer to your desired price.  You should try to negotiate a lower price again before considering buying from John.  You're getting closer to a deal, so it's worth persisting with the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

You are showing persistence and willingness to compromise by raising your offer again.  You're now very close to your maximum budget, so this is likely your final counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high, and you've already made multiple counteroffers.  While continuing to negotiate is an option, it's unlikely Alice will go lower than $1,000,000, which is still above your budget.  To avoid further negotiation and ensure you get the product within your budget, buying from John is the best option."
