Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $9,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A slightly lower price than $10,000 allows for some back-and-forth if Bob tries to negotiate.
* **Strong Alternative:** You have a solid backup offer from John at $8,000, giving you leverage.

This strategy balances ambition with the security of knowing you have a guaranteed sale at a good price if Bob declines."
