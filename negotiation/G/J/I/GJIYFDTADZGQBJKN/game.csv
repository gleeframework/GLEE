"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $5000 for it.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 might be a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $12000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $12000 is still a bit out of my range. I'd be willing to pay $8000 for the product. I'm really interested in it, and I think it's worth it to me at that price.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to make a significant compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $8000. I'm offering the product to you for $10000. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $8000, which would be $9000. I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $9500. It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, Alice, but I'm still not sure if $9500 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. I think that's the maximum I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",8500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to pay $8500, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $9000. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I've reached my budget limit. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying from someone else.",8000.0,Bob,10,
