"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,250,000.
