Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, aiming slightly higher with Bob could net you a better profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly interested, potentially landing you somewhere between $145-$150.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The price is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($120), but the message aims to pique his interest by highlighting it as a ""great deal."" This approach could work if the product holds additional value not immediately apparent to Bob.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, the potential for a higher profit margin makes this a calculated risk worth taking."
