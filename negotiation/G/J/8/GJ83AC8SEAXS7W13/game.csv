,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if you're willing to come down significantly.  How about $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $5,000 is far too low. This product is incredibly valuable. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price. However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider something closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your interest, but $7,000 is cutting it too close.  I could be persuaded to part with it for $8,500 - that's a very fair offer.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting close! I'm willing to make this work, but $8,500 is a bit of a stretch.  How about we settle at $7,800, and we have a deal?",7800.0,Bob,6,
