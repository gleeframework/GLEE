"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it gives you a significant return on investment and ensures I get a fair price for something I value highly. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This price is fair for both of us, as it gives you a profit and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still provides you with significant value and allows me to get closer to my goal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This offer is a fair compromise, allowing both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's work together to find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, which is a reasonable compromise. This price still gives you a fantastic deal and allows me to get closer to my goal. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer!  I'm still aiming for $1,050,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,062,500. This offers a fair compromise for both of us, allowing us to close the deal quickly.  Let's make this happen.",1062500.0,Bob,6,
