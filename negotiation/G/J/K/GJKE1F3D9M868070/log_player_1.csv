"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, knowing that Bob values the product at $80.  I want to see if I can get close to my desired price in the first round.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit too high for my budget, I'm looking to spend closer to $60 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $100.  While I could accept his offer and get something, it's not worth the risk of losing a potential higher offer.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is just too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is my absolute minimum. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum, it's still below it.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can push Bob higher before moving on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $75 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to go up slightly to $78, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $100.  While Bob has offered $78, which is closer to my minimum, it's still below it.  I've already made several counteroffers, and it's clear that Bob isn't willing to go much higher.  I don't want to risk losing John's offer, which is my minimum and gives me a guaranteed sale."
