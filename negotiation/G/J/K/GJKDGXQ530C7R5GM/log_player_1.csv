Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. It's a great product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer matches John's, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While $1,200,000 is a strong offer, I believe its true value is significantly higher. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the unique benefits and potential the product offers."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000, but I'd like to discuss a maintenance contract that would cover the remaining value of the product after the initial purchase price. This would give me more confidence in the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is clearly interested and is trying to find ways to justify the purchase.  I'll use his interest in a maintenance contract as a bargaining chip to increase the price slightly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire for a maintenance contract and I'm open to discussing that. However, including such a valuable service would need to be reflected in the product's price. To accommodate both of our needs, I propose a final price of $1,275,000. This allows us to move forward with the deal and explore a mutually beneficial maintenance agreement."",
""product_price"": 1275000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I'd like to propose a compromise on the maintenance contract. Instead of including the full value of the product, I'd like to propose a separate maintenance contract that covers 50% of the product's value for a set period of time. This would still provide me with some protection and support, but at a lower cost. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is very unlikely to go above $1,200,000.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing him as a buyer.  It's best to accept his offer now and secure the sale at the same price John is offering."
