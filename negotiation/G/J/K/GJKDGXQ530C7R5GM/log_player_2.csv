Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While $1,200,000 is a strong offer, I believe its true value is significantly higher. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the unique benefits and potential the product offers.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000, but I'd like to discuss a maintenance contract that would cover the remaining value of the product after the initial purchase price. This would give me more confidence in the deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a maintenance contract and I'm open to discussing that. However, including such a valuable service would need to be reflected in the product's price. To accommodate both of our needs, I propose a final price of $1,275,000. This allows us to move forward with the deal and explore a mutually beneficial maintenance agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm willing to meet her at $1,200,000, but I'd like to propose a compromise on the maintenance contract. Instead of including the full value of the product in the contract, I'd like to propose a separate maintenance contract that covers 50% of the product's value for a set period of time. This would still provide me with some protection and support, but at a lower cost.
