"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. It's a great product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While $1,200,000 is a strong offer, I believe its true value is significantly higher. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the unique benefits and potential the product offers.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000, but I'd like to discuss a maintenance contract that would cover the remaining value of the product after the initial purchase price. This would give me more confidence in the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a maintenance contract and I'm open to discussing that. However, including such a valuable service would need to be reflected in the product's price. To accommodate both of our needs, I propose a final price of $1,275,000. This allows us to move forward with the deal and explore a mutually beneficial maintenance agreement.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I'd like to propose a compromise on the maintenance contract. Instead of including the full value of the product, I'd like to propose a separate maintenance contract that covers 50% of the product's value for a set period of time. This would still provide me with some protection and support, but at a lower cost.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
