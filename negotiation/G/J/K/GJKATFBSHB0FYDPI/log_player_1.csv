Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be interested in.  I'm asking $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum value to give me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and inviting tone to make Bob feel comfortable negotiating.
* **Open-ended:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage and provide his thoughts. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a productive negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer, or if he's unresponsive, I can move on to John."
