Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but lower than what John is offering. This gives me some room to negotiate and still get a decent profit. I'm hoping Bob will counteroffer, allowing me to potentially get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal.  I'm going to reject and try to get a bit closer to my target by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,600,000. This is a compromise, moving a bit closer to Bob's offer but still leaving room for potential negotiation.  I'm hoping this will be more attractive to Bob, and we can finally close the deal."

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,550,000.  This is a more aggressive counter than before, but I think I can still get Bob to agree. It's close to my minimum and a decent profit for me. I'm hoping this will be the final offer and we can reach an agreement."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum and we've already gone through several rounds of negotiations. I don't want to risk getting stuck in a long back-and-forth and potentially losing a better opportunity with John.  It's time to move on and sell to John for $1,500,000."
