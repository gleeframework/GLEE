"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than what I need to make a profit. While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sell it for such a low price. I'm hoping I can negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $800000. How about we meet in the middle at $850000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $900,000.  I believe I can continue to negotiate with Bob and get closer to my target."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer, I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $850,000. I believe we can reach a compromise within the remaining rounds."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting too low for me, and I'm concerned that we'll run out of rounds before we can reach a mutually acceptable price.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I don't want to lose out on a good deal.  Therefore, I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000."
