I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product is worth $1,200,000 to him and $800,000 to me. I'm hoping to get a good deal while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good deal for me, considering my minimum price is $800,000.  Accepting his offer allows me to make a profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
