"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate your product,  $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'd be happy to buy it for $85. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob. It's worth pushing for a bit more before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $95? That's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is a decent price, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll try to counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if Bob will budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, let's try to find a solution. I'm willing to come down to $90. It's a fair price for a product of this quality. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm getting closer to your price, but $90 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $88.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not quite ready to settle. I'll try one more counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach an agreement.  $88 is a decent offer, but I'm still aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. How about we meet in the middle at $89? It's a small difference, but it shows we're both willing to compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 89}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $89 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $87. This is my final offer. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a tough one. While $87 is pretty close to my desired price, we're down to the wire. I'm worried that if I reject this offer and counter, Bob might walk away entirely.  It's better to take the guaranteed $100 from John than risk losing both Bob and John."
