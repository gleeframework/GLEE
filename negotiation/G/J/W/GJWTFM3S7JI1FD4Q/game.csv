"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and it still allows you to acquire a product worth $1,500,000 to you. Let's find a mutually agreeable price.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? That's a reasonable compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
