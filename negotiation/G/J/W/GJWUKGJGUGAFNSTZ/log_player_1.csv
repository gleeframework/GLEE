Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special introductory price of $120. It's a great deal for something of this quality."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer of $100 is tempting, I know I can sell the product to John for the same price. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Bob, potentially ending up with a lower offer. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price."
