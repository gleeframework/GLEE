"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get the product for a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",7000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $6,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $7,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",7200.0,Alice,5,
