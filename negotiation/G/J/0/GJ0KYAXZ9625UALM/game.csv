"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product,  $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.  Let's make this happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $850000, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to pay $825000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.  What do you say?",825000.0,Bob,4,
