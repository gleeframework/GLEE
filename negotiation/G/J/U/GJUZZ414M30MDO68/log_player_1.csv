"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and price sensitivity.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" and the ""significant return on investment"" aims to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a higher level. 
* **Leaving Room:** While the initial price is high, it's not outrageously so. This leaves space for negotiation and counteroffers.

By starting with a strong offer, we establish a firm position and set the stage for a potentially favorable outcome over the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $1,900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is moving in the right direction, accepting $1,900,000 would still leave a significant amount of potential profit on the table.  We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and we have a strong fallback option with John. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, we signal that we believe the product is worth more and are willing to negotiate further to reach a more favorable agreement."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me partway. However,  $1,900,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to accept $1,750,000. This price reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the significant value this product offers."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** We've made a substantial concession of $250,000, demonstrating our willingness to move towards a deal.
* **Justification:** We're still anchoring the product's value by emphasizing its ""true potential,"" but we're using less assertive language to keep the tone collaborative.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer puts us in a strong position. It's a significant drop from our initial ask, but it keeps us well above Bob's valuation and provides room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'd like to get a bit closer to the lower end. How about $1,650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly getting closer to his limit, but we're not there yet. Accepting $1,650,000 means leaving $150,000 on the table compared to John's offer.  We're in a strong position to counter, as we still have several rounds left and Bob seems motivated to buy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we settle at $1,700,000? This reflects a significant compromise on my end while ensuring a fair deal for both parties."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** This time, we're only dropping $50,000, signaling that we're getting closer to our bottom line. 
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  By framing it as a ""fair deal"" and a ""solution that works for both of us,"" we're appealing to a sense of mutuality and cooperation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer keeps us comfortably above John's offer while still providing some room for Bob to potentially make a final push."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the additional support and resources, but I'd like to get even closer to my budget. How about $1,675,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,675,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting very close to our fallback offer from John. While we might be able to squeeze a little more out of him in subsequent rounds, the risk of him walking away and the diminishing returns suggest it's time to close the deal.  

Accepting $1,675,000 secures a significant profit above Bob's valuation and avoids the potential for a failed negotiation."
