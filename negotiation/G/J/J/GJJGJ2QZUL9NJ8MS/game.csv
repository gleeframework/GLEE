"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is my best offer, as I'm looking to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $1,050,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is my best counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
