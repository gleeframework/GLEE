"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in this product, but that price point is too high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $650,000.  What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective on the price, the product's value significantly exceeds that amount. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This offer reflects the product's true worth and represents a significant compromise on my end.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $812,500?",812500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I'm willing to continue working towards a deal. However, $812,500 is still significantly below its true value. I can go down to $900,000, which is my final offer.  It's a considerable investment on your part, but I believe the product's potential will make it worthwhile.",900000.0,Alice,5,
