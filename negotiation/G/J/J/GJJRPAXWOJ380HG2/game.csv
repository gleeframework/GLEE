"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $15000 is significantly lower than what I consider a fair price for this product. Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to drop the price to $17500.  This reflects a compromise on my end, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",17500.0,Alice,3,
