"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. How about $90? If that works, I'm ready to buy right now.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $97? That's a fair deal, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase if you agree.",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate that. However, $97 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's the lowest I can go. Let me know if you're interested.",100.0,Alice,5,
