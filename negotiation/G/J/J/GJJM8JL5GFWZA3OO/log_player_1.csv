Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him incentive to negotiate, but still leaves room for you to make a profit.
* **It's below your minimum price:** This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **The message is friendly and encouraging:** This sets a positive tone for the negotiation.

Remember, the goal is to get as close to your minimum price ($150) as possible. If Bob rejects, be prepared to counteroffer or go to John if he doesn't meet your price expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That product looks great, but $125 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is far below my minimum price of $150.  While $80 is better than nothing, it's not worth losing $70. I will reject his offer and counteroffer to try and get closer to my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 102.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. How about $90? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my desired price than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum of $150. I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's still a great deal for you!  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 110}
