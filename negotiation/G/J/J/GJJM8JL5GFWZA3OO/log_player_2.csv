Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's still a great deal for you!  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

It's unlikely Alice will go below $100. It's better to secure the product at $100 from John than to risk further negotiation."
