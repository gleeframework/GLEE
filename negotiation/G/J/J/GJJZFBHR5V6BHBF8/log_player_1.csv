Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This offer allows you to gain a considerable return on your investment."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering it slightly below Bob's valuation ($1,400,000) maximizes your potential profit while still making it highly likely Bob will accept. 
* **Exclusivity:** Emphasizing the ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a sense of urgency and value.

This approach aims to secure a deal that's significantly better than your fallback option (John) while still being appealing enough for Bob to accept."
