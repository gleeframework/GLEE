"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth at least $10000 to you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a little.  Let's meet in the middle at $10500. This still leaves us both with a good margin, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10500 is still a bit too high.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $10250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",10250.0,Bob,4,
