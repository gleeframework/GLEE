Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I believe it will be valuable to you, and this is a competitive price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that you value your product. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** While you know Bob values the product at $120, aiming slightly higher gives you a chance to get a better deal. If Bob negotiates, you can always come down a bit. 
* **""Competitive Price""**:  This phrase is used to subtly anchor the price in Bob's mind, making him think it's a fair deal compared to other options.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be particularly price-sensitive, you might want to start with a slightly lower offer. 
* **Negotiation Skills:** This offer assumes you're comfortable with negotiation. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and have a strategy in mind for how you'll respond."
