"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget. You have room to negotiate and aim for a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10500 is a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my budget, but still above my maximum price. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is a fair price that's closer to my budget and hopefully reasonable for you. Let's try to find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10750 is still a bit below my minimum price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a fair deal considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, she's still above my maximum budget.  At this point, it's more advantageous to go with John's offer and secure the product at my desired price.  I've already made multiple counteroffers and it seems unlikely I'll be able to get Alice to go lower than $11,200."
