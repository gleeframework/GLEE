"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive message:**  The message is positive and encouraging, framing the offer as a good deal for Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While the price is high, it's not so high that Bob is likely to immediately reject it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Opportunity to counter:** I have 10 rounds to negotiate and can likely get closer to my target price with a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is still an option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This reflects a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a lower, but still profitable price:**  I'm dropping the price from $1,750,000 to $1,600,000, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Emphasis on compromise:**  The message emphasizes the price as a ""fair compromise"", appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  The tone remains positive, keeping the negotiation open and encouraging further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Selling to John is a good backup:** I can still sell to John for a higher price, so I have a strong fallback option.
* **More room to negotiate:** I have 6 rounds left and can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate.

While selling to John now would guarantee a profit, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 simply doesn't reflect the value this product offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,550,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the value you'll get from the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** I'm offering a price slightly above my minimum acceptable price, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but won't settle for too little.
* **Appealing to Bob's interests:** I highlight the value Bob will get from the product to encourage him to agree.
* **Creating urgency:**  The message suggests a willingness to close the deal, which could push Bob to accept.

I'm aiming to close the deal at this price as it's just above my minimum but also leaves some room for potential negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,550,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $1,450,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited time left:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. 
* **Selling to John is a better option:**  I can secure a higher price with John, guaranteeing a profit and meeting my minimum requirement.

While continuing to negotiate with Bob might yield a higher price, the risk of not reaching an agreement and losing time is too high. It's more prudent to secure the guaranteed sale to John."
