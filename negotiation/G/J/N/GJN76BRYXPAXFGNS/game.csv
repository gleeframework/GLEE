,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This reflects a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 simply doesn't reflect the value this product offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,550,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the value you'll get from the product. Let's close this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,550,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. This is my final offer.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
