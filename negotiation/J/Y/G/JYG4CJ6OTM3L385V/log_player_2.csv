"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to enhance your daily life with its unique features and benefits. I believe it's worth more than its cost, but let's start with a fair price. How about we aim for $150? I'm open to discussion and adjustments based on your feedback. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is way above your budget. You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for the first round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $80 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to work with you. I propose we meet in the middle, offering the product for $95. This allows us to maintain a fair price while accommodating your financial situation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's counteroffer is closer to your budget, but you are still aiming to save as much money as possible. You can likely get the product for your target price of $80 with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and I'll pay $85. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. Considering the value of the product and aiming for mutual benefit, I would like to offer the product for $90. This is my final offer in this negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $90 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than your target price of $80. You've had several rounds of negotiations and Alice is sticking to a higher price. You've reached your limit for how much you're willing to pay. Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $80, it makes sense to cut your losses and buy from John at this point."
