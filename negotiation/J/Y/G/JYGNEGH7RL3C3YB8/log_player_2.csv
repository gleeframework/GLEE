"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate.  Since you're willing to pay $12,000, Alice's first offer isn't a bad starting point, but it's worth seeing if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  A $2,000 drop is a substantial discount, and I'm hoping it will encourage Alice to come down from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has come down a bit, but I'm still hoping to save more. It's worth seeing if she'll go lower with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm increasing my offer by $500, showing I'm willing to compromise but still pushing for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to a price I'm comfortable with.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk she'll reject my next counteroffer and we might not reach an agreement. It's safer to accept her offer and secure the product at a good price."
