"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is significantly more than her value of $800,000. This means there's room for negotiation. 
* Buying from John for $1,500,000 is a worse deal than accepting Alice's offer.
* Rejecting the offer and counteroffering allows Bob to try and secure a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, I know the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This allows us both to benefit from this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price from $1,300,000 to $1,200,000. This is closer to Bob's counteroffer of $1,000,000, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* While Bob could try to counteroffer again, there's a risk that Alice could reject and then offer a higher price, or even end the negotiation.
* Accepting the offer at $1,200,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly less than John's price of $1,500,000 and allows Bob to acquire the product."
