"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000

The product is worth $15,000 to you, and Alice is offering it for $20,000.  It's better to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can always buy from John for $15,000 if the negotiation fails."

While $17,000 is closer to your target, it's still above your maximum. There's still room for negotiation, and you can try to get a lower price."

You are still $1000 over your budget. You can continue to negotiate with Alice, but there's a good chance she will not go lower, as the product is worth $15,000 to her.  At this point, it might be worth it to buy from John for $15,000 to avoid further negotiation."

You are offering your maximum budget for the product. This is the last offer you can make. If Alice rejects it, you will buy from John."
