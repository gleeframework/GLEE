"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000. This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,000,000 is a good starting point, we need to find a middle ground that reflects the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
