"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, but $8,000 is also a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price that should be more in line with what you're looking for.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer.  I appreciate you working with me.  While $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I still think it's a little steep. How about we settle at $9,500? I feel that's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to work together. However, $9,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",11000.0,Alice,5,
