Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the maximum I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is getting closer to the minimum we'd accept, we still have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. It's too early to settle for his current offer when we have more rounds and a guaranteed backup option with John."

Round 5

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firm on the value of this product. Let's settle this at $1,825,000.  This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,650,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is the maximum I can go without going over my budget.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting closer to our bottom line, but we're not there yet. We're still significantly above John's offer, so we have some room to push back and aim for a price closer to $1,700,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close to a deal that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and call it $1,750,000? This reflects my final offer."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the maximum I can go. Would you be willing to consider $1,700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has met us at a price we find acceptable. It's a significant profit above our minimum, and while there's a chance we could push for a bit more in the remaining rounds, it's not worth the risk of him lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling out. Accepting this offer secures a good deal now."
