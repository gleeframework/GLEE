"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, I believe this product holds significantly more value than that. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,900,000. I think this reflects a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the maximum I can go.",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firm on the value of this product. Let's settle this at $1,825,000.  This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,650,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is the maximum I can go without going over my budget.",1650000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close to a deal that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and call it $1,750,000? This reflects my final offer.",1750000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the maximum I can go. Would you be willing to consider $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Bob,8,
