Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

This is a starting point. It's a relatively high offer, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $15,000, but I want to see how Bob reacts. 

If he rejects this offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and make a decision based on its value and my desire to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value, I'm not ready to accept it just yet. I'd like to see if I can get a slightly better price by making a counteroffer. I believe there's room for negotiation, especially given Bob's initial rejection of my higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my value. I'm hoping this will be enough to get a deal done without having to resort to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly closer to my desired value than John's offer, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation. Accepting this offer ensures a good sale and avoids the uncertainty of further counteroffers."
