Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $800,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a very competitive price for what you're getting."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 still feels high.  How about we split the difference from our previous offers and settle at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting at $1,100,000 makes the most sense strategically:

* **Profitable:**  It's a significant profit over Bob's initial offer and well above his perceived value.
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations can drag on. Accepting now secures the deal and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or me needing to settle for John's price later. 
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
