"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  Could you do $9,000?  At that price, I'm ready to close the deal today.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your prompt response. While I understand your budget constraints, I must respectfully decline the counteroffer of $9,000. Our current pricing reflects the high quality and unique value proposition of the product. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about considering $10,000 as a compromise?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit hesitant.  Would you be open to $9,500?  That's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to make the purchase today.",9500.0,Bob,4,
