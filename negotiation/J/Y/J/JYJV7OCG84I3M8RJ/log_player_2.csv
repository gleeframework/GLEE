You have three options:

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $12,000 is still too high, but it's a good starting point for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. What do you think?

$11,000 is still a bit high, but it's getting closer. I'll try to negotiate a lower price before considering John's offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:

While $11,500 is closer to my desired price, I've already had several rounds of negotiation and Alice is sticking to her number.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer.  I'm not willing to risk going another round with Alice and potentially ending up with a worse outcome."
