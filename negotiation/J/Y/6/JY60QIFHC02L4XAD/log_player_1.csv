Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the value you've mentioned and my budget.

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,500,000 mark I need. Accepting his current offer would mean losing out on a significant sum. It's more profitable to cut negotiations short and sell to John, securing the guaranteed $1,500,000."
