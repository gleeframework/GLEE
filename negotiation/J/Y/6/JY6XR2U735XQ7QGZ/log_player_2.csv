Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value justifies a higher price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to compromise too much on the price. I'm willing to offer a slight adjustment and sell the product to you for $880,000. This is the closest I can get to your desired price while still ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000.

While we could continue negotiating, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $880,000 secures a significant discount from both her initial offer and John's price."
