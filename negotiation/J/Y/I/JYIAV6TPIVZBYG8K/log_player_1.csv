Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a good starting point because it's a significant discount for Bob, making it likely he'll consider the offer. At the same time, it's still a good price for me, well above my minimum acceptable value.  I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed, but I want to start strong."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $8,000. I'm willing to take a slight risk and negotiate further. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm countering with $9,000. This is a compromise that acknowledges Bob's desire for a lower price but still allows me to secure a profit. I believe it's a fair price considering both our positions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This negotiation has gone back and forth a few times, and Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, but still aren't quite there.  While I'm open to negotiating further, I'm also aware of the opportunity cost involved. John is a guaranteed sale at $8,000.  Given the risk that Bob may continue to haggle, I'm going to accept John's offer and move on."
