""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm asking for $1,190,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since John is guaranteed to buy the product for $1,200,000, Alice wants to see if she can get more from Bob. 
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** Offering the product for a price between Bob's value ($1,000,000) and John's guaranteed purchase price ($1,200,000) creates a potential win-win.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The price of $1,190,000 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate if he wants, while still securing a substantial profit for Alice."
