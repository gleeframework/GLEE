Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product which I know you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $14,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price of $10,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, who's willing to buy the product at your minimum acceptable price. This knowledge allows you to be more confident in aiming higher with Bob. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale."
