Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's closer to my ideal outcome but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Focusing on Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to make him see the benefit of buying at this price.
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the fairness of the deal, which can make Bob more receptive.

This strategy aims to get the negotiation started while keeping my options open. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is better than John's, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I'm not in a rush to sell, so I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can secure a higher price. 

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  $850,000 is a bit too low for me considering the value of the product to you. I'm willing to come down a bit more from my initial offer and propose $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a great deal. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $950,000 to $900,000. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm again highlighting the value of the product to Bob to justify the price.
* **Collaboration:** I'm emphasizing that I'm looking for a solution that works for both of us, hoping to build rapport and encourage a positive outcome. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while still maintaining a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $875,000. This shows good faith on my part, and I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I'd prefer to get closer to $900,000, I'm not sure if further negotiation will be fruitful. Bob seems firm on his offer.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, there's a chance he'll walk away, leaving me with only John's $800,000 offer. 

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic decision at this point. It secures a sale close to my minimum and minimizes the risk of losing a deal altogether."
