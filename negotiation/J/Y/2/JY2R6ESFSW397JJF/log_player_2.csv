"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get the product for a lower price than $950,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  $850,000 is a bit too low for me considering the value of the product to you. I'm willing to come down a bit more from my initial offer and propose $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a great deal. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price,  $900,000 is still too high for Bob.  He is aiming for a price closer to $850,000.  Rejecting the offer again allows him to continue the negotiation and hopefully secure a more favorable price."
