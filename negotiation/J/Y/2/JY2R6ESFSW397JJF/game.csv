"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  $850,000 is a bit too low for me considering the value of the product to you. I'm willing to come down a bit more from my initial offer and propose $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a great deal. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $875,000. This shows good faith on my part, and I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
