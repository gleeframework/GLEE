"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $85 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $95. This is a fair price considering the product's worth, and it's still more than what you initially offered. Let me know if you're interested.",95.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from the price I'm comfortable with. How about $87.50? I think that's a fair price for the product.",87.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not getting closer to a deal. While I appreciate your persistence, $87.50 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $92.50, but that's my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers. Let me know.",92.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to come down to $92.50, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $88.75? I think that's a fair price for the product.",88.75,Bob,8,
