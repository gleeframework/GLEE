Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm interested in selling to him, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction in price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1750000 is still a bit steep.  Let's split the difference and go with $1375000. This would be a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, Bob's offer is still too low. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're still a bit apart, but $1,375,000 is unfortunately not a price I can accept.  Let's try $1,625,000. This offer is more than halfway between our last two offers.  I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1625000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1625000 is still out of my reach. Let's try $1500000.  This is a significant reduction from your previous offer and I believe it's a fair price.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum price, and I'm happy to close the deal with him. This is a good outcome considering the back-and-forth negotiation."
