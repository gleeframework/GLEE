"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $2000000. This is a fair price considering its value and potential. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1000000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1750000? It's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1750000 is still a bit steep.  Let's split the difference and go with $1375000. This would be a good compromise for both of us.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're still a bit apart, but $1375000 is unfortunately not a price I can accept.  Let's try $1625000. This offer is more than halfway between our last two offers.  I believe it's a fair compromise.",1625000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1625000 is still out of my reach. Let's try $1500000.  This is a significant reduction from your previous offer and I believe it's a fair price.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this point.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
