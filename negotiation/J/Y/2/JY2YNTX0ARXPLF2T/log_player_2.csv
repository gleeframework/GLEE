Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1000000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1750000? It's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know your thoughts.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
