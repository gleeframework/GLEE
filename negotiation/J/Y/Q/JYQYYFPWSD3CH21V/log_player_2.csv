{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. How about $7,500? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,250? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at $8,000. I'm willing to meet you at $8,100, but no lower. It's a small premium, and I think it's worth it for the quality of the product.
