Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always a good idea to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for bargaining and gives the impression the product might be worth even more.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest. If he immediately accepts, I know I could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects, I can adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I have John as a backup buyer, guaranteeing me at least $100. This knowledge gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I want to explore if I can get a slightly better deal. I'll counter-offer with a price closer to my initial asking price to test his flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at $115?"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counter-offer shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still aims for a price above my minimum. 
* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):**  While not exactly splitting the difference between our previous offers, it's closer to his offer, signaling a willingness to make a deal.  
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm not dropping to $100 immediately, keeping some bargaining power. I can always accept his price in the next round if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I would like to propose $100 as the final price for the product. This brings us closer to my maximum spending limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $100, and it's unlikely he'll go higher. Since this matches my minimum acceptable price and I have a guaranteed buyer at this price (John), it's time to accept the offer.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether."
