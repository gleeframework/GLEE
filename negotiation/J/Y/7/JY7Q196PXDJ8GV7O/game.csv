"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value of this product for you.  Let's close this deal.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $925,000, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $925,000, so I'll offer $912,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can agree on a price.",912500.0,Bob,4,
