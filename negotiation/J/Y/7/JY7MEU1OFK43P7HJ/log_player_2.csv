Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that 90 is a bit high for you, but I'm still hoping to get a good price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at 87.50?

Bob is sticking to his strategy of inching closer to his target price. Offering $87 is a compromise that demonstrates his willingness to meet Alice halfway, while still aiming for a price closer to his desired value.
