Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $14,000 is higher than the $12,000 Bob is willing to pay, giving him some room to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum value:** $14,000 is still above your minimum of $15,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can still negotiate down to a price you're happy with, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above his stated value ($12,000), it's still significantly below my minimum value ($15,000).  Selling to John for $15,000 is the best option if Bob doesn't come closer to my target. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated fairly for the value of this product. How about $13,500? This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** $13,500 is halfway between my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($12,500).
* **Remaining profitable:** This price is still above my minimum value of $15,000, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Clear communication:** My message emphasizes the value of the product while acknowledging Bob's budget constraints."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to make a reasonable profit, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $13,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** While $13,000 is still below my minimum value of $15,000, it's very close. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I might be able to get a slightly higher price in the next round. However, I risk losing him as a buyer if I push too hard. 
* **Time consideration:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and relatively good deal.

Considering the above, I'll accept Bob's offer. It's a reasonable price, and I can always try to improve it in the future if I have the opportunity."
