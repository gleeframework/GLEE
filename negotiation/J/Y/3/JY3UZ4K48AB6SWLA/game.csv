"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to stay within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated fairly for the value of this product. How about $13,500? This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,3,
