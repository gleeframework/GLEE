"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. To start, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This reflects the product's value to me while remaining within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is thoughtful, the value of this product significantly exceeds that amount for its unique applications. I'm confident we can bridge this gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects a considerable compromise on my end while still recognizing the product's true worth.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 remains outside my budget.  I'm comfortable offering $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the product's potential value for me. I'm hopeful we can bridge the gap and reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I recognize your position and am willing to make another move.  Let's settle this at $1,050,000. This represents a significant price reduction on my end and is my final offer. It reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your efforts, $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a middle ground to make this deal work for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,6,
