Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. To start, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This reflects the product's value to me while remaining within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but he's unlikely to reach my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him not reaching my minimum or dragging the process out further."
