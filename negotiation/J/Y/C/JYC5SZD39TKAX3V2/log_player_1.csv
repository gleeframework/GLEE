Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $10,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider this lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Since Bob is unwilling to budge from his $8,000 offer, it's best to cut my losses.  I'll sell the product to John and avoid further negotiation."
