Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable for a price of $150. It's a great deal for something of this quality."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you can aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $150 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere above your minimum.
* **Gauge Interest:**  A higher initial offer helps you understand how much Bob might value the product. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have gone even higher. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you know about Bob (e.g., his negotiation style), you might adjust your offer."
