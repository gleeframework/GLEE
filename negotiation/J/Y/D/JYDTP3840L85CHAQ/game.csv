"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to do $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, appreciate your interest!  $85 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $92.50?  That's still a good deal for a product like this.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $92.50 is still a little more than I can comfortably spend at the moment.  How about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $91. This way we both get a good deal. What do you say?",91.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $91 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $89.50? This would allow both of us to close the deal with a fair price.",89.5,Bob,6,
