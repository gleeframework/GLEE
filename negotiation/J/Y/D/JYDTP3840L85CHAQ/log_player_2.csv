"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $100 is still more than Bob is willing to pay.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to do $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a low counteroffer, aiming to get as close to his maximum price of $80 as possible.  He's offering a price that's still significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but not so low that it's likely to be immediately rejected."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, appreciate your interest!  $85 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $92.50?  That's still a good deal for a product like this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $92.50 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum price. He's still hoping to negotiate a lower price and hasn't reached his limit yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $92.50 is still a little more than I can comfortably spend at the moment.  How about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, pushing for a price closer to his target. He's offering a price slightly higher than his previous offer, showing that he's willing to compromise while still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your position. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $91. This way we both get a good deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get the product for as close to $80 as possible. Even though Alice is getting closer to his maximum price, he's not ready to accept yet.  He has more rounds to negotiate and could potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $91 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $89.50? This would allow both of us to close the deal with a fair price."", ""product_price"": 89.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but he's also showing that he's willing to compromise. He's offering a price that's slightly higher than his previous offer, but still significantly lower than Alice's offer.  He's hoping that Alice will recognize that he's getting close to his maximum price and will be willing to accept his counteroffer."
