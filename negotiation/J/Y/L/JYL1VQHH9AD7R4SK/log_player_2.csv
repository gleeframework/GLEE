"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. This price is fair considering the product's value to you and my own needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. I think $10,000 is a bit too high for me, considering the product's value to me is around $8,000 to Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 8000}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer that is even lower than $8,000, since Alice's initial offer was $10,000 and my goal is to save as much money as possible.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your understanding of the product's value to me. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?"", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a great price for a product that's clearly worth much more to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer of $9,000 is still higher than I'd like to pay, but it's closer to the value I think the product has to her. I'd like to make another counteroffer, trying to get closer to my target price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 8500}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer, this time slightly higher than my previous one, to see if Alice is willing to meet me in the middle.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,000 and $9,000. Would you be willing to consider $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}"
