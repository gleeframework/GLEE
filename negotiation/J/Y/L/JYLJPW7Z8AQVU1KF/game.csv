"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $6,000 is significantly below its value. Could we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground. To be fair, I can't go as low as $7,500, but how about $9,500? This offer reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget.",9500.0,Alice,5,
