"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  $8500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $9000?  That seems fair, considering the value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $9000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go to $8750. It's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  $8750 is still a bit low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's settle on $8875.  I think that's a fair compromise, and we can both move forward.",8875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $8875 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8700. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product.  If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to go with John's offer.",8700.0,Bob,6,
