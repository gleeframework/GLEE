"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit steep at $850,000. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would be a fair compromise. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints,  $750,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value to me.  I'm willing to compromise, however, and offer it to you for $800,000. This price reflects the product's worth and provides a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to this offer.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I think this price is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $790,000. This price acknowledges the value of the product while staying within a reasonable range for both of us. Let me know if you're open to this final offer.",790000.0,Alice,5,
