Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the dynamics:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits you'll gain.  Let me know your thoughts â€“ this offer stands for the next 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. A significantly higher initial offer (in this case, $400,000 above Bob's value) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Time Limit:**  Adding a time limit creates a sense of urgency, potentially prompting Bob to act quickly.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""value and potential"" aims to justify the high price, even if Bob is aware of its worth to him. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:**  This strategy assumes you have some flexibility and that Bob might negotiate. If you know Bob is extremely price-sensitive or unlikely to engage in back-and-forth, a lower initial offer might be more effective.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a positive long-term relationship with Bob is crucial, a less aggressive starting price might be preferable.

This initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium.  You can then adjust your approach in subsequent negotiations if necessary, knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John."
