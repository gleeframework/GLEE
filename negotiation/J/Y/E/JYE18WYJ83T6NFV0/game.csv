"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $1,100,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1,200,000. This would still be a great deal for you, given the product's value. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,250,000? That's a fair price for both of us, I believe. Let's make this deal happen.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
