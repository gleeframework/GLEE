"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product,  $1,300,000 is above my budget. To make this work, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's agree on $1,150,000, and we have a deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows for profit for both of us.  I'm hopeful we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a compromise. How about we settle at $1,100,000? This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm still a bit over budget. To close this deal, I'm offering a final price of $1,075,000. This price reflects a fair value for both of us and allows us to finalize this transaction. I'm hoping we can agree on this final offer.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
