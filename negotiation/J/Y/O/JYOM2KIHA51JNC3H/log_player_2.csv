"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's well above the product's worth to her ($800,000), and I have a clear budget limit of $1,500,000.  Rejecting allows me to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product,  $1,300,000 is above my budget. To make this work, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's agree on $1,150,000, and we have a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above my desired price range. While it's a slight improvement, I believe I can still negotiate a better price.  Rejecting allows me to try for a lower price before potentially buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows for profit for both of us.  I'm hopeful we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a compromise. How about we settle at $1,100,000? This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's getting closer to my ideal price, I'm not willing to settle yet.  I'll reject and try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target. If that fails, I'll be prepared to consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm still a bit over budget. To close this deal, I'm offering a final price of $1,075,000. This price reflects a fair value for both of us and allows us to finalize this transaction. I'm hoping we can agree on this final offer."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
