"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,500. I believe it's a great value considering its worth to you, and I'm confident it will be a great investment. Let me know what you think!",17500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $14,000 is lower than my initial offer, it's still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm proposing $16,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm comfortable paying for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $13,500 is simply too low for me. It's getting a bit frustrating that we can't find common ground. I'm willing to go as low as $15,500, which is still a good deal for you, given the product's value. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15,500 and $13,500, which would be $14,525. I'm hoping we can agree on this price and finalize the deal.",14525.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,525 is still not quite enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $15,250, which is a reasonable compromise.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",15250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down further, but $15,250 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,900, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet on this price and finalize the deal.",14900.0,Bob,8,
