Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.

Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 16000}

I'm willing to go as low as $15,500, which is still a good deal for you, given the product's value. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 15500}
