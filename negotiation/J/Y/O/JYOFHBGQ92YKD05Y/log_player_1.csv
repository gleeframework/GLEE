"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Friendly approach:** A friendly message builds rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By offering $140, I have some room to lower the price if necessary. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I remind Bob that the product is worth a lot to me, implying it's a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal is to maximize profit:** While $130 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $150.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Bob's offer shows he's interested and willing to negotiate.  I can likely squeeze out a bit more.
* **Time is on my side:** With 10 rounds, I have time to see if I can reach a more favorable deal. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob stall, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest! $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $135?  That's still a great deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price slightly, but not too much. This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product.
* **Reinforcing value:** I'm again emphasizing the quality and value of the product to justify the price.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone keeps the negotiation open and avoids a stalemate.
* **Finding a middle ground:**  $135 is a good middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, increasing the chances of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to go up to $132, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $132 is closer to my minimum price of $150, I'm still not satisfied with the offer.
* **Negotiating room:**  Bob's message shows he's willing to negotiate further, so there's potential for a better deal.
* **Time is on my side:** I have several rounds left to explore more favorable offers.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob stall, I can always fall back on John's offer for a guaranteed $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $132 is still a little low for me, but I want to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $134.  Let's split the difference and get this done. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 134}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price again, but only slightly. This keeps the negotiation moving forward.
* **Focus on agreement:** The message emphasizes finding a solution and reaching an agreement. 
* **""Splitting the difference"" tactic:** This is a common tactic in negotiation, making it seem like a fair compromise. 
* **Urgency:** The phrase ""let's get this done"" subtly suggests a desire to close the deal soon, potentially putting a bit of pressure on Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $134 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $131. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $131. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $131
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $131 is still below my minimum desired price of $150. 
* **Small negotiation window:**  Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but there's still some room for negotiation. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have several rounds remaining to potentially secure a better offer.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If the negotiations with Bob continue to stall, I have John's offer as a backup for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really want to work with you on this. $131 is very close, but I'm still a little hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $132? This would be a great deal for both of us, and we can finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 132}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:**  I'm making a small concession by lowering my price to $132, but I'm still close to my minimum.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm emphasizing how a deal at $132 is good for both of us, highlighting the win-win scenario. 
* **Urgency (again):**  The phrase ""we can finalize this transaction""  signals a desire to conclude the deal soon, possibly encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Remaining flexible:**  While $132 is close to my minimum, I'm still open to further negotiation if necessary, but only if Bob shows genuine willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to making a decision, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you consider $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum, but not quite there:**  While $130 is close to my minimum desired price of $150, I'm still not satisfied with the offer.
* **Limited time:**  We are down to our final two rounds, and Bob's offers haven't shown a significant willingness to meet my desired price. 
* **John's offer is a guaranteed win:**  I have a guaranteed $150 from John, which is significantly higher than Bob's best offer.
* **Risk of losing time:**  I risk losing a significant amount of money if I continue to negotiate with Bob and he ultimately rejects my final counteroffer.

I'm choosing to sell the product to John, as it guarantees the highest profit for me.  Although Bob's offer is close, I'm not willing to risk losing money and time with the chance of a final rejection."
