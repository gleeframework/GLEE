"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique [product name] that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $200 is way above Bob's limit of $100. Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the [product name]. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $175? I'm confident this [product name] will be worth it for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $175 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $150.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
