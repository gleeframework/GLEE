"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's an exceptional opportunity that I believe could significantly benefit your business. Considering its value to you, I propose a price of $12,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** You're willing to pay a maximum of $10,000, and Alice is asking for $12,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds, and you're better off trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're highlighting, my budget for this product is $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price within that range."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In light of that, I would like to extend a special offer of $11,500 for the product. This price reflects a compromise that I hope will be acceptable to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While she has lowered her price, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000.
* **There's still room for negotiation:** You have 7 rounds remaining, and you're in a good position to continue negotiating.
* **Risk of losing out:**  If you accept this offer, you're losing $1,500.  It's worth trying to get closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is still beyond my budget.  I'm confident we can find common ground.  Let's try $10,500 â€“ a compromise that gets us both closer to our goals."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I appreciate your position and am prepared to meet you halfway. Therefore, I propose a final offer of $11,000 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise considering both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer, but not close enough:**  While she's reduced her price to $11,000, it's still higher than your maximum budget of $10,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** You only have 5 rounds left.  Continuing to negotiate might result in Alice's price going back up, or the negotiation might drag on without a resolution.
* **Guaranteed price:** By buying from John, you get the product for your desired price without any further negotiation. The risk of Alice increasing her price again or negotiation dragging on is eliminated."
