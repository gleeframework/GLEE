"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than her value of $800,000. There's definitely room for negotiation.  Since you have a backup option with John, it makes sense to try and get a better price from Alice before resorting to that."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,000,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to come down from her initial offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I want to pay. I can try to negotiate further and see if we can reach a price closer to my target. I'm not ready to buy from John yet, as there's still a chance to save money with Alice."
