"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,000,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? ",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, I believe.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
