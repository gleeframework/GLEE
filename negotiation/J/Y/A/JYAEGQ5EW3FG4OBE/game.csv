"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite willing to meet you at $120. I can offer you a slight discount, but I think a fair price for this product would be $160. Would you be willing to consider that?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Can you meet me at that price?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate that. However, $140 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $160, so I can offer you $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can offer $130 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm not willing to go as low as $130, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you $145, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $135, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",135.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made a few concessions already, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $145. I'm willing to hold firm at this price, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me at this point. If not, I may need to consider other options.",145.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're not willing to go any lower than $145, but I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'm willing to make a final offer of $80, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $80.",80.0,Bob,10,
