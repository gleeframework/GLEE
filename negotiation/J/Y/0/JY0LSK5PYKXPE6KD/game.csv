,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $75. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $75 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $82.50. What do you think?",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $82.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $78. Would you be willing to consider that?",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $78 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $80.50. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",80.5,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that you're serious about buying the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $81. What do you think?",81.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to make another concession. However, $81 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $79.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $79 and $80.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",79.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that you're serious about buying the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $79.75. This is my final offer. What do you think?",79.75,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making a final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make one more counteroffer of $79. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $79 and $79.75. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $80.",79.0,Bob,10,
