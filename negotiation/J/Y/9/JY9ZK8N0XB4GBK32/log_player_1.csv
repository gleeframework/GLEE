{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $105? It's a fair price that still gives you a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. Can you consider my offer?

While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied.  I'll try to negotiate a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but I'm still not comfortable going below $100.  Let's meet in the middle - I'll offer you the product for $102. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal."", ""product_price"": 102}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $102 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $98 for it. Can you consider my offer?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  Even though Bob's offer of $98 is close to my minimum, I've had five rounds of negotiation, and I'm not confident I can get a significantly higher price.  John's offer guarantees me $100, which is my floor, and I want to avoid the risk of further negotiation."
