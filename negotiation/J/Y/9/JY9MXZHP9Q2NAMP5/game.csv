"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,500,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, how about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,350,000 is closer to what I'm comfortable with, I still feel it's above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
