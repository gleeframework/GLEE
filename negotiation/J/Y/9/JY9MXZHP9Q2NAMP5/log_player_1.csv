Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,500,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$1,275,000 is a strong price, and it's not worth risking the deal by pushing further.  It's better to secure a good profit now than risk losing the sale entirely."
