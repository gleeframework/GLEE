"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. Given its unique nature and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 feels appropriate. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but her starting point is already close to that. 
* **Negotiation is key.** There's room to negotiate a lower price.  
* **John is a fallback option.** Having John as an option gives you leverage to be more aggressive in negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the potential of this product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,300,000? This would represent a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high.**  Her offer is still closer to her desired price than yours.
* **More room for negotiation.** You've already lowered the price considerably, and she's now willing to negotiate.
* **John is still a good backup.**  You have an alternative if you can't get a better price from Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's aim for a win-win.  How about we settle on $1,275,000?  This reflects the product's value while recognizing your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is very close to your counteroffer of $1,250,000. 
* **Win-win scenario:**  Accepting this offer means you get a good deal and save $225,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Risk of going further:**  Pushing for a lower price might risk losing the deal, especially with only 5 rounds remaining. 

While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential benefit of saving an additional $25,000."
