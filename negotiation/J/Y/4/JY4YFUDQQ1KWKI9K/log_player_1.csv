Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $120 is significantly higher than your minimum price of $80, meaning you'd still make a good profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $150, so there's room for him to counteroffer and reach a price that works for both of you.
* **It shows you're serious about a deal:** By offering a price, you show Bob you're not just fishing for a high offer.  

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $95 is still a bit below my initial desired price, it's a good compromise. It's significantly higher than what I'd get from John and ensures I make a decent profit. It's time to close the deal."
