"Alice, that's a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $11,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000.  However, I'm still just a little bit over my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 - that's a fair price considering the value to me and the savings you'd get over selling it to John.  What do you say?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I like that. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I can do a bit better than that. I can sell the product to you for $10,750. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to give you a bit more wiggle room. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm really close to my budget, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $10,250, but that's my absolute maximum.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to go with another seller. ",10250.0,Bob,6,
