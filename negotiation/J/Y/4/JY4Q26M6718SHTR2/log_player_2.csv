Bob should reject Alice's offer.  It's above his budget, and he can likely negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $11,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, he's still overpaying.  He should continue negotiating and see if he can get closer to his $10,000 goal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I like that. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I can do a bit better than that. I can sell the product to you for $10,750. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to give you a bit more wiggle room. What do you think?

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, he can still try to negotiate a bit lower.  He can make another counteroffer and see if he can get it down to his target of $10,000.  If Alice won't budge, he can then switch to buying from John."
