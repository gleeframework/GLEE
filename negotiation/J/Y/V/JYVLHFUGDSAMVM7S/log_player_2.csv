"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $15000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's too early to buy from John, as there's a chance to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8000 is below my minimum price, and I'm not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My new offer is $13000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'm getting from the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above your maximum budget of $8,000, but closer to your desired price.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to try to get a lower price with a counteroffer. You still have several rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll consider it.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $9500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My new offer is $14000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'm getting from the sale, and it's a significant compromise on my part as well. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still too high for Bob. Although she is making concessions, she is not moving close enough to Bob's budget.  The negotiation is starting to stall, and Bob has already made significant compromises.  At this point, it's more efficient and less risky to buy from John for $8,000 and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
