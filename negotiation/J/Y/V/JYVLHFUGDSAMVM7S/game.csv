"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $15000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8000 is below my minimum price, and I'm not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My new offer is $13000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'm getting from the sale.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to go up to $9500. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll consider it.  Let's find a way to make this work.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $9500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My new offer is $14000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'm getting from the sale, and it's a significant compromise on my part as well.",14000.0,Alice,5,
