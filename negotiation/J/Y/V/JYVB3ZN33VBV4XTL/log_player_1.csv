"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $120 is well above your minimum of $80, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's a good chance Bob will counteroffer, giving you room to negotiate up. 
* **It's not too high:** Offering $150 immediately might make Bob suspicious or unwilling to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll reject Bob's offer and counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
