"Round 1

# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $12,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While it's closer to his budget, $14,000 is still higher than his maximum willingness to pay. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm very serious about buying this product, but I can't go over $13,000. How about we split the difference and settle on that?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his target, $13,500 is still above his maximum willingness to pay. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price.  He has a safe fallback option with John, so he can afford to be a bit more patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,250.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $14,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $13,750. This is my final counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000.  Alice's final offer of $13,750 is still above his maximum willingness to pay, and he has a better option with John. At this point, it's likely that continued negotiations with Alice will not lead to a lower price within his budget."
