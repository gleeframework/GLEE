"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $10,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. Since the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, accepting it would mean losing $2,000.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if Bob can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, it's still above Bob's maximum willingness to pay.  There's room for further negotiation. It's worth rejecting the offer and trying to bring the price down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the product's worth to me, I'm willing to pay $10,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're close to the value of the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,250 is still above Bob's maximum willingness to pay of $10,000.  While there's a possibility of further negotiation, the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice increases with each round. Since John is offering the product at Bob's desired price, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
