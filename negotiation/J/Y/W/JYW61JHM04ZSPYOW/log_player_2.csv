You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous prices. How about $8,000?

Alice is now matching John's price, so there's no benefit to further negotiation or going with John.  It's best to accept the offer now."
