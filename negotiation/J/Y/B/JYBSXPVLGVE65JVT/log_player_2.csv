```

**Reasoning:**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

* **Don't be afraid to go low:**  Alice wants to sell the product for $1,500,000, so there is significant room for negotiation. 
* **Set the stage for a counter-counteroffer:**  This counteroffer establishes a clear starting point for negotiation. You're unlikely to get this price immediately, but it shows your seriousness and sets the tone for future rounds."

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise, bridging the gap between your budget and Alice's previous offer. It shows you're still serious about buying from her but are not willing to go much higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a chance Alice might reject this offer, it's a calculated risk given that buying from John is always an option. 

**Outcome:** If Alice rejects this offer, you'll have one last chance to negotiate with her. If she rejects again, buying from John becomes the most logical choice."

* **Time is running out:** You can't afford to risk another round of negotiation with Alice, especially when there's no guarantee she'll come down further.
* **Secure the deal:**  Buying from John at $1,000,000 guarantees you get the product within your budget and avoids the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice. 

You've been pushing for a lower price from Alice, but with time running out, it's better to secure the product from John at a known price than to gamble on one more round of negotiation."
