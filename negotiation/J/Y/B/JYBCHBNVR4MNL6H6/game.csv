"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1100000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm very interested in the product and I'm willing to pay $850000.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad you see its value. However, $850000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $950000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and gives you a great deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $900000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us.  It's a significant amount, and I believe it reflects the product's value.  I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about purchasing the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $980000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price that reflects the product's value and your interest in it.",980000.0,Alice,5,
