Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1100000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm very interested in the product and I'm willing to pay $850000.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.
