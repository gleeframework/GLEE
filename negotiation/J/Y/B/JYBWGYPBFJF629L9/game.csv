"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $105? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $100? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",100.0,Alice,5,
