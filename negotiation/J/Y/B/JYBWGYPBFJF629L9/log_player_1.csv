{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $115. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer aims to strike a balance. It's a bit below my minimum acceptable price of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm also prepared to counter if he makes a lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject it and counteroffer. I need to earn at least $120, and I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I'm not going to sell it for $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $105? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking $95 would be a more comfortable price for me. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer, hoping to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $100? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 100}
