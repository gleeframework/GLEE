"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I believe this price reflects its true worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $2000000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for it. This is the highest I'm comfortable going at this time. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a significant reduction from the original price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1750000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1750000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $1250000. This is a serious offer, and I truly believe it's a fair price for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find common ground, Bob, but $1250000 is still below the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1600000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.
