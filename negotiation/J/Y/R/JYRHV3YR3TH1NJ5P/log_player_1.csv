"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that might interest you. I'm asking $90 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $80. I'll try to counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is a bit too low for me. How about $85? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $78 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $78 is close to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell below $80. I'll see if I can get Bob to go just a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $80? That's my bottom line, and I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}
