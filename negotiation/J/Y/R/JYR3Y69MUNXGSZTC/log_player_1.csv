Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you are subtly reminding Bob that it's worth a significant amount, potentially more than even his valuation.
* **Time Pressure:**  By stating you'll list it publicly, you introduce a subtle time pressure, potentially motivating Bob to decide quickly.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains conversational (""What do you think?"") indicating a willingness to negotiate, which is crucial in reaching a mutually agreeable price. 

While we start at $15,000, be prepared to potentially negotiate down if Bob shows resistance. Remember, the goal is to maximize profit, but securing a sale is better than no sale at all if Bob is unwilling to budge significantly."
