Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject the offer.  $9,000 is still higher than his target of $8,000. There are still rounds left to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. How about $8,750?  That's closer to my budget, and I think it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,750 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering the product for $8,875.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Even though Alice's offer is getting closer to his target, he's already had a few rounds of negotiation and it's likely Alice won't go lower.  John's offer is guaranteed and within Bob's budget."
