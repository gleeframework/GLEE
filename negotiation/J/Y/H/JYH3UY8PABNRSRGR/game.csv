"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1000000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer hard to beat.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get out of it.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you think the product is pricey, but I believe it's worth more than $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value you'll get from the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1050000. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1050000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to discuss further.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
