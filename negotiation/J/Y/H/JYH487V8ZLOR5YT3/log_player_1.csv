Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit of $200,000 ($1,200,000 - $1,000,000) to be made.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to capture as much of that potential profit as possible, but not so high that Bob walks away. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message positions the product as valuable and exclusive.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 leaves you with a significant profit margin ($150,000 above your minimum) while still offering Bob a $50,000 discount on his perceived value. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator or price-sensitive, you might consider starting slightly lower (e.g., $1,125,000) to give yourself more room to negotiate.
* **Relationship Value:** If maintaining a strong relationship with Bob is important, you might be willing to accept a slightly lower price for the long-term benefit.

**Remember:**  This is just an initial offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and have a negotiation strategy in place."
