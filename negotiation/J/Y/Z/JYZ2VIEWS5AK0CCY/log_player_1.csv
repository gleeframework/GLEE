"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal, considering its worth to you. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than the product's worth to Bob, hoping to maximize my profit. This is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation but also showing that I'm confident in the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject it for now.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can come to an agreement closer to $850,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial asking price. How about $825,000?  This is a fair compromise, and allows both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $825,000, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $775,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to settle for less than $800,000 yet. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob, and I don't want to sell to John for less than what I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer. Let's split the difference between my last offer and yours. I'm willing to accept $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $800,000, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can we make a deal at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get closer to $800,000. There are still a few rounds left, and I'm confident I can secure a better price. I'm not willing to sell to John for less than $800,000, so I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $800,000.  How about we meet halfway between our last offers at $797,500?  This is a small increase, and it shows my commitment to making this deal work."", ""product_price"": 797500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $797,500. I'm willing to go up to $795,000, but no further. I think that's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. Can we finalize the deal at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm realizing that I'm unlikely to get closer to my desired price of $800,000 with Bob.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John, who is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price."
