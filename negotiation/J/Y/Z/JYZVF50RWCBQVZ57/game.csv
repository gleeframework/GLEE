"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad we're having a conversation. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle from my original offer, rather than from your initial counteroffer.

I'm confident the product's value is worth more than that, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,
