"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While $95 is under your $100 budget, you can likely get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. This will lead you to buy from John for $100, but you'll likely have an opportunity to negotiate with him for a lower price."
