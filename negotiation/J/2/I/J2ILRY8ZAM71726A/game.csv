"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to your business. It has the potential to significantly increase your profits.  I'm confident it's worth at least $1500000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1200000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. Please consider my offer carefully, as it's unlikely I'll be able to offer this price to anyone else.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
