"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but Alice is asking for $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate.** This gives you time to try and get a better price.
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** If you can't get a better price from Alice, you can always buy from John. However, it's better to try and save money if possible. 

**Next Steps:**  You should counteroffer Alice with a price that is closer to your desired price point, but still leaves some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.
* **Leaving room:**  Offering $900,000 still leaves a $100,000 gap, allowing Alice to feel like she's getting a good deal while also giving you a chance to save money. 
* **Strategic move:** This counteroffer shows you're serious about getting a better price but you're not willing to go too low in the early stages."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:**  Alice has moved closer to your price point. The offer is now only $50,000 above your counteroffer.
* **Time is a factor:** While further negotiation is possible, you only have 7 rounds left.  
* **Reasonable compromise:**  Accepting this offer allows you to buy the product for a price that is significantly lower than John's offer.

**Next Steps:** You've successfully negotiated a reasonable price, saving a significant amount compared to John's offer.  You can now focus on finalizing the purchase."
