Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $12,000.  Offering it at $10,000 gives Alice a significant profit margin ($2,000 above her minimum) while still being attractive to Bob (a $2,000 savings).
* **First-mover Advantage:** By offering it to Bob first, Alice creates a sense of exclusivity and urgency. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $10,000 is a strong starting point, there's a slight chance Bob might negotiate for a lower price. This leaves Alice some buffer while ensuring she stays well above her minimum selling point to John."
