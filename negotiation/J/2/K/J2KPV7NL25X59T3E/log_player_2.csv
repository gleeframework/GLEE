"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. It's a valuable item and I believe it's a fair price.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Since your maximum budget is $15,000, and Alice is offering the product at $15,000, there's no immediate benefit to accepting. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $13000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Alice has come down to $13,000, which is within your budget and a good deal.  It's worth accepting this offer and avoiding further negotiation."
