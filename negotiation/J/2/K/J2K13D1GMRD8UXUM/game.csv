"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. Can you meet me at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my original asking price. How about $9,500?  That would still be a great price for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from your original price. However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
