"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $640,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $640,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to her ($640,000 vs. $800,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can initiate a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $700,000 is a significant step up from Alice's initial offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. It demonstrates Bob's willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to his desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $680,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $680,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has increased her offer, it's still significantly lower than Bob's target price. He's willing to pay up to $800,000, and Alice is selling it for $800,000, so there's still room for negotiation. Bob should continue negotiating with Alice to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 720000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, showing Alice that he is serious about buying the product. $720,000 is a reasonable compromise, and it's likely Alice will find it more appealing than the previous offer. This strategy aims to gradually close the gap between Bob's desired price and Alice's perceived value, leading to a potential agreement in the coming rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $700,000 is now very close to Bob's target price.  He has already rejected a counteroffer at this price in Round 2. There is a good chance that continuing to negotiate will only drive the price up, potentially exceeding Bob's maximum budget.  It's wiser to accept this offer and secure the product at a price close to his desired range."
