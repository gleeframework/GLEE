"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay up to $8000 for it. Would that be acceptable?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest!  $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $14000? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not able to meet at $14000. Could you consider $10000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10000 just isn't going to work for me.  How about we split the difference at $11000? This gives you a great deal on a fantastic product, and it allows me to achieve my minimum goal.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I see where you're coming from, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $10500 for the product. Is this within your range?",10500.0,Bob,6,
