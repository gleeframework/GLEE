"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. It's a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'd like to negotiate further to meet in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $10,500?  That gives us both room to compromise and allows me to make a worthwhile sale.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
