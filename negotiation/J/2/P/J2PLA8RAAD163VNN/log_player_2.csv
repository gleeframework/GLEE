"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits us both.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that still allows you to profit and is within my price range. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $850,000. This price reflects the product's value and still allows you to make a reasonable profit. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
