"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $1500000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its value.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. This is my best offer."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $800000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find some common ground. I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique value.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget, even after coming down from her initial offer. Bob should continue to negotiate for a lower price.  He has already shown that he's willing to pay $800,000, so there's a good chance he can get closer to that number with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  It's a fair price and allows both of us to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
