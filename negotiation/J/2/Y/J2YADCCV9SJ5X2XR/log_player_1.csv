``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I want to start high to maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more reasonable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $15,000. This is still a good profit for me, but it's more in line with what I think Bob might be willing to pay. I'm hoping this will be more appealing than his $8,000 offer, and we can finally come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

Bob's counteroffer is still too low, and I'm not willing to continue negotiating. John is offering me a fair price, and I'm going to take it."
