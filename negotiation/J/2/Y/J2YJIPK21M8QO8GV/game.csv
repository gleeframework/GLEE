"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $14000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12500 for it.  This would give you a good profit while still being within my price range.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $13500 is a step in the right direction, I'm still unable to go that high.  Let's meet in the middle at $13000. This price would be fair to both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
