"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $1,000,000 is still above his maximum price point of $800,000.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2

```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still only able to offer $900,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the highest I can go.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and understand your budget constraints. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $925,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from it.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $925,000 is closer to Bob's budget, he should still try to negotiate a lower price. He is only $25,000 away from his maximum budget, and there are still several rounds left.  By rejecting the offer, he can try to get a more favorable price."

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're close. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $917,500 for the product. This feels fair to us both, and I'm confident it will be a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $917,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $917,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already gone above his maximum budget with Alice's offer of $917,500. He has a reliable alternative with John who is offering the product for $800,000.  With only a few rounds left, the potential for further negotiation is limited.  Bob should buy the product from John and save the money."
