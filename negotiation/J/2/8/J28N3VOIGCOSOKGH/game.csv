"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This offer reflects a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This price still reflects the product's worth to me, but I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  I hope you can reconsider.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
