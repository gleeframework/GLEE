"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you.  I'm confident it's worth at least $1 million to someone like yourself.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000.  This is a great opportunity to secure a product that will provide substantial returns.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $900,000
* **Your maximum willingness to pay:** $1,000,000
* **John's price:** $1,000,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially negotiate further with Alice, it's not clear if she's willing to lower the price.  Therefore, accepting her offer is the most financially advantageous option."
