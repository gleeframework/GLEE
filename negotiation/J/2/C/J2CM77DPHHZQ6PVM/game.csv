"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it incredibly valuable.  Let me know your thoughts!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a more reasonable starting point. How about we bring it down significantly, say to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $700,000 is far too low for me, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,250,000. This price still allows me to make a fair profit, and it's a good starting point for further negotiations.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  Let's try this - how about $850,000? It's a substantial increase from my previous offer and moves us closer to a realistic price.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still significantly below the product's true value.  Let's aim for a more realistic figure that acknowledges both our needs. How about $1,100,000?  This price is closer to my initial offer and reflects the substantial benefits this product offers.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but we still have some ground to cover.  I'm willing to stretch my budget further, but I need you to meet me closer to my range. How about $925,000? This offer represents a significant compromise on my part and demonstrates my strong interest in acquiring the product.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $925,000 is getting closer, but we're still not there yet. Let's meet in the middle at $1,012,500. It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to make progress. What do you think?",1012500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, we need to be realistic about where our prices are at. I'm willing to offer a final price of $950,000. This is a very strong offer considering my alternative option. Let me know if this works for you.",950000.0,Bob,8,
