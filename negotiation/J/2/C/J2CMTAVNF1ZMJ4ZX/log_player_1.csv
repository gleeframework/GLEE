Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** The product is only worth $8,000 to Bob.
* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice needs to make at least $12,000.
* **John's Offer:**  Alice has a guaranteed offer of $12,000 from John.

**Strategy:**

Alice needs to offer a price that's enticing to Bob but still significantly above his perceived value.  By starting high at $11,500, Alice leaves room for negotiation. Even if Bob negotiates down, Alice has a good chance of securing a price higher than John's $12,000 offer."
