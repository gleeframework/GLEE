"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value for someone like you. I'm initially offering it at $1,800,000.  This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way too high for me. I'm interested, but it needs to be significantly lower to make sense. How about $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below what I can consider. To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price, but $1,400,000 is still too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair offer, and I hope we can make a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about this - to show I'm serious about reaching a deal, I'll come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
