"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $12,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $16,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $14,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $15,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",15500.0,Alice,5,
