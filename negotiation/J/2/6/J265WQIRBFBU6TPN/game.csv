"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm. However,  $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $105 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $100?  I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to meet you at $102.50. It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",102.5,Alice,5,
