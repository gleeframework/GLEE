"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,400,000. It's a steal at this price, considering its true value to you. Let's make this a win-win situation! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000. This still leaves you a significant profit and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,300,000. This still leaves you with a great value and gives me a fair price for my product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,250,000. This would give us both a good deal and allow us to close this transaction quickly. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000? This would ensure a smooth and mutually beneficial transaction.  I'm confident that this price will be satisfactory for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price.** The offer of $1,275,000 is only $25,000 higher than Bob's last counteroffer.
* **Time is a factor.**  Bob has limited rounds to negotiate, and accepting this offer ensures a purchase within the time limit.
* **John's offer is a fallback option.** If Bob rejects this offer, he still has the option to purchase from John, but that will cost him more.

By accepting the offer, Bob secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of losing out to John."
