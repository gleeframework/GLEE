"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth at least $8000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. While $7500 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8500? This would still allow me to make a decent profit and I think it's a fair compromise.
