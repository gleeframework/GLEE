{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's gotten the price down to $8,200, which is within his budget and a good deal compared to buying from John.  While there's always the chance he could get a slightly lower price by continuing to negotiate, it's risky to continue.  He's already made good progress, and there's no guarantee Alice will continue to budge.  It's better to secure the deal now."
