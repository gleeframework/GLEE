"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $10,500. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a compromise to make this sale happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,500 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $12,000. There's a good chance you can get Alice to lower her price further, bringing you closer to your goal of saving as much money as possible."
