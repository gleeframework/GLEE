,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $12,000 is just too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $16,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $16,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. I really think it's a great deal for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're really keen on this product, and I appreciate that.  However, $13,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is just a little more than my absolute minimum.  If you're serious about this deal, let's close it now.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you're offering.",14500.0,Bob,6,
