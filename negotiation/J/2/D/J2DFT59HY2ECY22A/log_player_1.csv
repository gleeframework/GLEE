{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it'd be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more. It's also close to the midpoint between my minimum and Bob's perceived value, which could make him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to try to negotiate a bit higher. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price, especially since Bob clearly values the product at $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. That's a fair price, considering the product's value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my budget. I would like to propose $87 as the price for the product. It's a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would like to get closer to $90, Bob's offer of $87 is a good compromise.  It's significantly higher than what John would offer, and it's within my minimum acceptable price range. Accepting his offer ensures I make a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
