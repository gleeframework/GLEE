"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer. It's also important to see if Alice is willing to come down further in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  Offering $1,200,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price and leaves room for negotiation. This counteroffer signals Bob's serious intent to purchase but also demonstrates his willingness to walk away if Alice is unwilling to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still too high.  Bob wants to get the best deal possible and knows he has several rounds left to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise. He believes that $1,250,000 is a fair price, considering Alice's minimum acceptable price is likely around $1,000,000. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but still desires a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has come down significantly in price. While Bob could continue to try and get a lower price, the risk is that Alice will either walk away or become less flexible.  Accepting the offer at $1,280,000 is a good compromise, saving Bob a significant amount compared to John's offer and getting him the product at a price that is likely within Alice's acceptable range."
