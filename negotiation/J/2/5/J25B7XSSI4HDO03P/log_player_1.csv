Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need at least $12,000, so I can't go below that.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $10,000, so I can't go above that.
* **The middle ground:** $11,500 is a reasonable starting point. It's closer to my minimum, but still leaves some room for negotiation if Bob isn't happy with the offer.
* **Plan B:** I have John as a backup buyer, so I don't need to be too desperate to sell to Bob. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
