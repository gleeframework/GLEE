"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the conversation at $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects the true value and potential of what's being offered.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer. That price is a bit too high for me at the moment. I'm thinking something closer to  $600,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is significantly below the product's market value and potential. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a very competitive price for something of this quality and potential return on investment.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value this product brings, but $2,000,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Perhaps we can settle somewhere closer to the middle? How about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're finding some common ground. While $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't let it go for less than $1,750,000. This offer reflects the significant value this product will bring to your operations, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but that's still a significant jump from my last offer.  To be frank, I need to stay under $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to meet me somewhere near that mark?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
