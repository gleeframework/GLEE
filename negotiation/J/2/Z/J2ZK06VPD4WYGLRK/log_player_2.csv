"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $900,000 is closer to your maximum budget of $1,000,000 than to Alice's valuation of $800,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **More information needed:**  Rejecting the offer allows you to gather more information about Alice's willingness to negotiate. 
* **Exploring other options:**  While buying from John is always an option, you should first try to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, showing your serious intent to negotiate.
* **Meeting in the middle:** It also sits closer to Alice's valuation of $800,000 than your maximum budget of $1,000,000, suggesting a potential compromise.
* **Testing the waters:** This offer will give you a clearer picture of Alice's flexibility and potential for a deal within your desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant progress:** Alice's offer is now much closer to your target price range, and considerably lower than her initial offer.
* **Potential for more negotiation:** While you could continue negotiating, there's a good chance Alice won't go lower. 
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  Accepting this offer allows you to buy the product at a good price, reducing the risk of going through more rounds and potentially ending up with a higher price or having to buy from John at $1,000,000."
