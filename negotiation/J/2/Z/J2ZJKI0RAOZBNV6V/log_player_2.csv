"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss the details. Otherwise, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is a significant savings compared to John's price of $1,200,000. Even though Alice is bluffing about selling it for less, you still save a considerable amount by accepting her current offer."
