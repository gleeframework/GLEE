"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and gives me room to negotiate.  It's also important to remember that John is willing to pay my minimum, so I have a safety net if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for it yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm countering with $1,800,000. This is still a good amount of profit for me, and it's closer to my initial offer.  I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $1,400,000. While I am getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach an agreement.  John is still an option, but I think I can get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm countering with $1,600,000.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and brings me closer to Bob's last offer. With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to start closing the gap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm running out of rounds, I'm not willing to settle for that low of an amount. I will counteroffer again and try to bridge the gap.  If Bob rejects again, I'm very likely to sell to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm countering with $1,400,000. This is a compromise on my end, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  This is likely my final offer before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left and Bob's offer significantly below my minimum, I'm going to sell to John.  I'm not comfortable risking further negotiation and getting an even lower offer.  It's time to cut my losses and secure a sale that meets my minimum acceptable price."
