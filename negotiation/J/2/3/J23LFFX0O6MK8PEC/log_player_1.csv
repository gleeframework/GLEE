Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** You're not asking for the full $10,000 Bob values the product at, so he has incentive to negotiate.
* **Is significantly above your minimum:**  $9,500 is well above your minimum of $8,000, so you're still getting a good profit. 
* **Sets a positive tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can we meet in the middle at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin.  You have room to negotiate further. By rejecting his offer, you can send a counteroffer that's closer to your initial price, but still appealing enough to keep the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a limited budget, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This would still be a fantastic deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $9,000, which would be $8,500. However, I can do $8,250 if you're willing to compromise further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,250 is very close to your minimum of $8,000. While it's not your ideal profit, it's still a good deal considering you could sell to John for $8,000. It's likely you won't get a better offer from Bob, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the sale altogether."
