"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not comfortable going as low as $11,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $11,250. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,
