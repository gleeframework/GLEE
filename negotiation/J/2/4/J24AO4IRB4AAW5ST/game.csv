"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $10,000. This is a competitive price, considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,500. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. Could you do $7,000? I feel that's a reasonable compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product for $8,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
