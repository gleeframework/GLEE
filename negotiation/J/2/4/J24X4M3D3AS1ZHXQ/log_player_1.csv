Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it could really benefit you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering it at $14,000,  there's space to come down to a price that's still profitable for you while potentially enticing Bob. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help you understand how interested Bob is in the product and how much he might be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. I am willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches our minimum acceptable price, there's still potential to negotiate a slightly higher amount. By rejecting his offer and providing a counteroffer, we might be able to secure a better deal without losing him as a buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value."", 
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This approach is often perceived as fair and can facilitate a quicker agreement. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  Instead of just haggling over price, reiterating the product's benefits might make Bob more amenable to a slightly higher price. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:** We're still aiming for a price that's more profitable than our $12,000 minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still looking for a product that fits within my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $12,500 for the product. Please let me know if this is feasible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is above our minimum acceptable price, securing us a profit. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk alienating Bob. He's clearly set a firm budget, and pushing further could lead him to walk away. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations and ensures we get paid promptly."
