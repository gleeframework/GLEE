"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested, $14,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  Alice is offering the product for $13,000, which is within Bob's budget of $15,000 and a significant saving compared to buying from John.
* **Negotiation:** Bob has already negotiated the price down from Alice's initial offer of $14,000. 
* **Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Alice walking away or Bob needing to buy from John at a higher price. 

At this point, accepting the offer is the most logical choice to secure the product at a good price within Bob's budget."
