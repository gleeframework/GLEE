"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $875,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. Let's split the difference and go with $887,500.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal. ",887500.0,Alice,5,
