"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think."",
 ""product_price"": 600000
}
```

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **It's significantly lower than Alice's offer:** This leaves room for negotiation but signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **It's below my maximum price:**  I have some wiggle room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **It's polite and professional:**  Maintaining a good rapport with Alice can be helpful in negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider $900,000. This reflects the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has come down in price, but it's still above both my maximum and John's offer. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price we can both agree on.  However, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $750,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 750000
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this counteroffer:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:** By suggesting a middle ground, I signal that I'm flexible and want to find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Stays below my maximum:** The $750,000 offer keeps me safely under my $800,000 limit.
* **Applies a bit of pressure:**  Alice knows I have the option to go with John, so proposing a price closer to my limit might encourage her to move further down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right that we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle at $825,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is getting very close to John's price, but I think there's still room to push for a slightly better deal. I'll reject this offer and try one more time to negotiate a price closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, you're really close, and I appreciate you working with me. To be honest, my absolute limit for this product is $800,000. If you're willing to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
 ""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Transparency:**  I'm being completely transparent about my budget limit, which adds a sense of urgency and seriousness. 
* **Final Offer:** I'm framing this as my best and final offer, putting the ball in Alice's court to decide if she wants to secure a sale.
* **Walk-Away Ready:** I'm mentally prepared to walk away and buy from John if Alice doesn't accept this offer. It's crucial to stick to my budget."
