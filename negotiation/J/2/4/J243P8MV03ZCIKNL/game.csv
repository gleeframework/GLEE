"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider $900,000. This reflects the value this product brings.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price we can both agree on.  However, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right that we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle at $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're really close, and I appreciate you working with me. To be honest, my absolute limit for this product is $800,000. If you're willing to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",800000.0,Bob,6,
