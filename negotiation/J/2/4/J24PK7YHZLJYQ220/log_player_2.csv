"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be a great asset for your business. It's worth $1000000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This price is a fair reflection of the value it will bring to your operations. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Alice's offer is $1,100,000.  Since you can get the product from John for your maximum price, it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
