Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be a great asset for your business. It's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This price is a fair reflection of the value it will bring to your operations. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,100,000 is a compromise between your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. It gives Bob a potential $100,000 saving, while still ensuring you get a decent profit.
* **Message:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product to Bob and frames the price as fair and reasonable. It also invites further discussion, showing you are open to negotiation. 

**Why this strategy is good:**

* **Higher Profit than John:**  While you are offering a lower price than what John is willing to pay, you are still earning more than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  The message leaves room for negotiation, potentially increasing the final price.
* **Strong Incentive for Bob:**  The $100,000 potential saving could be enough to incentivize Bob to accept the offer."
