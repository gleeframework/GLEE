{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get even closer to my desired price, we're nearing the end of our rounds, and it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers.  $1,530,000 is still a good profit, and it's better than risking selling to John for less."
