"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm on a tight budget, and I'm not sure I can stretch to $115. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $105?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit, but I need to get at least $100 for this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $102.50?  That's a fair price for both of us.",102.5,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $95. Can you meet me at that price?",95.0,Bob,4,
