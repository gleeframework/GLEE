"Bob, I understand your desire to work within a budget.  I've given this offer careful consideration, and to be completely frank, the value this product brings to your specific situation is substantial. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't accept such a significant drop.  How about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my current financial situation, I am unable to meet at $1,225,000.
