"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-end product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within a budget of $8000, but I have to consider the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10000. Is this a more comfortable price for you?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $9000 for the product. Can you consider that price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $9500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value this product brings.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product, and that's my final offer. I'm not sure if I can go any lower than that.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on $9000, but I'm still not getting to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $9700. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",9700.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to reach your minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $9700. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $9700, which is $9350. I'm not willing to go any higher than that.",9350.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not getting to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get as close as possible to my target. I'm counteroffering at $9500. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to consider other options.",9500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand you're making one last concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $9500. I'm willing to pay $9200 for the product, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000.",9200.0,Bob,10,
