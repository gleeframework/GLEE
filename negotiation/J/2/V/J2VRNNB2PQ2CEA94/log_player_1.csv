Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping he'll be willing to pay a little extra. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I'll also keep John in mind as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay $75 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. However, I can't go below $80 for this product. It's a fair price given its value. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $85?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $85, which is halfway between my minimum price and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still trying to get a price closer to what the product is worth to me."
