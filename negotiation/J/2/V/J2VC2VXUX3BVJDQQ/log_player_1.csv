{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset that I know you're interested in. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This is my initial offer. I'm starting with a high price, but still within a range that Bob might be willing to pay. I'm hoping to start the negotiation off strong and see where it goes from there.  Remember, I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to a more mutually beneficial agreement. How about we set the product price at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still gives you a significant savings compared to what you'd pay elsewhere, and it allows me to get a fair price for my product. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my original proposal. I am willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the item. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get even more, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting his offer at $1,050,000 is a good compromise, and I'll make a profit."
