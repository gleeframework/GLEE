"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to a more mutually beneficial agreement. How about we set the product price at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still gives you a significant savings compared to what you'd pay elsewhere, and it allows me to get a fair price for my product. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my original proposal. I am willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the item.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
