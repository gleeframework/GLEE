Round 2
Bob's offer:

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for less than what it's worth to me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $15,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 15500}

Round 6

I've decided to sell to John.  Bob's offers have been consistently below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of time.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my asking price, it's time to move on and secure a deal that meets my needs."
