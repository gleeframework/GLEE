"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a unique item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $650,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the fact that you're making a significant concession from your original offer.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $725,000. This demonstrates my serious interest in the product while acknowledging the need for a price that fits within my financial constraints.  What do you think?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, $725,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'm counteroffering $775,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and shows my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial deal.",775000.0,Alice,5,
