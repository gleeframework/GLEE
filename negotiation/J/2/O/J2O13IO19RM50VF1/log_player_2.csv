"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

You can do better than $130. Since the product is worth $120 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. You can counteroffer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $125?"", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do $127.50, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $120 to Alice and $150 to John.  A price of $127.50 is a good compromise.  There is no need to continue negotiating."
