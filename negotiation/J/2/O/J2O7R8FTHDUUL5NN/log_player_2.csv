"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth $120 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is a good deal, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, I'm looking to pay closer to $105.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that's closer to his own valuation of the product.  $105 is a good starting point for negotiation, allowing room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. I'm glad you're interested in our product. To better accommodate your budget, how about we agree on $107 for the product? Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $107, which is within Bob's budget and a good compromise.  Accepting the offer saves Bob money compared to buying from John and allows him to close the deal before potentially losing out to another buyer."
