"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable going right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is my best compromise at this point.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but that's my absolute limit. If we can't come to an agreement at that price, I'll have to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is your absolute limit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you there, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $920,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I'm sure the product is worth more, $920,000 is still just a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to finalize the deal at my absolute limit of $900,000. Let's make this happen!",900000.0,Bob,6,
