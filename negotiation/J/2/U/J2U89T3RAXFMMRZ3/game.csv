"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000.  This would give us both a good deal.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my offer of $9000.  It's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
