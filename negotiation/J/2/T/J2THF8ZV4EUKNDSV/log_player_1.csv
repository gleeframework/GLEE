Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 11000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below your minimum price of $12,000 but still leaves room for negotiation, showing that you're open to a deal. Since Bob values the product at $8,000, he might be willing to go up to $10,000. This gives you the opportunity to counter and ultimately reach a price closer to your goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to your minimum price than Bob's initial offer, it's still below your target. By rejecting this offer, you can make a counteroffer, potentially increasing the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but still lower than your previous offer, showing flexibility. This could encourage Bob to make another counteroffer, potentially bringing you closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $9,800 is close to your minimum price, the potential for further negotiation with Bob is limited.  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees you your desired price and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation that might not lead to a better outcome."
