"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the market value, I believe the product's unique features and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1350000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the true value of this opportunity. Let's continue the discussion and find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
