"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a great price considering its value to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $975,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 is still too low. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $1,012,500. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you say?",1012500.0,Alice,5,
