{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum value, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation in the message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at the moment.  Would you consider $7500?  I'm really interested in the product and I think this price would be fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is more than John's offer, it's still below my minimum value of $8,000. I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point. However, $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm happy to come up to $8000.  Let's close the deal at this price, and I can pick up the product soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 meets my minimum value, so it's a good deal for me.  I'd rather sell to Bob than John, as it's more profit."
