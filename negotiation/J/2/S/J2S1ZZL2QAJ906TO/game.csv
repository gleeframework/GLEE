"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at the moment.  Would you consider $7500?  I'm really interested in the product and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point. However, $7500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8500? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm happy to come up to $8000.  Let's close the deal at this price, and I can pick up the product soon.",8000.0,Bob,4,
