"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can likely get the product for a better price than $10,000.  Since you have a backup option of buying from John for $15,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's first offer.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at the moment.  Would you consider $7,500?  I'm really interested in the product and I think this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point. However, $7500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8500? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than the $7,500 counteroffer you made.  You have a backup option with John, and the product is clearly worth less than $15,000 to you.  It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm happy to come up to $8,000.  Let's close the deal at this price, and I can pick up the product soon."", ""product_price"": 8000}
