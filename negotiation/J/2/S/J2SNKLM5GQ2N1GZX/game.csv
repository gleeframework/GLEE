"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $7,000? That's a fair offer, considering the market value.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're looking for a fair deal, Bob, but I've done my research and I know this product is worth more than what you're offering. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $8,500. That's the lowest I can go. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
