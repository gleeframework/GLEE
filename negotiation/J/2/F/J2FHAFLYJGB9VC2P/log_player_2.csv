"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed and crafted to meet your needs. This exceptional item holds a significant value of $15,000 to me, reflecting its quality, craftsmanship, and the unique features it offers. Considering its worth to you is $12,000, I propose a fair deal where you can acquire this product for $13,500. This price not only ensures a substantial return for me but also represents a fair compromise given its value to both of us. I believe this offer presents an excellent opportunity for you to benefit from its features while allowing me to recoup a considerable portion of its cost. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or finalizing this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

You can get the same product from John for $12,000, which is lower than Alice's offer of $13,500.  Therefore, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
