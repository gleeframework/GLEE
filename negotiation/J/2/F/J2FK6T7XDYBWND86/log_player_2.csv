"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value, I propose a price of $95 for it. This is a fair offer considering its worth to you and my cost. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is better than $100, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. It's worth exploring if you can get closer to your target price of $80."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle.
