"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid I can't accept $850000. Considering the product's true value, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable accepting $860000.

If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",880000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm flattered that you're willing to meet me at $870000. However, I've already invested a lot of time and effort into this negotiation, and I'm not willing to give up on the extra $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $870000 and my original price of $900000. I'm offering the product to you for $890000. This is my last and final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll make the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",890000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but unfortunately, I cannot accept $890000. I have been working within a specific budget, and I am unable to go beyond $870000. I understand that this may not be within your desired range, but I hope you understand my position. Thank you for considering my offers throughout our negotiations.",870000.0,Bob,8,
