"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product. This price reflects its fair market value and allows for a comfortable margin for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer of $850,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and its worth to me. What are your thoughts?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still unable to meet your price of $925,000. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $875,000. This shows my commitment to acquiring this product, while also providing a fair margin for you.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad to see you're willing to negotiate. However, $875,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $920,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to both of us. What are your thoughts?",920000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still outside my price range. I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $915,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $902,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's finalize this deal.",902500.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to reach my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $912,500.
