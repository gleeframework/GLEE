"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. This also gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'll be watching for his response closely and adjusting my strategy if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, it doesn't leave me any profit.  I need to try and negotiate a higher price. I'll counteroffer to see if Bob is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still trying to get a decent profit.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in my product and is willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is stuck on his $1,200,000 offer, and I'm not willing to sell for that low. I have to keep trying to negotiate a higher price. I still have time, and I'm determined to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly. I'm hoping Bob sees that I'm serious about getting a deal done, and is willing to meet me halfway.  I'm running out of time, but I'm still determined to get a good price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has finally moved slightly from his initial offer. While it's not ideal, it's a significant improvement over $1,200,000. With only 4 rounds left, it's risky to keep negotiating.  Accepting this offer ensures a profit, which is essential."
