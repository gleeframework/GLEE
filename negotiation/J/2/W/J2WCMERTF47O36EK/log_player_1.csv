Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know you value highly, for $14,000. This is a one-time offer."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $10,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $14,000 gives Bob a $1,000 incentive to buy from you rather than lose out.  You maximize your profit compared to selling to John.
* **One-Time Offer:** Creates a sense of urgency and discourages Bob from trying to negotiate a lower price."
