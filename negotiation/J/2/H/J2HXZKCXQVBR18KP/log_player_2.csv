Round 2

{""message"": ""I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm trying to be mindful of my budget, and I'm not sure I can stretch to $9,500. Can we meet in the middle at $8,000?"", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product and your offer. However, $7,000 significantly undervalues its true worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go as low as $8,000.  Would you consider $9,000?  This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Here is my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I understand that you think the product is valuable, but I still think $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,000 and $9,000, so I'll offer $8,250. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?"", ""product_price"": 8250}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $8,250 is closer, but it's still a bit low for what I can accept.  How about we meet right in the middle at $8,625? That feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,625
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
