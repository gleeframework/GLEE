"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its value. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand you're looking for a lower price, $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $1,100,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to the value I'm aiming for.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $1,075,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet at $1,090,000?  This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to get a good deal.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit above my target. I can meet you at $1,080,000, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me there?",1080000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to go a little lower, but $1,080,000 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,085,000? This is a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1085000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $1,085,000 is a bit high. I can do $1,080,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think about going to John's offer, though.",1080000.0,Bob,8,
