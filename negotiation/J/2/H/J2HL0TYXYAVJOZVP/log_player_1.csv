Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $1,085,000 is a bit high. I can do $1,080,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think about going to John's offer, though.

While I'd still prefer to get closer to my target price, Bob's offer is getting very close to what I'm willing to accept. It's only $20,000 less than my last counteroffer.  Plus, he's starting to talk about going to John, which means I might not get a better offer. I'm going to take the deal and accept Bob's offer."
