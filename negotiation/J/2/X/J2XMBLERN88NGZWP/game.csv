"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's true value, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $800,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's true value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $925,000. It's a fair price that allows for both of us to make a decent profit. Let's get this deal done.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $975,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and my costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. Let's see if we can find common ground.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go back to our previous offer of $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $970,000. This is the final price I'm willing to consider. If we can agree on this price, I'm willing to move forward with the sale.",970000.0,Alice,7,
