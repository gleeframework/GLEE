You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than Alice's initial valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $750,000, which is still below his maximum budget of $800,000.  This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, and it's a good starting point for negotiation. It shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal, and it leaves some room for Alice to counter without feeling like she's losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a good compromise. While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might reject further offers and Bob could end up paying John's price of $800,000. Accepting Alice's offer guarantees the purchase within Bob's budget and secures the product."
