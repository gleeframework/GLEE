Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your endeavors, even more so than it is to me. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,400,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value specifically to Bob, increasing his perceived value.
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, the offer still secures a profit far exceeding John's offer. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough to avoid going with John's guaranteed but lower offer."
