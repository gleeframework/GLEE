"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You can still get a good deal by going lower than $95, and there's a chance she'll accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit high for me.  How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do $90 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is still trying to get a higher price. I'm willing to pay $85, but I don't want to pay $90.  I'll try one more counteroffer before I go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $87.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 87}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. I can meet you halfway at $88.50, but I'm not going any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's more beneficial to accept Alice's offer.  While you were hoping for $85, $88.50 is still a good price, and you're risking losing the deal if you continue to counteroffer.  John's price is too high compared to Alice's current offer."
