"Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $11,500, which is a great value considering its worth to me. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still leaves some room for me to make a profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? That's a significant step up from my previous offer.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,750 is still below my minimum price point. How about we split the difference at $10,125? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let me know your thoughts.",10125.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $9,875.  It seems like we're getting closer, and this is a fair compromise considering my budget.",9875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,875 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my minimum.  Let's close this deal!",10000.0,Alice,7,
