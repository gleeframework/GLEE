"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly unique and valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to lower the price further."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this unique product. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000? I'm genuinely interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 7000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that 7000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of meeting you halfway. Would you be willing to consider 8200? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above Bob's target. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,200 is still a bit more than I'm able to spend right now. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $7,500?  I'm serious about buying this product, and I believe this price is fair considering the value it offers."", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that 7500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, Bob, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of going down to 8000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's the price I originally had in mind, and I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Would you be willing to meet me at 8000?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $8,000, which is a reasonable price considering the value of the product and Bob's budget. It's a good deal for Bob, and further negotiation might not be worth the effort. Accepting the offer allows Bob to purchase the product at a good price without risking going over his budget or losing the opportunity to purchase from Alice."
