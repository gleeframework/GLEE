Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly above Bob's perceived value:** This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob an incentive to counter.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable value:** This ensures you're not giving away too much, and you still have room to bargain if necessary.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand and respond to. 

This offer is a good starting point. By monitoring Bob's response and counter-offers, you can adjust your strategy to maximize your earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's closer to my minimum, I can still do better.  I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's lower than my initial offer:**  This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** This indicates that I'm not ready to accept his price yet. 

This offer is a reasonable middle ground that could lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still not acceptable. At this point,  it's better to sell to John and secure the higher price of $1,200,000. Further negotiation with Bob might not lead to a significantly better outcome."
