I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with the benefits it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $900,000 is better than John's offer of $1,000,000. Even though Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000), it's still a better deal for Bob than buying from John."
