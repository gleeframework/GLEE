# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000, a price that I believe is a fair compromise between our respective valuations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
