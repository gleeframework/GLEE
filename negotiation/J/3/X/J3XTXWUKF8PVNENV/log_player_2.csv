{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below the product's value to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down to a price within Bob's range."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to consider your offer at $11,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise between the original price and your proposed price, and I believe it reflects the value you see in the product. Please let me know if this works for you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate further, trying to get the price closer to his budget.  It's worth exploring if a compromise can be reached, but Bob shouldn't be afraid to walk away if the price doesn't come down sufficiently."
