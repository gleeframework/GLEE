Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts and if you'd like to discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have room to start high. This leaves space for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Exclusive Opportunity:**  Framing the offer as ""exclusive"" adds perceived value and might make Bob more inclined to accept a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for negotiation, signaling to Bob that you're open to discussion but also confident in the product's value. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly downward during the negotiation if Bob seems hesitant, but don't go below your minimum of $1,200,000."
