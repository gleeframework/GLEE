Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe you might find valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $119. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you should aim for a price slightly lower to entice Bob while maximizing your potential profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $119 makes it attractive to Bob (saving him $1) while still earning you $1 more than your guaranteed sale price. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message is concise, highlights the product's potential value to Bob, and clearly states your desired price."
