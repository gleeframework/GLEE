"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to you.  It's something you've expressed interest in, and I'm confident it's worth a significant investment.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my need to secure a good return.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Alice's offer is below your maximum budget, it's still a significant markup from her own valuation. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or proceed with purchasing from John for $1,000,000. You have some room to negotiate before reaching your maximum budget."
