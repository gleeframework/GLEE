Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think it would be perfect for you, and this is a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 allows for some back-and-forth if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, so we don't need to go any lower than that.

This strategy aims to secure a higher profit from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer if Bob declines."
