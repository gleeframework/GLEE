"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and above my minimum.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below Bob's estimated value, it's still higher than Alice's minimum. This indicates there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, which is still above your minimum and a fair price for me.  Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price.  How about $11,000?  That's still a good deal for you, considering you value the product at $12,000.  Let's try to reach an agreement! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money.  While Alice's offer is closer to his initial rejection, it's still higher than his target price.  By rejecting the offer again, Bob can attempt another counteroffer, hoping to push Alice further down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get closer to your original price, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750, which is a fair compromise.  This would allow us to both walk away feeling like we got a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we split the difference at $10,875? This would allow us to both get a good deal without sacrificing too much. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money, but he also wants to close the deal. Alice's offer of $10,875 is very close to his target price of $10,750.  It's a good compromise, and accepting it allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price, potentially leaving room for some future negotiation if necessary.  It also avoids the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer, potentially leading to a higher final price, or even the need to buy from John at a higher price."
