Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,300,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate, while still staying significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000). 
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the ""significant return on investment"" to reinforce the product's worth in Bob's eyes.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale and avoiding a lower return from John."
