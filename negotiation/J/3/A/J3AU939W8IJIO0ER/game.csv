"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a fair and competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a great value, considering its worth to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product is valuable, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000. It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,000,000 is closer, it's still a significant jump from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
