"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  Would you be open to that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and its worth to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about $11,500? That's a significant increase from my initial offer and would be a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, which is a reasonable compromise considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, We seem to be getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $12,250? It's a fair offer considering both our positions.",12250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like the spirit of compromise, but I'm still not quite there at $12,250. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which is a bit more than my initial target, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you're placing on the product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,7,
