"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but I can't go as low as $90. How about we settle at $93?",93.0,Alice,3,

I'm still not convinced that $93 is a good price for me. I'd be willing to pay $88 for it. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?,88.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you think the product is worth $90 to you, but I still think it's a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $87 for it. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",87.0,Bob,6,
