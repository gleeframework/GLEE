"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $900000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, it's still above your budget. You have the option of buying from John for $800,000, so there's room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to consider $850,000?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for this product. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'll consider selling it to you for $875000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you'd like to pay. Since you have the option to purchase from John for $800,000, it's worth pushing for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target price.  Would you be willing to go down to $825,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your target price, Bob, and I'm willing to get closer to it. However, I still need to make a decent profit on this sale. I'll consider selling it to you for $850000. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated this is her final offer. While you could continue to negotiate, it's possible you'll reach a stalemate.  $850,000 is still a good deal for you, and you risk losing the opportunity to buy from Alice completely. It's also a significant improvement over the initial offer of $900,000.  It's wise to accept the offer and secure the product."
