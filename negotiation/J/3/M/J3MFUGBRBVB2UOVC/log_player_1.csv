"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $18,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's well worth the investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to that number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $11,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a fair price for the value of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While $15,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer, but $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get him to budge a little more. There are only 6 rounds left, so I need to be careful."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm willing to go a little further to make this work.  Let's meet at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down a bit more.  I'm getting closer to my limit. Would you consider $13,200? That's a firm offer from me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now at round 6, and with only 4 rounds left, time is running out. While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not enough to meet my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  I'm not confident that I'll be able to negotiate a better price in the remaining rounds. It's better to sell to John now and guarantee a profit of $15,000."
