I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,750,000. This is above his perceived value but leaves room for negotiation, especially considering I have a backup buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I could accept and get some money, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,600,000. This is still a good profit for me and is closer to Bob's perceived value, making it more likely he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit. Considering John is willing to pay my minimum price of $1,500,000, it makes more sense to sell to John and secure a better deal."
