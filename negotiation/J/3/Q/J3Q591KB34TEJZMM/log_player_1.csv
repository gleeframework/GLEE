Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."",
 ""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming to maximize my profit. Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, starting with a price slightly below that ($115) leaves room for negotiation while still securing a good deal if he accepts immediately.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I don't want to scare Bob off with an excessively high price. By starting at $115, I signal that I'm open to negotiation and willing to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Considering John's Offer:** I always have the option to sell to John for $100, so I won't accept any offer from Bob below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer of $110 is closer to my minimum price, but I believe I can still get a better deal.
* I'll counter-offer with a price closer to my starting point to see if there's more room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $113?"",
 ""product_price"": 113
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer to show flexibility, but not conceding too much ground. 
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:** By countering with $113, I'm gauging how serious Bob is about the product and how much he's willing to pay. 
* **Staying Above John's Offer:** I'm keeping my counter-offer well above John's $100 offer, as I'm still aiming for the best possible deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I was thinking more along the lines of $108. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** While not ideal, $108 is still a profit above my minimum acceptable price ($100).
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. Bob might not go any higher, and I risk losing the sale altogether. 
* **Time Value:** Every round of negotiation takes time. Accepting now secures the deal and avoids potentially lengthy back-and-forths."
