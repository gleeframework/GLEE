Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still believe there might be room for negotiation. I would like to propose a price of $110 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $110 is the best choice at this point. It's a profit above my minimum, and continuing negotiations might not result in a better outcome."
