{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal and I think it would be very valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below my guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and a perceived ""deal"" for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, the high price still leaves a sliver of room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested, allowing for even more potential profit."
