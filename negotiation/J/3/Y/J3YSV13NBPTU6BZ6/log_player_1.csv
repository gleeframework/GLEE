Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a significant discount from my minimum desired price of $1,500,000 but leaves room for negotiation, aiming to secure a sale while still getting a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I need to try and get a better price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $900,000? This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum price, I can still do better.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to move closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $750,000 is still too low for me.  Let's try $850,000. This is a compromise that allows me to make a reasonable profit while still being within a fair range for you.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
