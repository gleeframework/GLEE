"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know is of significant value to you, for a price that's well below its worth. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows me a good return while providing you with significant value. Please consider this offer carefully. If you're not interested, I have another buyer ready to purchase it for $800,000. ",1000000.0,Alice,1,
