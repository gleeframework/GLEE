"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $80 right now. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $80. How about we meet in the middle at $120? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $120 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on $80.  It's the absolute most I can spend right now.  Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on $80, but I'm not willing to sell it that low. I'm willing to meet you at $110, which is the lowest I can go. I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",110.0,Alice,5,
