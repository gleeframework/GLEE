"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am currently only able to allocate up to $8,000 for this purchase. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's tempting to take the $8,000, but I'm holding out for a better price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $8,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price.  I'm going to try to push for a bit more with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've done some research and found out that the market value of this product is closer to what I'm willing to pay, which is $8,500. I believe this is a fair price given its current condition and the market demand. I hope we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, as $8,500 is close to my minimum. However, I've been pushing for a higher price for several rounds and Bob is not budging.  I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $12,000.  Selling to John is the best option at this point."
