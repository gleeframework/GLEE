``` 

At this point, accepting Bob's offer of $870,000 is the most strategic decision. Here's why:

* **Profitable:**  It's significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000, ensuring a good profit.
* **Time Value:** Prolonging the negotiation has diminishing returns and risks losing Bob altogether.
* **Bob's Willingness:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, showing a strong desire for the product. 

Waiting for a potentially slightly higher offer in later rounds isn't worth the risk of Bob walking away or the negotiations stalling out."
