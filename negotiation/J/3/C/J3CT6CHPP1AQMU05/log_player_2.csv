"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price. Since you are willing to pay up to $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and leaves room for negotiation. It's also a price that's still within my budget and potentially attractive to Alice since it's higher than her valuation of $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my desired range.  I want to keep pushing for a lower price and see if I can get closer to my target. Rejecting allows me to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 880000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $880,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still willing to negotiate. This is a good middle ground that balances getting a better price while keeping the deal alive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $900,000. This is a good compromise.  While I could continue to try and negotiate a lower price, I'm starting to run out of rounds.  It's likely that I won't be able to get a significantly lower offer from Alice, and the risk of her walking away or needing to buy from John at a higher price is too high.  Accepting the offer ensures I get the product at a price within my budget and saves me the risk of further negotiation."
