I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  We're very close, but I'm still determined to get as close to my desired price as possible.  I'll make one last counteroffer and see if we can finally reach an agreement.  If not, I'll sell to John."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

We're getting very close, but it looks like we won't be able to close a deal with Bob.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000. It's a better deal for me than selling to Bob, even though it's less than my ideal price."
