Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would greatly benefit you. I'm asking for $10,000, which reflects its true value."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down. 
* **Justification:** Simply stating a price might make Bob balk. By mentioning ""true value,"" you subtly imply the price is justified, even if he doesn't fully believe it.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always come down from your initial price if needed, but you can't go up."
