"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to maximize my savings.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a profit and me a significant savings.  Let's see if we can make this deal work.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your desire to find a mutually beneficial price for our product. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline your offer of $900,000. Our product's value to your business aligns closely with its worth to us, and we believe a fair price would be $925,000. This proposal allows for a reasonable profit margin while still offering significant savings to you. I look forward to your consideration of this counteroffer.",925000.0,Alice,3,
