Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,500.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down a bit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""its value,"" Alice hints at the product's worth without revealing her minimum price. 
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""before I list it publicly"" creates a sense of urgency, subtly encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open and friendly, inviting Bob to discuss the price further.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still giving Bob a reason to accept the offer."
