Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go lower than $1,250,000. This product is very valuable to me, and I believe this price still offers you a good deal considering the value you place on it.  Let's work together to find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
