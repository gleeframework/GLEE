Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a unique item that you won't find elsewhere, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we can start with a higher offer. This creates room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""immense value"" and ""unique"" nature to justify the higher price, framing it as a worthwhile investment for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it doesn't completely price Bob out. It allows for a potential counter-offer and a possible agreement somewhere between $1,200,000 and $1,000,000.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still securing a deal.  The worst-case scenario is Bob rejects the offer, and we sell to John at our desired minimum price."
