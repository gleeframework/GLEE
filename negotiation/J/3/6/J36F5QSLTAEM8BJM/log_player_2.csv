**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your preferred price.**  $1,087,500 is within your budget and only slightly higher than your last counteroffer. 
* **Time is a factor.**  You're nearing the halfway point of your negotiation rounds, and you risk losing the deal if you keep rejecting offers.
* **John's price is higher.** Buying from John would be more expensive, so accepting Alice's offer is a better financial choice."
