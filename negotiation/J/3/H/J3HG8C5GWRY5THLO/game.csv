"I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  How about $75?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. How about we meet in the middle at $100?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still looking to get the best price possible, $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $85, let's see if we can make this work.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to go up to $85, but I'm still not willing to sell for less than $110. I think the product is worth it to you, so let's meet somewhere in the middle at $97.50",97.5,Alice,5,
