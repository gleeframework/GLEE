# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000. Therefore, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John to save $150,000."
