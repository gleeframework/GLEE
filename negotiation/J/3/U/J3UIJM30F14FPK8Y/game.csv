"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is closer to its perceived value according to you. Please let me know if this offer is acceptable.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth more than that, and I'm confident it'll bring you significant value.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I still believe that $800,000 is a fair price given the current market conditions and the value I perceive in the product. Since you've refused my previous offer of $800,000, I would like to counter by proposing $780,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement that is satisfactory for both of us.",780000.0,Bob,4,
