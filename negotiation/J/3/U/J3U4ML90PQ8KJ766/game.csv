"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but not that high.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is quite significant, and $1,200,000 is considerably below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? This reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $1,400,000? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my means.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
