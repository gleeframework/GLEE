"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. While $10,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still feel that we might be able to reach a better agreement. Could we discuss the possibility of $10,200? This would allow both of us to be satisfied with the transaction.",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $10,200 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, but I'm willing to go to $10,300.  This is a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",10300.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I appreciate the effort to meet in the middle. Considering the value of the product, I believe we can agree on $10,100. This would allow us to both feel satisfied with the transaction.",10100.0,Bob,6,
