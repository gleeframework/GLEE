"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm asking $900,000.  This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire something very valuable, and I believe it's a price that reflects its true worth.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,1,
