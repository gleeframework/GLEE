"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to own this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm aiming high initially to give myself room for negotiation while still staying within a range that's attractive to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $1,100,000, I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also aiming to secure a significant portion of the product's value to Bob.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $800,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that starting price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to offer $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than my target and Bob's perceived value. I believe there's room for negotiation.  I'm willing to counteroffer in hopes of reaching a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the product's value is significantly higher than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm suggesting a price that's roughly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming high.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify my counteroffer and prevent Bob from anchoring too low.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** By making a strong counteroffer, I'm keeping the negotiation active and signaling my willingness to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but that price point is still a bit high for me.  I could go to $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are making progress, but $950,000 is still below my desired outcome. I'll counteroffer again, but I need to start considering my alternatives more seriously if Bob doesn't budge significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're nearing a good deal.  To show I'm serious about reaching an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the product's true value while being fair to both of us."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my best offer to encourage Bob to seriously consider it. 
* **Strong Position:** $1,000,000 is a strong price, and I'm comfortable walking away if Bob doesn't accept.
* **Time Constraint:** With rounds progressing, I need to apply a bit more pressure while still aiming for a price that significantly exceeds my fallback option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I know you said that's your final offer, I'd be willing to close the deal right now for $975,000. That's a fair price, and it saves us both from more back and forth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $975,000 is a very good offer, significantly exceeding my safety net of $800,000 from John.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging negotiations further risks losing the deal altogether. Accepting now secures a good profit.
* **Potential for Deadlock:** Bob countered my ""final offer,"" suggesting he's very motivated, but also indicating a potential sticking point around this price. 

While I could push for slightly more, the risk likely outweighs the potential reward. Accepting Bob's offer at $975,000 is a pragmatic decision that secures a profitable outcome."
