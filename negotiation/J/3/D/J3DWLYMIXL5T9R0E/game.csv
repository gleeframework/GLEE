"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get closer to the value I believe it's worth to me. Let me know if you're willing to consider this price.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're eager to get the product, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $12,250. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm proposing $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider this price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
