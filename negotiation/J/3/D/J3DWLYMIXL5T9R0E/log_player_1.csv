{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation, but also ensures I get a significant profit. I'm confident Bob will counter, and I'll be ready to negotiate further. If he's not interested, I can always fall back on John's offer for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get closer to the value I believe it's worth to me. Let me know if you're willing to consider this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,500 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're eager to get the product, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $12,250. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm proposing $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me, considering Bob's initial offer and the risk of him walking away.  I'm getting closer to my ideal price, and it's significantly better than selling to John.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
