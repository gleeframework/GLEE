"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $750,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $825,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",800000.0,Bob,4,
