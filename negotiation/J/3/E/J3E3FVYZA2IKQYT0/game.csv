"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe this is a fair price given the market value and my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $600,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your budget concerns.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $600,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $850,000, so I'm thinking $775,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,6,
