Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe this is a fair price given the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $600,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your budget concerns."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $600,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer to my baseline, but I'm still willing to hold out for a higher price from Bob. I'll counter with a figure closer to my minimum to signal I'm getting serious."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, but this is my final offer. This price reflects the product's significant value while recognizing your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $850,000, so I'm thinking $775,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to $850,000, Bob's offer of $775,000 is reasonably close to my bottom line. Accepting now avoids the risk of him walking away and ensures I make a good profit.  It's always better to secure a good deal than to hold out for the ideal and potentially lose the sale altogether."
