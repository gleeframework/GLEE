# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm glad we're getting closer.  $900000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're both trying to find a solution. $910000 is closer but still not quite there. To avoid dragging this out any longer, I'm willing to drop my price to $915000.  This is my final offer.  It's a fair price for both of us and lets us finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to your price, but $915,000 is still above your budget.

You're guaranteed to get the product and avoid the possibility of Alice making a counteroffer that forces you to pay more than your budget allows."
