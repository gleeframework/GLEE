Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}

I'm starting with a significant discount to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $120 is a good starting point, offering a decent savings while still leaving room for potential compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
