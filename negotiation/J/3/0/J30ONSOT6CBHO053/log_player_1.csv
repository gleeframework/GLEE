Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm starting with an offer of $18,000. This is a good starting point as it's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 

I'll be watching closely for Bob's response and will adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer. If he rejects and makes a counteroffer that's too low, I'll be prepared to make a counteroffer or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm not eager to lose this sale,  $14,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $16,000. This is still a bit above Bob's initial offer but shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I believe this price is fair, and I'm hoping it will be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  I've reached a point where I'm comfortable accepting his offer and closing the deal. It's not my ideal price, but it's a fair outcome considering the negotiation process."
