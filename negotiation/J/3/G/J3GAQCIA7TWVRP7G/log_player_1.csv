I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $10,000 is still too low for me. I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is just too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  That's still a fantastic price for you, and it gives me a bit closer to what I'm looking for.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
