"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $16000. Can you consider that?",16000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $16000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice. However, $18000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $17000. Can you consider that?",17000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're still in the conversation, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $18500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm open to negotiations.",18500.0,Alice,5,
