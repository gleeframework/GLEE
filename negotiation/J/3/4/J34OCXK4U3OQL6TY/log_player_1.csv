{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000 but leaving room for negotiation.  It's also above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, so I'm not risking a loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is closer to my ideal price, but I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, $925,000 is a good compromise.  It's significantly better than selling to John for $800,000, and the negotiation seems to be stalling.  There's a chance Bob won't budge further, and I don't want to risk losing this deal completely."
