"Hi Alice, thanks for offering the product to me!  $20,000 is a bit steep for my budget though.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $10,000 is too low for me. Could you do $17,000? I'm willing to compromise to make this work for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $10,000 is a big jump, Alice.  I'm willing to increase my offer, but $17,000 is still more than I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
