"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think it could be really valuable for you. I'm looking for a price around $20,000 to make it worth my while. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum budget.  You should definitely counter-offer, aiming to bring the price down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering the product to me!  $20,000 is a bit steep for my budget though.  Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** While $10,000 is still a significant distance from Alice's asking price, it's important to start with a counteroffer that gives you room to negotiate. 
* **Polite and Positive:**  The message aims to maintain a good negotiating relationship with Alice. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $10,000 is too low for me. Could you do $17,000? I'm willing to compromise to make this work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** $17,000 remains significantly higher than your $8,000 maximum. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to lower her price suggests there's flexibility.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** You can use John's $8,000 offer as leverage in further negotiations, aiming to bring Alice's price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that $10,000 is a big jump, Alice.  I'm willing to increase my offer, but $17,000 is still more than I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"",
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer suggests a common negotiation tactic, aiming to find a compromise.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  Offering $13,000 keeps you below your $15,000 maximum while still showing Alice you're willing to move upward.
* **Testing Alice's Flexibility:**  This offer will reveal if Alice is truly committed to finding a deal or if she's unwilling to budge much further."
