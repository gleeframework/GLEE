Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good compromise because:

* It's a price higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000, giving him a potential benefit.
* It's a price lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, allowing me to potentially close the deal with Bob.

If Bob rejects the offer, I can still secure my minimum value by selling to John for $15,000. This strategy maximizes my chances of getting a higher price while still having a backup plan."
