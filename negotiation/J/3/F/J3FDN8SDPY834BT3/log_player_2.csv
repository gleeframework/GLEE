# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800000. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price, but I think this is a great starting point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
