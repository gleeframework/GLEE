"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm starting significantly above both my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Confident and Open Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value while expressing a willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to engage. 
* **Leaving Room for Bob:**  By inviting Bob's thoughts, I encourage him to counter-offer, giving me more information to work with in subsequent rounds.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  There's a chance Bob might accept a high offer.
2. **Gather Information:**  Bob's counter-offer will reveal how much he values the product and how aggressively he's willing to negotiate. 
3. **Control the Negotiation:** By starting high, I set the initial bargaining range and influence the direction of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above his perceived value of $1,000,000, indicating he's genuinely interested. However, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 

I'll reject this offer to signal that I'm looking for a better deal and use the next round to strategically counter-offer. I'm not yet ready to sell to John because I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is below my minimum for this product.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've significantly reduced my price from $1,600,000 to $1,450,000.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still staying well above both my minimum and Bob's offer. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning a ""fair deal,"" I'm subtly anchoring the negotiation around the idea of mutual benefit rather than just my bottom line.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will reveal if Bob is willing to move closer to my range or if he's firmly set around the $1,100,000 mark."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I still believe we can reach a fair agreement within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I could try to negotiate for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, or I might miss out on a good deal by being too greedy. 

Accepting this offer secures a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of continuing the negotiation."
