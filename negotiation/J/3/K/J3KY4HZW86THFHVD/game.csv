"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit, but $95 is just a bit too low for me. How about $105? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $98. Can you meet me in the middle?",98.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. How about we split the difference and settle on $101? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know if you're interested.",101.0,Alice,5,
