"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, but we're willing to let it go for $95. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  $95 is close to my maximum, but there's room to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $95 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your honesty. I'd like to offer the product at $90, which I believe is a fair compromise considering its value to you. Please let me know if this offer suits you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

$90 is a fair compromise and still saves me some money compared to buying from John."
