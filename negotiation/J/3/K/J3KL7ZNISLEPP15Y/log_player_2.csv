"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $200. What do you think?

You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $130 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $75? That's a fair offer, considering it's much closer to my budget."", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $75 is too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $100. This is my final offer, take it or leave it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

It's unlikely Alice will go below $100. It's better to buy from John for $80 and save the money."
