This offer gives me a good starting point above my minimum price. I've left room for negotiation, but also clearly stated the value the product holds for Bob."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,200,000. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below $1,200,000. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal price."
