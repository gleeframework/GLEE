"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1,150,000? This is a fair compromise, and it still gives you a good deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  This offer is fair to both of us, and it allows us to make a deal. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
