"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While I'm interested, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9500.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find a good deal at that price.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
