Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Alice knows Bob values the product significantly, even if it's less than her own valuation. Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above John's offer.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's ""unique value proposition,"" subtly justifying the high price without revealing specific details. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message keeps the conversation open by inviting Bob's thoughts and suggesting further discussion. This allows Alice to gauge Bob's interest and potentially adjust her price slightly downward if needed.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to secure the highest possible price from Bob. While Alice has a guaranteed offer from John, selling to Bob at a price even slightly above $1,200,000 would be ideal."
