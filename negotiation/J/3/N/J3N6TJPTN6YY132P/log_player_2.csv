# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is an amazing deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product, and John is offering it at that price, there's no immediate need to accept Alice's offer.  Rejecting gives you the opportunity to see if you can negotiate a lower price with Alice or find another seller with a better deal."
