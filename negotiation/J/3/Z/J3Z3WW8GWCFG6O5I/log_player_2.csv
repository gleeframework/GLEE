"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer of $12,000 is a good deal. It's significantly less than your maximum budget of $15,000 and saves you money compared to buying from John."
