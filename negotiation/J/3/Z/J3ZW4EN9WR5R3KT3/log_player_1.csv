"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is far too low. It's worth exploring if we can find a middle ground, but selling to John for $1,500,000 is always an option if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise and come down to $1,750,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1750000 is a step in the right direction, it's still beyond my budget. I'm confident that this product has value, but I'm only able to offer $1200000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential I see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $1,500,000, but it's getting closer. I'll see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but $1,200,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down further, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the value it holds.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution. $1400000 is getting closer, but still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1300000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer, his offer is still below my minimum of $1,500,000.  I'll counter and see if we can reach a deal, but John remains a viable option if things don't work out."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,300,000 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000.
