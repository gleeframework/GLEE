"Alice,  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and it's within my budget.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, which is closer to your budget and still allows me to get a reasonable price. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go to $1,025,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's make this happen.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
