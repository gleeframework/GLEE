{""product_price"": 20000}

This is a starting point. I'm aiming high with $20,000, knowing the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  It's a good strategy to start high and see if Bob is willing to bite."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll try to counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price for him, while still allowing me to get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is getting too low for my comfort. While I could try to counteroffer again, it's becoming a drawn-out process and I'm already risking losing too much profit.  I'll take the guaranteed $15,000 from John and move on."
