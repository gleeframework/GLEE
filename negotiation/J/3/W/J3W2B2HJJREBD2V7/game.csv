"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the value,  $1,100,000 is significantly below what I can accept. Let's meet closer to the middle - how about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm happy to continue negotiating and see if we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000 for this product.  This offer is fair and reflects the value I see in the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
