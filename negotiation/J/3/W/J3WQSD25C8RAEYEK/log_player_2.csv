"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. I think this is a great price considering the value it brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is far above his maximum budget of $10,000.  It's better to try to negotiate with Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this unique product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $14,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price. There's still room to negotiate, and he shouldn't feel pressured to accept just because Alice met him ""halfway"".  It's still a better strategy to try to negotiate further or consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise. It's still well above what I can get elsewhere, and I think it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,500 is getting closer to his budget, it's still a significant amount more than what he is willing to pay. He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a lower price. There is still room to negotiate and he shouldn't feel pressured to accept the offer just because it's a ""compromise""."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still above my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway again, and offer $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product.  Let's make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13,500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice has come down a bit, $13,000 is still above Bob's budget. He's already had several rounds of negotiations and it seems like there isn't much more room for Alice to come down further.  At this point, it's more efficient to buy from John for $10,000."
