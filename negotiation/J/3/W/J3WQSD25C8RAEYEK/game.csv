"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this unique product.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise. It's still well above what I can get elsewhere, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still above my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway again, and offer $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product.  Let's make this deal work.",12500.0,Bob,6,
