This offer is exclusive to you and represents a substantial savings compared to its true worth. I am confident that this investment will not only meet but exceed your expectations. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good deal:**  It's below your maximum price of $1,500,000 and significantly lower than the product's worth to you. 
* **Buying from John is more expensive:**  While you can buy from John, it's a worse deal financially. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $300,000."
