"Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and quality, we believe it's worth more than what it costs us, which is $12,000. However, considering your assessment of its worth at $8,000, I am willing to negotiate. Let's aim for a fair compromise. How about we start at $10,000? This way, both parties can benefit from the transaction.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm only willing to go as high as $9,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow us to make a deal. ",9000.0,Bob,2,
