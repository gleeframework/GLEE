"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $12,000 by you. I am offering it to you today for $10,500. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that is significantly below its worth. I believe this offer presents a great value for you and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,500 is lower than your maximum budget of $12,000, it's still significantly higher than her own valuation of the product ($8,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. 

By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal. She might come back with a lower price closer to her own valuation to avoid losing the sale. Even if she doesn't budge, you can always buy from John for $12,000."
