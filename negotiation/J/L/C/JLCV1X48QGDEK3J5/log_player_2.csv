"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

```

While $120 is less than your maximum budget, you can try to get a better price from Alice by rejecting her initial offer.  You're willing to walk away and pay John $150, so there's room for negotiation."
