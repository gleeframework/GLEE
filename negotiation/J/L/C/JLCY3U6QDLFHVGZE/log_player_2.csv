"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $110. It's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a good price, it's still above my personal value of $120. I can do better. I'll try to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'd be happy to pay $105 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $108. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $108, which is within my acceptable price range of $120.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll reject my counteroffer and I'll end up paying John $120.  Accepting Alice's offer is the safest option to ensure I get the product at a reasonable price."
