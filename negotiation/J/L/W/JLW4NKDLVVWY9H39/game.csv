"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at over a million dollars to me, but I understand its value might be different for you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount you're providing. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $750000 to $800000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",775000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is tempting, it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850000.  This price still allows me to recoup a good portion of the value I place on this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price point.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Given my financial situation, I am comfortable considering an offer closer to $800000. Would it be possible for us to meet somewhere in this range?",800000.0,Bob,4,
