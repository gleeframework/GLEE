,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is far too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I can't justify paying more than $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value. However, my initial assessment of the product's worth remains firm. To move towards a mutually agreeable deal, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,900,000. This adjustment reflects my desire to find a compromise while ensuring a fair return on this unique product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,900,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1,400,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher.  I believe this price offers us both a fair opportunity to close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your willingness to move on price is encouraging, and I want to find a way for us to close this deal. I'm prepared to make my final offer at $1,650,000.  This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it represents a fair and attractive price for a product of this caliber.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but it's still a little more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, but I can't go any higher.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to close this deal.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
