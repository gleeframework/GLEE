"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to go slightly higher than $10,000. I'll offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
