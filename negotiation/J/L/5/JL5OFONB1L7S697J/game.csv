"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you'll really appreciate.

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $800000. Can you consider a price closer to that range?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $700000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's unique features and potential value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1100000. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1100000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget of $800000. Can you consider a price of $900000?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for the product. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1000000. I'm willing to make a small concession, though. I can offer it to you for $975000. It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in your business.",975000.0,Alice,5,
