"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, and we're willing to sell it to you for $85. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price.  There's no need to rush into the first offer, especially since Bob has 10 rounds and a fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you consider $75? "", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we offer the product for $80? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is a decent price, Bob can still aim for a lower price. He's shown willingness to negotiate, and Alice has adjusted her offer, indicating she's open to further compromise.  There's no rush to accept yet, especially with multiple rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle at $78.  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 78}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your suggestion, how about we aim for $79? I believe this price reflects a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer and is now only $1 away from Bob's last counteroffer.  It's likely that further negotiation will only yield small changes, and at this point, the risk of losing the deal to John is a factor. Accepting the offer at $79 is the best option to secure the product at a good price."
