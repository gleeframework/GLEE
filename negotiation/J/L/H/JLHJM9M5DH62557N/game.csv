"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal considering its worth to me is significantly higher. Let me know your thoughts!",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay that much. I'm thinking of offering $9,500 for the product. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. Can you consider that?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  However,  $10,250 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to go down to $10,400. This feels like a fair compromise, and I believe we can close the deal here.",10400.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to your price point, Alice, but I'm still not ready to commit to $10,400. I'm willing to meet you at $10,300. Can you consider that?",10300.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. Let's split the difference and go with $10,350. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident this is a good deal for you. What do you say?",10350.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,350. I'm willing to go up to $10,300, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",10300.0,Bob,8,
