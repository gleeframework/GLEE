"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I propose a starting price of $1,300,000. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,100,000 is certainly appealing, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,225,000. This reflects a fair compromise, don't you think?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I still think the product is overpriced. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll make a counteroffer of $1,175,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on the price.  Let's settle this right now.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
