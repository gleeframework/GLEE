# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  While $9,500 is more than the product is worth to Alice, it's still cheaper than buying from John for $10,000. 
* **You can save money:**  Accepting Alice's offer allows you to save $500 compared to buying from John."
