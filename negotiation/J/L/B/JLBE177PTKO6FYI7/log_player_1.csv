Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $18,000. This is a good starting point for a negotiation. It gives me room to lower the price if necessary, while still making a good profit.  I don't know Bob's value for the product, so this offer is a good starting point."
