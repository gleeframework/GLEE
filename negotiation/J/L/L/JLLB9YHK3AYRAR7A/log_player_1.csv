"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not starting at my absolute minimum, giving myself space to compromise if necessary. 
* **Focusing on Value:** I subtly remind Bob of the product's value to him,  making the price seem more reasonable. 

**Remember:**  This is just the first round. I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is below my minimum of $15,000 and significantly below my initial offer of $12,000.  While it's tempting to take the $10,500, I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price closer to my desired minimum.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to potentially get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,500. This takes into account the value you place on the product and gives you a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering with $11,500, which is halfway between my initial offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($10,500). This shows flexibility while staying within my target range.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, subtly suggesting that $11,500 is still a good deal for him. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Goal:** 

I'm aiming for a compromise that's closer to my desired minimum of $15,000. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I want to see if Bob is willing to move closer to my price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $11500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11000.  This seems like a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, $11,000 is still below my minimum of $15,000. I have 6 rounds left and I'm not willing to settle for anything below my minimum just yet. I believe I can push for a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $11,000 still doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250.  This feels like a fair balance, considering the product's value and our desire to find a good solution.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Slight Compromise:** I'm offering a slight compromise, moving down to $11,250 from my previous offer of $11,500. This shows flexibility and signals my willingness to reach an agreement. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to reinforce the legitimacy of my price point.
* **Positive Language:**  I'm using positive and encouraging language to create a sense of momentum and urge Bob towards an agreement.

**Goal:** 

By offering $11,250, I'm aiming to strike a compromise that feels fair to both of us. It's still within my acceptable range, and I'm hopeful Bob will see the value in finalizing a deal."
