"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to get close to my minimum of $150.  If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but it's closer than my initial offer.  I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for something in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm offering $160, which is halfway between my last offer and Bob's counteroffer. This should keep the negotiation moving and hopefully get us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is above my minimum of $150 and we're already in round 4. I'm confident I can close the deal with John later if this one falls through, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
