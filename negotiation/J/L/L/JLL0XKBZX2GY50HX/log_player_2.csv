"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for less than $1,000,000 from Alice, as the product is worth $800,000 to her.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still willing to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $1,200,000 and closer to the product's actual worth of $800,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might walk away, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price."
