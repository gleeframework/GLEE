Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an aggressive offer of $1,400,000. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters, while still exceeding my minimum desired price of $1,200,000.  I'm confident Bob will be willing to pay a premium, as the product is worth the same to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000, so I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,300,000.  This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this will get us closer to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to go lower than $1,200,000.  Selling to John is a sure thing and guarantees my minimum desired price."
