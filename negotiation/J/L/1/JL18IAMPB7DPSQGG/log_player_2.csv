It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can likely get a better price than $120."

I'm offering Alice $100, which is still a good deal for her since it's above her value of $80. This gives us a good starting point for negotiation."

Alice is still too high. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John."

Alice is being stubborn and isn't budging much. I've already made two counteroffers, and her last offer was still too high. With only 5 rounds left, it's not worth risking further negotiation. Buying from John is the safer option to ensure I get the product within my budget."
