Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you have room to negotiate above that price with Bob.
* **Starting High:**  A higher initial offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Justification:** While simply stating a price is an option, providing a brief reason (""great deal for the value"") might increase the perceived worth.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $150. This strategy aims for the best possible outcome while acknowledging you have a fallback option with John."
