Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why $14,000?** This offer is a compromise. It's higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($12,000), but lower than what you could get from John ($15,000). 
* **Reasoning:**  
    * There's a chance Bob will accept, as he still gets a good deal.
    * If he rejects, you're still guaranteed to get $15,000 from John. 

This strategy maximizes your chances of getting a good price while minimizing your risk."
