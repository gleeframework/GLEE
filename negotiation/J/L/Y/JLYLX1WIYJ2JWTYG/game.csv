"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $900000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1000000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering the product for $1050000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $950000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and what I've seen from other sellers. Can you meet me at this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which is the absolute minimum I can accept.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my potential profit.  I believe this offer reflects the value of the product for both of us.  ",1000000.0,Alice,5,
