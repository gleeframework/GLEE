"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique and valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me is at least $1000000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $800000 is significantly lower than my initial expectation. Considering its potential value, I'd be willing to pay $1000000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your enthusiasm for the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $1000000. Considering its worth to me is at least $1000000, I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $950000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's value while also being reasonable for you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $950000, but I'm still hesitant.  I'm willing to meet you at $975000. This is a fair compromise, and it's very close to my upper limit.  I'm confident that this price will be mutually beneficial, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement quickly.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $925000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950000.
