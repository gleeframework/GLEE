{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is far too high.  It's in Bob's best interest to try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is still offering a price that is higher than Bob's maximum.  While closer, there is still room for negotiation. It's worth attempting to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is still too high. While closer, Bob can likely still get a better deal if he continues negotiating. He's also nearing the point where he might need to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is again trying to split the difference. He's increased his offer by $25,000, showing continued willingness to negotiate, but still maintaining his budget. This might be a strong enough counteroffer to persuade Alice to accept, especially as the rounds are nearing the end."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget. While there might be a chance to negotiate further, with only three rounds remaining, the risk of failing to reach an agreement is too high.  It's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John at a guaranteed price within his budget."
