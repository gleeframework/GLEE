"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a great asset to your business.  My asking price is $1150000.  This is a fair price considering the value and potential of this product.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is less than Alice's value of $1,200,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by counteroffering.  He knows he can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so he has room to negotiate with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer.  While $1050000 is closer to my desired price, I need to consider the true value of this product to me. I'm willing to come down to $1100000,  This reflects a fair compromise while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the lowest possible price.  While $1,100,000 is lower than Alice's previous offer, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John.  He has room to negotiate further and potentially secure a better deal."
