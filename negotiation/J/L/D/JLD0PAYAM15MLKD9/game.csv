"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1150000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Considering the market value and my budget, I'm prepared to offer $1050000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer.  While $1050000 is closer to my desired price, I need to consider the true value of this product to me. I'm willing to come down to $1100000,  This reflects a fair compromise while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me.  Given the market value and my budget, I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1050000. I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's try to close this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
