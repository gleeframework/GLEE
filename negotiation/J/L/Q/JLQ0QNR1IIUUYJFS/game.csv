"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I can do $11,500, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great price, considering the value this product will bring to your business.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. $11,500 is closer, but still a little high for my budget. Could we meet in the middle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I can meet you halfway between $10,750 and $11,500, which would be $11,125. That's the lowest I can go.",11125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and land at $10,937.50?  That's a fair compromise.",10937.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still in negotiation, Bob. However, I think $10,937.50 is still a bit low for me. I can do $11,250, which is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to budge a little more. How about $11,093.75?  It's a small increase from my last offer and shows I'm serious about closing the deal.",11093.75,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to budge, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I can do $11,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. Let's see if we can wrap this up.",11500.0,Alice,9,
