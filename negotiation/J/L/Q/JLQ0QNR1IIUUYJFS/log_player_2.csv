It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and go with John. Here's why:

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Alice went back up to her previous offer of $11,500. This indicates she's unlikely to move much lower.
* **Time Constraint:** You're in round 9 with only one round left. Even if you counter, there's a low chance of getting a significantly better deal from Alice.
* **Guaranteed Price:** John offers a guaranteed price of $15,000. While higher than you'd like, it's better than risking no deal with Alice and potentially missing out on the product entirely. 

While it's disappointing to pay more than you hoped, sometimes cutting your losses and securing the product is the most strategic move in a negotiation."
