"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is lower than I expected, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $11,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your coming up on your offer. While $10,250 is closer, I'm still hoping to get closer to $11,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,625?  This is a great deal for you, and it would allow us to finalize the sale.",10625.0,Alice,5,
