{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $12,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This price gives Bob an incentive to counteroffer, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The knowledge of John's $15,000 offer gives me a safety net, meaning I can be more firm in negotiations if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even below Bob's perceived value of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since Bob has shown interest in the product. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  While John's offer of $15,000 is tempting,  I'm not desperate to sell and can afford to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is lower than I expected, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $11,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $12,500 to $11,000.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:**  $11,000 is still below my minimum, but it's closer to Bob's perceived value of $10,000.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""good deal"" aspect for Bob to incentivize him to accept. 
* **Continuing Negotiation:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going, giving me a chance to potentially close a deal at a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $9,000. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10,250. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $10,250 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my perceived value of $15,000.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and is getting closer to my price range. There's still room for improvement.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Although John's offer of $15,000 is tempting, I believe I can get closer to that amount by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your coming up on your offer. While $10,250 is closer, I'm still hoping to get closer to $11,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,625?  This is a great deal for you, and it would allow us to finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 10625}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing a willingness to meet Bob halfway by splitting the difference between my previous offer of $11,000 and his offer of $10,250.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** $10,625 is still below my desired price but is within a reasonable range for Bob, as it's closer to his perceived value of $10,000.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the ""great deal"" aspect for Bob to encourage him to accept.
* **Finality:**  This counteroffer might signal to Bob that this is my final offer, increasing the chances of him accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not willing to go above $10,000. I'd be willing to pay $9,750 for the product. This is my final offer, so please let me know if it's acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Final Offer is Too Low:**  $9,750 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even below Bob's perceived value of $10,000.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob has made it clear this is his final offer, and there's little chance of him going higher. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** John's offer of $15,000 is now a much more attractive option, as it guarantees me a price that meets my minimum requirements.

It's time to cut my losses and accept John's offer. Further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to yield a better result."
