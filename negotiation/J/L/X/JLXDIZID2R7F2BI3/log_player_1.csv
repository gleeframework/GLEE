Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it will be a valuable asset to you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if you can get even more from Bob.
* **Reasonable Markup:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 provides a significant profit margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob, who values it at $1,000,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong initial offer, the message leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate, allowing you to gauge his interest further. 

**Important:** This strategy aims to balance profit maximization with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. If you started with an offer too close to $1,200,000, Bob would likely reject it, and you'd miss out on the opportunity to potentially earn more."
