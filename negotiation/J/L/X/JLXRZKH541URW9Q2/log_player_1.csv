Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me right now.  How about we bring it down closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're at your limit, and I appreciate your honesty.  While $800,000 is less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept it on the condition that you [insert a small, mutually beneficial add-on here, like a referral, testimonial, or future collaboration opportunity].  It's a win-win for both of us."",

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're at Round 5 of 10.  Waiting much longer risks Bob walking away.
* **Bob's ""Final Offer"":**  This often means he's close to his actual limit.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While John offers $1,200,000, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. A sure $800,000 now is better than risking no deal at all.
* **The ""Sweetener"":** Adding a small, non-monetary element can make Bob feel like he got a concession while providing you extra value. Examples:
    * ""Include a positive testimonial about the product""
    * ""Refer another potential buyer to me in the future""
    * ""Collaborate on a small project related to this product's field"""
