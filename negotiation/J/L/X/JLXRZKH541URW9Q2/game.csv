"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me right now.  How about we bring it down closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price, however, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's say $900,000, and we have a deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that's still a bit further than I'd like to go.  Could you do $800,000?  That's my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're at your limit, and I appreciate your honesty.  While $800,000 is less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept it on the condition that you [insert a small, mutually beneficial add-on here, like a referral, testimonial, or future collaboration opportunity].  It's a win-win for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,5,
