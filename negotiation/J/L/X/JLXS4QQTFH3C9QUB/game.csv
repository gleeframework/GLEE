"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However,  $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000.  I'm still not quite there yet. Let's split the difference -  how about $1,075,000?  It's a fair compromise for both of us. ",1075000.0,Bob,4,
