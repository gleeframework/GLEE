"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be beneficial for both of us if you were to purchase it at a special introductory price of $13,500. This offer is exclusive to you and valid for the next 7 days. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for Bob at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the introductory price, but my budget is a bit tighter than that. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to negotiate further. In light of this, I propose a price of $13,000 for the product. This still allows for a reasonable profit while being competitive with your offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to stay within his $12,000 budget.  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant at $13,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,750? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. Let's aim for a mutual agreement. Considering your proposal, I suggest a price of $12,900 for the product. This offers a slight increase from my previous offer and keeps the deal attractive for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,900 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  While further negotiation is possible, Bob has already gone through several rounds and it's clear that Alice isn't willing to go much lower. It's becoming increasingly likely that the negotiation will drag on, potentially wasting valuable time. Given the opportunity to buy from John at his target price, Bob should take the opportunity and buy the product from John."
