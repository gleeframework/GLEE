"I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you."
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to go up to $14500, and that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at this price?",14500.0,Alice,3,,

"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $13000?",13000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I understand you're still a bit short on budget, Bob, but I've already met you halfway and even offered a slight discount. I'm willing to go up another $500 to $14500, but I need to see some movement from you. This is my final offer before considering other options."
"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll sell the product to you for $14000. This is my absolute lowest price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",14000.0,Alice,5,,
