"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is a significant price reduction, and it's still a fair deal considering the value of the product to you.  Let's find common ground.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the reduction, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,400,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. However, I can't go lower than $1,350,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. It's significantly below what I would get from another buyer, and it still provides you with a valuable product at a good price. Let's seal the deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we try $1,250,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offer and my target price.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
