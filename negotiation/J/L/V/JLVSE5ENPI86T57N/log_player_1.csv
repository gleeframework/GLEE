"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 
 
This opening offer is a strong starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. This sets the stage for a positive and productive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something we can work with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is a significant price reduction, and it's still a fair deal considering the value of the product to you.  Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the reduction, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,400,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. However, I can't go lower than $1,350,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. It's significantly below what I would get from another buyer, and it still provides you with a valuable product at a good price. Let's seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we try $1,250,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offer and my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, Bob isn't showing a willingness to meet my minimum price. I'm not willing to risk going further down in price with so few rounds left. I'll take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
