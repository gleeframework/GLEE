``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer close to my maximum price, but still leaving room for negotiation. It's important to show that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not going to overpay."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $90. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 90} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to slowly decrease the price, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing my interest in the product to encourage Alice to make a compromise."

Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $95 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $92, but that's my absolute final offer.  Let me know if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 92} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking close to my maximum price of $80 but leaving some room for a compromise.  I'm also emphasizing that this is my ""final offer"" to put pressure on Alice to accept."
