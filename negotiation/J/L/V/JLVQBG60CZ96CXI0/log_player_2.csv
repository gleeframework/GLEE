"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get the product for a lower price than $11,500.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better deal.  While there's a risk Alice might not counteroffer, or counteroffer with a price too high, the potential for saving money makes rejecting the offer the better choice at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like.  How about $11,000?  That's a fair compromise and still a great deal for you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $11,500 to $11,000.  This is still a good deal for Bob, as he is willing to pay up to $12,000.  It's a better price than what John is offering, and it avoids the risk of further negotiations that could potentially lead to a higher price or a breakdown in the negotiations."
