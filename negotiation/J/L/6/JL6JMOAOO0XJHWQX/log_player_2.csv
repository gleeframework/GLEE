You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's room to negotiate with Alice and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm offering Alice $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering I can get it for $8,000 from John, and it leaves some room for Alice to negotiate while still getting a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  I can get the product for $8,000 from John, so it's better to go with that option and avoid further negotiation."
