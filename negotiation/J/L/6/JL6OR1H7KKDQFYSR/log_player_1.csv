Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in your product, but I'd be more comfortable with a price closer to $85.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $90 is still a little high for me. I'm really hoping to stay under $85. How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? That feels like a fair compromise for both of us.
