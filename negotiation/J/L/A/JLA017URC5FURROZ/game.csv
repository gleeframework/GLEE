"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this with me. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is your maximum budget, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being reasonable for me.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you at $1,100,000. This would be a great deal for both of us.  I believe this price fairly reflects the value of the product and allows for a successful transaction. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
