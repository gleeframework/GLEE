"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $120. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a competitive price. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $110. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $100, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can you consider that price?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, $100 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $115. This is the best I can do, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $115, and I'm still considering buying from John. Can you meet me at $105? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $115, Bob. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a free accessory. This is a one-time offer, so I'm sticking with my price of $115.",115.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. Can you consider $108? That's the best I can do.",108.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to meet you at $108, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise a bit more. I'm counteroffering at $112. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the extras I'm including.",112.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm really not willing to go any higher than $108, and I'm starting to think it's time to walk away. Can you meet me at $108, or I'll have to consider buying from John?",108.0,Bob,10,
