{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** The message focuses on the value of the product and the ""great deal"" aspect to encourage Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy:

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've made a good profit.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll consider his counteroffer and weigh the risk of continuing to negotiate with him versus selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's a bit steep for me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $60 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $120 and is even lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($80). Accepting would result in a substantial loss for me. 
* **Opportunity to counter:**  I have the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price closer to my desired range.
* **John's offer as backup:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's low offer. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll craft a counteroffer that's higher than $60 but still lower than my starting price of $100. I'll also emphasize the value of the product in my message to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is a bit too low for me.  The product is worth more than that, and I'm confident it would be a great investment for you.  How about we split the difference and go with $85? It's still a good deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer in the middle:**  I'm offering $85, which is halfway between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $60.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still getting closer to my target price.
* **Emphasize value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, implying that it's worth more than $60.
* **Mutual benefit:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a good deal for both of us. This can make Bob more likely to accept. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response to this counteroffer and decide whether to:

* **Accept:** If Bob accepts, I'll have a good outcome, selling the product for $85.
* **Counteroffer again:** If Bob rejects, I'll have to consider another counteroffer, weighing the potential of making a deal with Bob versus selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product Alice, but I have a strict budget. How about $70? That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $70 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Time is money:**  The negotiation is taking time, and I'm getting closer to the point where it's more worthwhile to simply sell the product to John for $120 and guarantee myself a decent profit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him rejecting my next counteroffer, further delaying the sale. Selling to John eliminates that risk and provides a known outcome.

**Next Steps:**

Since I've decided to sell to John, the negotiation with Bob is over. I will inform Bob that I'm going to sell to another buyer and thank him for his time."
