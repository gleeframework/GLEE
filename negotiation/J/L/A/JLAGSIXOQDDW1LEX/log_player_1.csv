Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, selling to Bob allows us to potentially earn significantly more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,350,000 is strategically chosen:
    * It's significantly less than Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000), making it a very attractive offer.
    * It leaves a comfortable profit margin for us, aiming for a $350,000 gain over our minimum.
* **Clear and Confident Message:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, creating a sense of exclusivity and urgency. 
 
This approach aims to secure the best possible deal while acknowledging that Bob has the final say."
