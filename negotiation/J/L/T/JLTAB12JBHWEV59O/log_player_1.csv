"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm taking a gamble here. If he rejects, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe there's room for a higher price. Bob clearly sees value in the product and is willing to pay at least $1,200,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if I can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering the price to $1,300,000,  a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still trying to get a better price than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is firm on his price of $1,200,000, and I've already lowered my offer once. There's a chance he won't budge further, and I'm running out of rounds. To avoid the risk of getting stuck with my minimum price, I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,200,000. This guarantees me my minimum and ensures I don't lose out on potential profits."
