Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's above your minimum price but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more than $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price, considering the value of the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still a bit lower than I would like, but it's only $500 below my minimum.  I'm going to accept this offer, because it's better than selling to John for $12,000.  There's no guarantee I can get a better offer in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
