Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me.  I can offer $650,000. This offer reflects a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a fair deal.

We're still very far apart. Bob's offer is too low, and we have time to negotiate further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see that we're making progress. However, the gap between our valuations is still significant. To bridge this, I'm proposing $750,000. This offer represents a substantial investment on my part and demonstrates my strong interest in the product.

Bob is not moving significantly towards a price point that is acceptable.  It's becoming clear that our valuations are too far apart. It's time to cut our losses and take John's offer for a guaranteed $1,500,000."
