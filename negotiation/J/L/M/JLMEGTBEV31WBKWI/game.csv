"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, your asking price is far above my budget. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for this product.  I believe this is a fair offer considering market value.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $500,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects the immense value you'll gain from this product.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me.  I can offer $650,000. This offer reflects a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a fair deal.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still quite a ways off from a realistic price. To meet you closer to the middle, I'm willing to consider $1,700,000. This offer takes into account your feedback while still reflecting the true value of the product.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see that we're making progress. However, the gap between our valuations is still significant. To bridge this, I'm proposing $750,000. This offer represents a substantial investment on my part and demonstrates my strong interest in the product.",750000.0,Bob,6,
