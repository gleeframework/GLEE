"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something you've been looking for and I know it would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true market value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is quite high. While you'd get the product for slightly less than John's price, there's room to negotiate a better deal with Alice."
