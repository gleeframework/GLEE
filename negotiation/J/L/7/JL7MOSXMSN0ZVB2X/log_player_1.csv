Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I do like the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet somewhere in the middle? Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
