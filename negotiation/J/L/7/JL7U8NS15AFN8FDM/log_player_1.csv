"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $12,000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to come down slightly to $15,000 to make this deal work.

Bob's offer is a good compromise, and I'm confident that I can sell the product to John for $12,000 if this negotiation fails.  $13,500 is a good deal and I'm happy to take it."
