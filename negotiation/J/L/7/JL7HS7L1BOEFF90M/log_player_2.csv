Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, $1,000,000 is significantly below its worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?

You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for continuing this discussion.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but need to stay above $1,200,000. Would you be willing to finalize the deal at $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $1,200,000.  Since John will sell at that price, it's no longer beneficial to continue negotiating with Alice."
