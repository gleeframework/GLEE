**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  While $140 is still more than the product's worth to Alice ($120), it's less than what John is charging ($150).
* **You want to save money:** Your goal is to save as much as possible. Accepting Alice's offer saves you $10 compared to buying from John."
