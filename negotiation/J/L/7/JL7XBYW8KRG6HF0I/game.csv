"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it holds similar value for you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows us both to benefit.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
