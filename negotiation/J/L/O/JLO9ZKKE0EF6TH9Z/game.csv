I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $12000. Is this something you'd like to consider?,12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7000 for the product. Would you consider that?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $7000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $9500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9500 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $8500. I'm really interested in this product, and this is my final offer.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $8500 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more profit. Let's try $9200. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9200.0,Alice,5,
