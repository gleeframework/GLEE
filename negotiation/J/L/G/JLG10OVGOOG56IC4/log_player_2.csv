"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm open to offers, but I value it at least $80. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $100 is less than his maximum of $120, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price."

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $95?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```
