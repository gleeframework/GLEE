Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a great deal for a product you'll value at $10,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is key:**  We know Bob values the product at $10,000.
* **Aiming high, but realistically:**  Starting with a price of $19,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Backup plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, we're secure knowing John will buy it for $15,000. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. It assumes Bob doesn't know about John's offer. In a real-world scenario, more factors (like Bob's negotiation skills and market information) could influence the optimal approach."
