Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:**  While the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, it doesn't mean he won't pay more if he sees potential for higher returns.  The message hints at this without revealing your absolute bottom line.
* **Negotiation Room:**  This high starting price leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially settle on a price higher than $800,000. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive or dislikes aggressive negotiation, you might adjust your initial offer slightly lower.
* **Market Conditions:** If the market for this type of product is hot, you could potentially push for an even higher price."
