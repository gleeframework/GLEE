Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have significant leverage. Starting with a high offer of $1,800,000 allows room for negotiation while aiming for a much higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state Bob's $1,000,000 valuation, it emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify the high price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open for discussion, encouraging Bob to counter-offer if the initial price is too high.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing your potential profit while acknowledging the possibility of negotiation."
