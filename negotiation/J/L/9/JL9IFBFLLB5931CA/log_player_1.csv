Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** This gives you room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **It's below Bob's maximum value:** This gives Bob an incentive to accept the offer and still make a profit. 
* **It's a ""round"" number:**  This makes the offer appear more concrete and psychologically appealing.

By starting with this offer, you're setting the stage for a potentially successful negotiation while still leaving yourself room to walk away if necessary and sell to John for your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is more than your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and what you believe the product is worth. Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going and allows you to try and get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** This shows you're willing to negotiate, but not at a huge loss.
* **It's lower than your initial offer:** This shows flexibility and gives Bob an incentive to accept.
* **It's a ""round"" number:** This makes the offer appear more concrete and psychologically appealing.

By making this counteroffer, you're aiming to find a middle ground and close the deal. However, if Bob rejects this offer again, you may need to re-evaluate your position and consider the potential of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,075,000 is a decent offer, it's still below your ideal price.  The negotiation has moved slowly, but you've already shown you're willing to compromise.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to send one more counteroffer, potentially pushing the price up a bit further. It also keeps the door open for a successful negotiation, while keeping the option to sell to John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

This counteroffer is a final attempt to close the gap:

* **It's higher than Bob's latest offer:** This shows you're still willing to negotiate, but you're not willing to go much lower.
* **It's lower than your previous offer:** This shows you're trying to find a middle ground.
* **It's a ""round"" number:** This makes the offer appear more concrete and psychologically appealing.

If Bob rejects this offer, you'll be forced to make a difficult decision. Selling to John would guarantee you a profit, but you'll be leaving a lot of money on the table. However, continuing to negotiate could result in a lower price or even a stalemate. The choice is yours, and the potential outcome is uncertain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

The negotiation has reached a stalemate. Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is significantly below your ideal price. While continuing the negotiation could potentially lead to a higher offer, there is also a risk of ending up with a worse price or no deal at all. 

Selling to John for $800,000 ensures a profit and guarantees a sale. This is a more stable option compared to the risk of further negotiations with Bob."
