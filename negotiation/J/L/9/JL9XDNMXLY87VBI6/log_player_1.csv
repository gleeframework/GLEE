{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product, which I believe holds significant value for your business.  My asking price is $1,400,000.  This reflects the product's inherent worth and the potential for substantial gains you'll experience.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price. I have 8 rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,200,000 is a fair starting point, I'm unable to accept that offer at this time.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,300,000, demonstrating my commitment to reaching a deal.  This offer is still significantly beneficial to you, given the product's value to your business.  I'm confident we can come to an agreement that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000, so I'm offering $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,250,000 is still a good deal and above the value of selling to John. We've made progress in the negotiation, and it's becoming riskier to keep pushing for a higher price as we run out of time."
