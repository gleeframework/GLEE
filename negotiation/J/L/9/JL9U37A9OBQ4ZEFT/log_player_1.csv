Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price. What do you say to a price of $150?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price higher than $100 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a backup buyer guarantees at least $100, so there's an incentive to aim higher with Bob.
