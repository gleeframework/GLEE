"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  While I think the product is great,  $11,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make this product work for my needs.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $10,500, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. How about we settle on $10,800? It's a fair price that's closer to my original offer, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,800 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $10,200.  That's a fair price that's closer to my original offer, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable going below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $10,600? It's a fair price that's closer to my original offer, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",10600.0,Alice,5,
