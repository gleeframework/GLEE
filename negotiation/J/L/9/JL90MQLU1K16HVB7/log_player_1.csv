Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$115 is a reasonable starting point.** It's higher than Bob's perceived value ($100), but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and casual.**  It emphasizes the value of the product for Bob while also setting the price.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving space for Bob to negotiate. It also keeps the possibility open of selling to John if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my target price.  I can make a counteroffer that is still higher than $90 but lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility while still protecting my interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. $90 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $105?  This is a really great product, and I think it's worth it."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer:**  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Message reiterates the value of the product:**  This reinforces the idea that the product is worth the price.
* **Keeps the door open for further negotiation:**  This leaves room for Bob to make another counteroffer if needed. 

By offering $105, I'm trying to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us while still ensuring I get a reasonable price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a great product Alice, but I have a strict budget.  Could we meet in the middle at $97? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $97 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my desired outcome.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I don't want to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make another counteroffer and hopefully find a price that is closer to my target.  I also have the option of selling to John for $120, so I'm not under any pressure to accept a price that I'm not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $97 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $101?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 101}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is a slight compromise:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Message highlights fairness and mutual benefit:** This emphasizes that the offer is reasonable for both parties and emphasizes the value Bob will get from the product.
* **Maintains a firm stance:**  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not giving away the product at a price that's significantly below its value.

This counteroffer attempts to find a middle ground while still protecting my interests. It also keeps the option of selling to John for $120 open if the negotiations fall apart."
