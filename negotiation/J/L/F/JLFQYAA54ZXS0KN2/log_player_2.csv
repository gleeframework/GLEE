"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a price below its worth to you, and I get a quick and efficient sale. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and the current market."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,250,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,250,000.  It makes more sense to take the guaranteed deal from John at $1,200,000 and avoid further negotiation."
