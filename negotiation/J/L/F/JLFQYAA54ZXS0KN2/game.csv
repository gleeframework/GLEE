"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a price below its worth to you, and I get a quick and efficient sale. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and the current market.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,250,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
