"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance Alice is willing to come down, and even if not, you can always go with John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1500000 is your maximum, but I have to consider the product's value and my own costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1650000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your budget. While it's closer to your maximum, it's still not a great deal. Since you can get the product from John for a lower price, it's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,650,000 is still a bit higher than what I can afford. Given the value of the product and my budget constraints, I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000. This is a very fair price, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $1550000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1625000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above your maximum. While she's shown a willingness to negotiate, it's clear she won't come down to your desired price. Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John at $1,500,000, it's the smarter choice to secure the product at the lower price."
