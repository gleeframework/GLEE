"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $1500000? This is my maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1500000 is your maximum, but I have to consider the product's value and my own costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1650000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1650000 is still a bit higher than what I can afford. Given the value of the product and my budget constraints, I'm willing to go up to $1550000. This is a very fair price, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $1550000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1625000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1625000.0,Alice,5,
