"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $13,000. It's a one-time offer, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $13,000 saves Bob $2,000 compared to buying from John. 
* Even though the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, Alice is still making a profit by selling it to Bob for $13,000. 
* This is the best possible outcome for Bob, as he gets the product for a lower price than John's offer."
