"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it has the potential to be just as valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the product's true worth. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
