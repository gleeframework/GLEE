Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal and I think you'll be happy with it!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's valuation of the product but below your minimum.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while ensuring you still make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $90 is more than what Bob values the product at, it is still below my minimum.  I will reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $100, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is tempting, it is still below my minimum desired price of $120. I will reject Bob's offer and try one more time to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm still not able to go below $105. It's a significant discount from my original price, and it's the best I can do.  If you're truly interested, I'm willing to finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $102. I really like the product and I think it's worth it, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $102 is close to my minimum, I've reached a point where the negotiation is taking too long. John is a guaranteed sale at $120, and it's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob.  I will sell to John."
