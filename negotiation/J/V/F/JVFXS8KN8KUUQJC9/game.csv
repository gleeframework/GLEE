"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm thinking something closer to $1,000,000 would be more reasonable.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit too high for me.  How about we try $1,150,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. I can do $1,250,000, but that's as low as I can go. Let's meet in the middle at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
