Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $135 is still a fair price considering the value of the product to Bob."
