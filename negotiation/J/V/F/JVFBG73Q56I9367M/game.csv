"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. $7500 is a bit low for me, considering the value of the product.  How about we split the difference and go with $8250? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8250 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,4,
