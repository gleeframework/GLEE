"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little high for me. Would you be willing to do $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,500. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price.",8500.0,Alice,5,
