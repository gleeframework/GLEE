It's time to cut bait and go with John. Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** She's stated this is her final offer and is close to her minimum.
* **You're close to your limit:**  Even if you could negotiate Alice down another $500, it's not a significant saving compared to John's price.
* **Time is a factor:** The longer you negotiate, the more risk you have of Alice getting impatient or finding another buyer. 
 
Going with John guarantees you the product at your target price."
