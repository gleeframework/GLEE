Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob. 
* **High Starting Point:** We start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than John's offer ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Sense of Urgency & Exclusivity:** The message uses tactics like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer"" to encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially value the product higher. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** We don't know how good of a negotiator Bob is. If he's highly skilled, we might need to settle closer to his $800,000 valuation.
* **Relationship Building:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, maintaining a positive dialogue could lead to other business opportunities in the future."
