"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a fortune, and I believe it will be a game-changer for you. I'm asking for $1,200,000.  This price reflects the value and potential of this product. Let's talk! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000?  This is a reasonable compromise, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down to her absolute lowest price ($1,000,000, which is what it's worth to her).  Since you can buy the product for the same price from John without further negotiation, it makes sense to go with the guaranteed deal."
