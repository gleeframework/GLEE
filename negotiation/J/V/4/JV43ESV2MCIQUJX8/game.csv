"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a fortune, and I believe it will be a game-changer for you. I'm asking for $1,200,000.  This price reflects the value and potential of this product. Let's talk!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000?  This is a reasonable compromise, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
