"Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $150. This is the lowest I can go, but if you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",150.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $150 is still a bit above my budget, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $137.50. Can you consider this revised offer?",137.5,Bob,4,
