Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to buy the product for $10,800. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,800 is still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $10,900 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,900 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round.  I still have time and haven't reached the point where selling to John is the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to agree on a price.  I'm willing to go down to $11,200.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I'm not sure I can go any lower.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for the product. Can you consider this price?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob keeps offering the same price, and it's still not enough. I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a higher price. We've only had 6 rounds, and I'm not ready to sell to John yet.  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles here.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go any lower than $11,000. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'm going to have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 11000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is still offering a price that's too low. I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a higher price from Bob. I'm also running out of time. It's better to sell to John now and guarantee $12,000 than to keep negotiating with Bob and risk getting a lower price or no deal at all."
