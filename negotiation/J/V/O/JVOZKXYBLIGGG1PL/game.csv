"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $160. It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident I can get this product for closer to $140.  How about we split the difference and settle on $150?  Let me know if you're interested.",150.0,Bob,4,
