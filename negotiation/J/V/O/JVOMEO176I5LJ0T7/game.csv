"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its benefits to both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This reflects my commitment to finding a fair deal for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
