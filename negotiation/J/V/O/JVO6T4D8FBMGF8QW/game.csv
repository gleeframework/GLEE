"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm open to negotiation, $8,500 is a bit low for me. How about we meet at $9,000? That's a fair compromise, and it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,000. How about we meet at $8,750? I'm willing to compromise, but I want to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's meet at $8,900. This is my final offer, and it's a great deal for you considering the value of the product. If you're not willing to go any higher, I'll have to explore other options.",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $8,900 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but no higher. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll make the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",8800.0,Bob,6,
