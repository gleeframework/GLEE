Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you tailoring it to my needs. However, $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
