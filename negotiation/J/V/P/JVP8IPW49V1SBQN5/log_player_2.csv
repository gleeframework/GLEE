"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit your needs. Considering its value and the benefits it provides, I am offering it to you for $10,000. This is a special opportunity tailored just for you, given your interest and the potential it holds for your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you tailoring it to my needs. However, $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. In light of this, I am pleased to counteroffer at $9,000 for the product. This reflects a compromise that considers both the value of the product and your budget constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John. Alice has lowered her offer to $9,000, which is still more than Bob is willing to pay. Since John is offering the product for $8,000, it makes more sense for Bob to buy from John and save $1,000."
