"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a unique asset that I'm confident will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1200000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  I need to negotiate to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I can go right now.  I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it,  which is still a strong price considering my budget constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $950000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and its potential to benefit your business. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can reach a price I'm comfortable with.  While I could buy from John for $800,000, I want to see if I can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $700,000. This price is fair considering the value of the product and my budget limitations. If you're serious about making a deal, I believe this is a reasonable starting point."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to make a new offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll come down to $850000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and its potential benefits. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than my budget. However, it's getting closer. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can reach a price I'm comfortable with.  I don't want to buy from John yet because there's still a chance I can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $850,000 is still outside my budget. To make this deal work, I'm going to need to stick with my offer of $750,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my limited budget. If you're serious about selling, let's try to find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'll make one more concession and offer you a price of $825000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still $25,000 higher than my maximum. I'm willing to push for a slightly lower price, hoping to close the deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still beyond my budget. To make this deal work, I'm going to need to stick with my offer of $800,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm already at my budget limit.  If you're serious about selling, let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're at your budget limit, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to make one final concession to try to reach a deal. I'll meet you at $825000, which is the same price I offered in Round 7. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still $25,000 higher than my maximum budget. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I'm now in the 9th round, leaving very little room for further concessions. It's not guaranteed that Alice will accept my counteroffer in the next round, and even if she does, it's risky to keep pushing for a better price when I could secure the product from John for my maximum budget.  To avoid the risk of missing out entirely, I'll buy the product from John for $800,000."
