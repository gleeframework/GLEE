Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its significant worth."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, aiming higher with Bob can yield more profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,300,000 allows for a significant profit margin for Alice while still presenting an attractive discount for Bob compared to his perceived value of $1,500,000. 
* **""Exclusive Opportunity"" Framing:**  This language subtly implies scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly, making the offer more appealing."
