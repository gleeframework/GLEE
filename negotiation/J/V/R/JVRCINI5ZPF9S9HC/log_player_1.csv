Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close to $150 as possible, but you also want to make sure Bob accepts the offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $120. Offering it at $140 gives him a ""perceived deal"" â€“ he's getting it for $20 less than his valuation.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you'll at least get $150.  

By starting at $140, you leave room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer, while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum."
