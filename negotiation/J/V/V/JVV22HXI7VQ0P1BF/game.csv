"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,500,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While the product is immensely valuable at $1,300,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000? This reflects its true worth while acknowledging your investment goals.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your flexibility. Could we perhaps agree on $1,225,000? This would allow us to both reach a compromise.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you clearly recognize the immense value this product holds.  I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us, but $1,225,000 is cutting it a little too close.  How about we settle right in the middle at $1,237,500? This is my final offer.",1237500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts, Alice. Considering the product's value, I believe $1,230,000 could be a fair compromise. Let me know if this aligns with your expectations.",1230000.0,Bob,6,
