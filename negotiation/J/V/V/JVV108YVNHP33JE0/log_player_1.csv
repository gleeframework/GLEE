* I'm starting with a high offer, knowing the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. 
* I'm aiming for a good profit margin, but also leaving room for negotiation. 
* This high starting point forces Bob to reveal his true value for the product through his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**
