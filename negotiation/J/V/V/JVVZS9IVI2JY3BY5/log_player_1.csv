"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob more receptive.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to make Bob want it more. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to my $100 minimum as possible without risking a deal with John. By starting high, I can potentially get a better price while still having room to negotiate down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still lower than what I'm comfortable with. Since I have 10 rounds and the option to sell to John for $100, I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $90 is a good offer, I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this work. How about $95?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable offer:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Reinforce value and fairness:** I'm emphasizing that my offer is fair for both of us, which helps build trust and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Maintain positive tone:**  I'm staying friendly and approachable to keep the negotiation smooth.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum, but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed. I believe this is a good balance between maximizing profit and keeping the deal alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum. I still have several rounds left and the option to sell to John for $100, so I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $85 is just a bit too low for me. I'm still willing to come down a bit further. How about $90? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's budget:** I'm acknowledging his budget constraints to show empathy and understanding. 
* **Counter with a slightly lower price:** I'm offering a price that's closer to his offer but still above my minimum.
* **Emphasize fairness and closing the deal:**  I'm framing my offer as fair for both of us and a way to finalize the deal. This creates urgency and encourages him to consider the offer seriously.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a compromise that meets both of our needs. By offering a slightly lower price, I'm showing flexibility, but I'm also staying close to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $82? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering we're already close to the original price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $82 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. We've had several rounds of negotiation, and while Bob is showing interest, he's not willing to come up to my minimum. With only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk ending up with a price lower than what John is offering. It's time to take the guaranteed $100 from John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
