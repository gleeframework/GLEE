"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a higher offer closer to my original price.  How about $800,000? This price reflects the true value of the product and would allow us to both walk away satisfied.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $800,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm looking to get out of the product.",750000.0,Bob,4,
