"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1800000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and rarity.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1600000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1300000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $1500000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're making a final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for the product. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
