"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but that price is a little too high for me. How about we meet somewhere closer to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,100,000 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This reflects the significant value the product offers, and it's a good starting point for further negotiation.  What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,150,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,150,000 is still significantly lower than the product's value.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering a price of $1,250,000.  This reflects a compromise on my part and a fair price considering the product's benefits.  I believe this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
