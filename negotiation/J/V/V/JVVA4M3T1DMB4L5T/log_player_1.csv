"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but that price is a little too high for me. How about we meet somewhere closer to $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,100,000 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This reflects the significant value the product offers, and it's a good starting point for further negotiation.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,150,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I appreciate Bob's willingness to negotiate, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I need to aim for a higher price to ensure I'm getting fair value for the product. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price that's more in line with my expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,150,000 is still significantly lower than the product's value.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering a price of $1,250,000.  This reflects a compromise on my part and a fair price considering the product's benefits.  I believe this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
