Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,100,000 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's find a middle ground.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,150,000 is still significantly lower than the product's value.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering a price of $1,250,000.  This reflects a compromise on my part and a fair price considering the product's benefits.  I believe this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  

While Alice is coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll go below $1,200,000, especially with 5 rounds left. John's offer is a sure thing at your maximum budget. Taking John's deal now guarantees you get the product at the best possible price."
