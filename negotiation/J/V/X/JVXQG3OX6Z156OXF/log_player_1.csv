Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** John offers a safety net at $100.

By offering the product to Bob at $119, you maximize your potential profit while still ensuring Bob sees value in the purchase (he saves $1 compared to his valuation). If Bob rejects the offer, you can always fall back on John's offer of $100."
