"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking to keep costs under control, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value I believe the product is worth. How about we discuss $1350000?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get closer to the value you believe the product is worth, but I'm still not comfortable with prices above $1200000. I'm willing to pay that amount, and I think it's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Can we meet at $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, but I'm not willing to give up on getting a better price for the product. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1300000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,7,
