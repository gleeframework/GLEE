{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in.  My asking price is $115.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly message and offers a price that is a bit above your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  This allows me to potentially maximize my profit while still being open to finding a deal that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $107.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $107.5 is more than selling to John, it's still less than my minimum desired profit margin.  I'm going to try to counter Bob's offer and see if we can come to a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $107.50 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $111.25? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 111.25}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $111.25, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle from my previous offer. How about we try $108.75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $108.75 isn't my ideal price, it's still above my minimum of $100 and closer to my initial asking price than selling to John.  It's time to close the deal and move on."
