"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $180 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum acceptable value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Reasonable Offer:** $180 is still a good deal for Bob, considering the product is worth $80 to him. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and optimistic, encouraging Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still room for a counteroffer that could be mutually beneficial.
* **Potential for higher price:** I'm hopeful that I can reach a compromise closer to my initial offer.

**Next Round Strategy:** I will make a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $150? That's still a great price, considering what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's.
* **Minimum Acceptable:** $150 is my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal.
* **Appeal to Value:** I highlight the value of the product to Bob, emphasizing that $150 is a fair price considering his interest.
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a friendly and collaborative tone, hoping to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too low:** Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150.
* **Risk of losing out:**  While I could accept this offer and avoid further negotiation, it's a significant financial loss for me. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still a chance to negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed $150 from John, which is a safer option than taking a big loss with Bob. However, I'm not ready to give up on Bob completely just yet.

**Next Round Strategy:** I will counteroffer with a price that's slightly lower than my minimum, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'll try to find a compromise that is acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $110 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a fair price considering what you're getting. Let me know if you're interested in this final offer."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise between my minimum and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Final Offer:** I'm signaling that this is my last offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, hoping to convince him that $130 is a good deal.
* **Finality:** The message conveys a sense of finality, leaving Bob with the decision to either accept or move on.

**Next Round Strategy:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I will seriously consider selling to John for $150. I am reaching a point where the potential loss with Bob is becoming too great."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Loss:** Bob's offer of $105 is now significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150. Continuing to negotiate with him risks losing even more money.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:**  John is offering me $150, which is a guaranteed profit. This is a much safer and more financially advantageous option.
* **Time Constraint:** We are already in Round 6, meaning I have only 4 rounds left.  Further negotiation with Bob could lead to a stalemate, wasting valuable time.

**Conclusion:**  Given the situation, selling to John is the best course of action. It secures a good profit and avoids the risk of further losses through extended negotiations with Bob."
