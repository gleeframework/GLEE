"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. Can you consider my offer?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me right now.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be extremely valuable to you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,350,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1350000.0,Bob,4,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm feeling the pressure to close this deal, but $1,320,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product to you for $1,335,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value you'll gain from this product. Let's close this deal now.",1335000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,335,000. I've gone as low as I can, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'll offer you $1,325,000, and that's my final offer. If you can't meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1325000.0,Bob,10,
