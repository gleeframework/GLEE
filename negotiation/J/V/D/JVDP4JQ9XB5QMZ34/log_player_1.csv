Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its true value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that considers the following:

* **My minimum:** I need to make at least $15,000 to meet my goals, so I'm starting with a price that allows for potential negotiation.
* **Bob's value:** I know the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, so I'm offering a price that's significantly higher but leaves room for him to bargain.
* **John's offer:** I'm aware of John's offer of $15,000, so I'm not going to settle for anything less. 

By starting with a slightly higher price, I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a better deal than John's offer.  However, I'm ready to counter if Bob makes a low offer or to move on to John if the negotiation drags on."
