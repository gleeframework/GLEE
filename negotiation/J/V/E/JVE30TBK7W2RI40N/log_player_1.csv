"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly tone:**  Being friendly and engaging might make Bob more likely to consider my offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm not setting a hardline stance, leaving space for Bob to counteroffer. 

**Important Notes:**

* This is just my initial strategy. I will adapt based on Bob's response. 
* If Bob doesn't counteroffer, I'll adjust my price down in the following rounds, but only if it still feels profitable. 
*  I will also keep John's offer of $80 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount. I would like to counteroffer at $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:**  While $85 is less than my initial ask, it's still above my minimum of $80.
* **Risk of losing out:** If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and I'll be stuck with John's lower offer. 
* **Time is limited:**  We're already on round 2, and I want to avoid wasting time on further negotiation unless it's absolutely necessary. 

**By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a profitable sale while minimizing risk.**"
