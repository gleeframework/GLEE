"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something you've been looking for and I know you'd put it to good use. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what I would normally charge. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is below her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  You should always aim for the best possible deal."
