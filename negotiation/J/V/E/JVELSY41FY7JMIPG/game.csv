"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Let's start with a fair price. How about $120 for the product?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit above my budget.  Since you're willing to negotiate, I'm going to stick with my offer of $85.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",85.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $90 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $85.  This is a fair price that considers both our interests.  Let's find a way to make this work.",85.0,Bob,6,
