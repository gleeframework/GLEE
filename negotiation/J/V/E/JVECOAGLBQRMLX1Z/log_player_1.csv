"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to start with my ideal price, knowing that I can always walk away and sell to John for the same amount. This puts the pressure on Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe there's room for further negotiation and I'm not desperate to sell. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value my product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's a bit higher than his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than what I want. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000.  This is a further compromise on my part, but I still believe it's a fair price considering my minimum threshold and Bob's willingness to negotiate.  We're getting closer, and I want to see if this is enough to get Bob to finally agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. We're getting close to a deal with Bob, but I'm starting to run out of rounds. It's unlikely I'll be able to get a better price than John's offer, and I don't want to risk ending up with nothing.  I'll take the guaranteed $1,200,000."
