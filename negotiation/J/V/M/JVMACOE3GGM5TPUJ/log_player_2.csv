"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is within your budget, it's still a relatively high price.  You can likely get a better deal by counter-offering. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate further before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $90. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to find a price that's fair for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is now within my budget and represents a good compromise. It's better than going to John and paying $120. There's still room to negotiate, but the risk of Alice getting stubborn and refusing further deals makes it worthwhile to accept this offer."
