"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the starting point, but $135 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, I'm still a bit above my minimum. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $130. This is a good price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,
