"Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $12,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 just won't work for me.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to lower my price to $15,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's make this happen.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $15,000 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?  That's a fair price considering we're both trying to make a deal.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $13,500 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $14,250.  This is my final offer, and if you decline, I'll have to move on to another buyer.  Let's finalize this deal.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still at my limit.  $14,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  It's a fair price considering we're both looking for a deal.  Let's close this transaction.",14000.0,Bob,6,
