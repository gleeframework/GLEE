"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $12,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 just won't work for me.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to lower my price to $15,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $15,000 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?  That's a fair price considering we're both trying to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more. If he rejects this offer, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $13,500 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $14,250.  This is my final offer, and if you decline, I'll have to move on to another buyer.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 14250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still at my limit.  $14,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  It's a fair price considering we're both looking for a deal.  Let's close this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John for $15,000. Even though I'm close to getting a deal with Bob, I've already spent several rounds and Bob seems unwilling to budge much.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value and saves me the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob."
