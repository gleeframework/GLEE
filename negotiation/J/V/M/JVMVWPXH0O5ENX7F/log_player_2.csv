"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $7,500. It's a great deal, considering the product's worth $8,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your original price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target.  How about $7,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your target price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $7,200.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my target price, but $7,200 is still $200 above my goal. I believe there's still room for negotiation to get to a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,200 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit lower.  How about $7,100?  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 7100}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $7,150. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's the best deal you'll get. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm still $150 above my ideal price, Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate and has made a final offer.  Rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether, especially since John is offering the product for $8,000. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product for a price that's still within my budget and saves me money compared to buying from John."
