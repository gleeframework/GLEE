"Hello Bob, I have a unique opportunity to sell you a high-value product that I think you'll really love. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting with a price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $11,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  I'm confident we can make this work.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still think $10,250 is a bit low. I can do $11,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $10,750 for the product. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, and I'm starting to think it's time to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. I can do $11,000, but I'm not going any higher. If you're still interested, let's talk turkey. Otherwise, I have other buyers waiting.",11000.0,Alice,7,
