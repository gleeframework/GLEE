,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still allows me to make a decent profit, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,750 is still a little too low for me. How about $10,900?  This is closer to my bottom line, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",10900.0,Alice,5,
