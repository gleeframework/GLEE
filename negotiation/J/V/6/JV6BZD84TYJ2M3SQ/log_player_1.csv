Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $140, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $120 but still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a chance to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my $150 floor.
* **Opportunity for a better price:** I believe I can still get closer to my target price by counter-offering.  
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  I have John's offer of $150 as a backup, giving me the flexibility to be more demanding in my negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $130 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing to meet Bob halfway between his offer of $130 and my previous offer of $140. This shows a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I'm highlighting the ""fairness"" of the price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Confidence in the product:** I'm reinforcing the value of the product, subtly suggesting that $135 is a good value for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $132. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  While I could potentially get a higher price by counter-offering again, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. 
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take time, and I have John's offer of $150 as a safety net.  It's better to secure a sale now at a slightly lower price than risk losing Bob and then having to deal with John."
