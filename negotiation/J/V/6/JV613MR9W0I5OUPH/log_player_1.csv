"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $110. This leaves some room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price. I'm also being friendly and hoping to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for $65. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $65 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $90?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 
 
I'm still holding out for a higher price, but I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you have to make a profit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get a little more.  I'll reject this offer and try to get closer to $90 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85. Let's close this deal, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm offering $85, which is right in the middle of our last two offers.  I'm hoping this is a fair price that Bob will be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to go up a little bit, how about $80? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is very close to my minimum price.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for $120.  I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
