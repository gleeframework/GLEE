"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think that's the highest I can go.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but this product is truly exceptional, and I'm confident it's worth more.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  Let's make this happen!",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000, which would be $975,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum. It's a significant investment, but I believe this product will deliver exceptional value for you.  Let's close this deal!",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to go up to $995,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again.",995000.0,Bob,6,
