Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it!  I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($120) to give him some room to negotiate. This increases the chances of him accepting the initial offer.
* **Potential Profit:** This price still gives me a profit above my minimum ($150) while leaving room to potentially negotiate further.
* **Keeping John in Mind:** While $150 from John is a guaranteed profit, there's a chance I can get more from Bob, so I'll try to negotiate further before resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice,  I appreciate you offering the product, but $135 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $125? I'm really interested in getting this, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $125 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  While $125 is better than nothing, I believe I can potentially get closer to my minimum price by continuing the negotiation with Bob.  
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John guarantees $150, but I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $125 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  I'm confident you'll be happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows flexibility while still trying to get a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Middle Ground:**  $130 is a middle ground between my previous offer of $135 and Bob's offer of $125. 
* **Maintaining Profit:**  This price still ensures a profit above my minimum requirement."
