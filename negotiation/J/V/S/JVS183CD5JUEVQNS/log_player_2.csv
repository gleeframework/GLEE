"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it!  I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $120 to you, so it makes sense to try and negotiate a better price with Alice before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice,  I appreciate you offering the product, but $135 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $125? I'm really interested in getting this, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $125 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  I'm confident you'll be happy with this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's offer is $130, which is still more than the $120 I'm willing to pay. Since I can get the product for my desired price from John, it's better to buy it from him rather than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
