"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that's still within Bob's potential value range.  This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, but also demonstrates my willingness to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a good amount, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,200,000.  I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

I'm offering $1,050,000. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still leaving room for more negotiation. It also shows Bob I'm serious about closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While the offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not at the point where it's worth risking a deal with John for a guaranteed $1,200,000. I'll counteroffer again to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm going to drop my counteroffer to $1,000,000. This is still a significant amount of money, and hopefully, Bob will see it as a fair compromise.  I want to close this deal but need to make sure I'm not selling myself short."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm running out of time. It's clear that he's not going to meet my minimum price.  I'm better off selling to John and securing the guaranteed $1,200,000."
