"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. It's better to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down to a more reasonable price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $7,000?"", 
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiations often benefit from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is respectful while clearly stating that the initial offer is unacceptable and proposing a significantly lower price point. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help understand how much Alice is willing to move on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,200. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still above John's offer. There's room for further negotiation. We're getting closer to a potential deal, but it's worth seeing if we can get closer to $8,000 before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,600?  That feels like a fair deal to me."", 
""product_price"": 7600
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  This counteroffer shows willingness to move towards Alice's price while still aiming for a significant discount.
* **Seeking Compromise:** By proposing a price directly in the middle of the previous offers, it signals a desire to find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Time Constraint:**  As rounds progress, the risk of reaching no agreement increases. Offering a price closer to Alice's asking price acknowledges the need to make progress."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,600. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,100. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that $8,100 is her bottom line.  While it's close to her value, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. John's offer of $8,000 is guaranteed and saves us money in the long run. It's time to cut our losses and go with the sure thing."
