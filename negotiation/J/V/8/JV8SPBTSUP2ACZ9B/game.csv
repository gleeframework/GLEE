"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,200. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,600?  That feels like a fair deal to me.",7600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a fair deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,600. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,100. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",8100.0,Alice,5,
