I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's exceptional features and benefits. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $1050000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to my initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value while also being reasonable for your budget. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for increasing your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I still need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my initial price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1150000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope it's acceptable to you. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. However, I still feel that the product's value is worth more than your last offer. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000, which is the same price I initially offered. If this is still not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1175000, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for the product. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find common ground. However, I'm getting close to my minimum price, and I need to be careful. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Alice,9,

,,Alice,10,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're willing to go up to $1187500, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for the product. I've already made several concessions, and I'm getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find common ground, but I need to be careful. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling the product to John for $800000, which would be a significant loss for me. I hope you understand my position.",1200000.0,Alice,11,

"I'm disappointed that we're not able to meet at a price, Bob. I've made several concessions, and I'm getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find common ground, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000, and that's my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to John for $800000, which would be a significant loss for me. I hope you understand my position.",1200000.0,Alice,13,
