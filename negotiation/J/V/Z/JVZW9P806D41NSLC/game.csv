"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway once, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'll give you a slight concession and offer it to you for $11500. This is my final offer on the high end.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm surprised you're willing to walk away from this deal. I'm not willing to sell it to you for $9000, as it's below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me in the middle. I'll sell it to you for $10000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,7,
