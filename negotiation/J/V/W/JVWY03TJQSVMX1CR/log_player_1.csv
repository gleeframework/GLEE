Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its true value to you. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000:** This price is a good starting point as it's a significant profit for me while still leaving room for negotiation with Bob. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, making it more likely he'll engage in further discussion. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** Starting with a high price allows for potential negotiation down to a mutually agreeable price point that still yields a significant profit.
* **Keep the negotiation open:** The message focuses on collaboration, which can encourage Bob to counteroffer rather than immediately reject, allowing for a more dynamic negotiation.
* **Provide a safety net:**  If Bob is unwilling to negotiate, I can always sell to John for $800,000, ensuring I don't lose out on a substantial amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Considering your value for the product and my maximum budget, I'd like to offer you $900000. This price is fair to both of us and allows for a smooth transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still a very good deal for me.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,000,000, accepting his offer:

* **Secures a significant profit:**  $900,000 is well above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Avoids potential risks:** Continuing the negotiation with Bob might lead to a lower price or even a stalemate.  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale at a profitable price.
* **Reduces transaction costs:**  Further negotiation takes time and effort.  Accepting now minimizes those costs. 

It's a good balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk."
