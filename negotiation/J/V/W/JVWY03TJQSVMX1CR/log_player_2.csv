"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1000000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its true value to you. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good start, but you can likely get a better deal. You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice values the product at $800,000.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you open the door to a counteroffer that might get you closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Considering your value for the product and my maximum budget, I'd like to offer you $900,000. This price is fair to both of us and allows for a smooth transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
