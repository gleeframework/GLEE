{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so this offer leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum value:** You're willing to accept $1,500,000, so this offer gives you room to compromise. 
* **It shows confidence:** You're not starting at a drastically high number, indicating you're serious about selling to Bob.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also to be flexible and potentially reach an agreement with Bob."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $1,100,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum price. I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a higher price to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."

Bob's offer:

While I want to close the deal, $1,050,000 is still too low for me. It's closer to my minimum, but I need to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject this offer and make a final counteroffer to see if we can agree."
