"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it still costs more than Bob is willing to pay.  Bob would be better off rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $100, as this is still within his budget."
