Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's valuation of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize the ""great deal"" for Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end with a clear invitation for Bob to respond, setting the stage for a back-and-forth exchange.

This approach aims to secure a price closer to my desired $1,500,000 while also being open to negotiation. I'm ready to adjust my offer based on Bob's response, but I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't reach a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant improvement from Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me.  

I'll proceed to the next round and counter with a price closer to my desired range.  This will allow me to further gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which reflects the value of this product and offers you a good price. Let's meet in the middle, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate while staying firm on my minimum price.
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize the mutual benefit of the deal, suggesting a ""happy"" outcome for both of us.
* **Middle Ground:** I explicitly suggest finding a ""middle ground,"" hinting at a potential final agreement that benefits both parties. 

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while still safeguarding my interests. I'm prepared to continue negotiating, but I'm also ready to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't show a willingness to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $950,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his offer of $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob at this point would likely lead to further concessions from me, potentially resulting in a loss for me.

Selling to John at $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum desired price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.  It's the most advantageous option for me at this point."
