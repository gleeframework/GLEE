# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product! I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm willing to part with it for a price of $950,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is below your maximum budget, you can potentially get a better deal. John offers the product for $1,200,000, but there's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or see if John is open to a price closer to your desired range."
