"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1200000. I would like to propose an alternative that respects both our positions. How about we aim for a price closer to $950000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but given my financial situation, I am unable to meet the price of $1100000.

This seems to be a reasonable midpoint between our positions, allowing us to move forward with a mutually beneficial transaction.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
