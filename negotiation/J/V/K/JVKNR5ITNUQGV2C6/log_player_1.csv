Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's high enough that I'm still getting a significant profit, but low enough that it might incentivize Bob to negotiate rather than walk away. I'm confident that Bob will want the product, and I'm willing to negotiate a bit to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my ideal price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's too low. I'll send a counteroffer and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  I'm confident that a price in this range is fair, considering both our desired outcomes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get a little bit more. I'll send a counteroffer and see if we can finalize a deal."

I'm coming down to $1,100,000, which is right in the middle of our last two offers. This shows a strong desire to close the deal while still ensuring I get a profit significantly higher than what John would offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

```

Bob's offer is now too low for me.  While I'd prefer to get more, selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures I reach my minimum goal and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
