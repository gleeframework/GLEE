(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a significantly lower price than John's offer, minimizing risk and maximizing savings."
