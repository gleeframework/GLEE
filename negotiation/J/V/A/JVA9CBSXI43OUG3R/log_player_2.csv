"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $130.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $150 to you and Alice is asking for $130. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $115?  I think that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go down to $115. Could you do $125? That's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $125 is a good deal for me. It's still below my maximum of $150, and closer to my desired price.  I'll accept the offer."
