Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in my product. While your offer is lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This price still allows you a considerable profit, considering the value you've placed on the product. Let's reach an agreement that benefits both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $700,000 is simply too low. This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be worth much more to you in the long run. To show my willingness to work with you, I'm offering a price of $1,000,000.  This gives you a substantial margin for profit while still allowing me to achieve a fair price. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is coming down in price, she's still significantly over John's offer. At this point, it's unlikely she'll go as low as $800,000.  It makes more sense to cut your losses and secure the product from John at your target price."
