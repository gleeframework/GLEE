"Alice, that price is way too high. I'm interested in the product, but it needs to be a reasonable price.  I'm willing to offer $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in my product. While your offer is lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This price still allows you a considerable profit, considering the value you've placed on the product. Let's reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but that's still a big gap. I can go up to $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $700,000 is simply too low. This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be worth much more to you in the long run. To show my willingness to work with you, I'm offering a price of $1,000,000.  This gives you a substantial margin for profit while still allowing me to achieve a fair price. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
