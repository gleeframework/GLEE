"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional returns.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that price. How about we bring it down to a more reasonable $600,000?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,300,000. This reflects the product's inherent value while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit closer to a reasonable price.  However, to be realistic, we need to be much closer to the $600,000 range I proposed. I'm willing to offer $700,000 to keep things moving, but that's as high as I can go at this point."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your current offer doesn't reflect the value this product offers. I'm willing to make a significant move to $1,000,000, but this is my final offer.  It's a fair price considering the potential returns you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly in price, but her ""final offer"" of $1,000,000 is still higher than your maximum budget and John's offer.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and you risk her sticking to this price.  Buying from John guarantees you get the product within your budget and avoids further negotiation."
