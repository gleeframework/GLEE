"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional returns."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired selling price. This allows room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land closer to your target.
* **Justifying the Price:** By mentioning the ""incredible value and potential"" and ""exceptional returns,"" we aim to frame the product in a positive light and subtly justify the high asking price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and our minimum, leaving ample room for negotiation and counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that price. How about we bring it down to a more reasonable $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both our minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and his own perceived value ($800,000). Accepting would be a substantial loss. We have the guaranteed option of selling to John for $1,000,000, but there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,300,000. This reflects the product's inherent value while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Flexibility:** We are significantly reducing our initial asking price, showing Bob we are willing to negotiate.
* **Still Above Bob's Value:** The new price is still substantially above Bob's perceived value, giving us room to go lower while aiming for a price above our minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** We're continuing to emphasize the product's value to justify the relatively high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit closer to a reasonable price.  However, to be realistic, we need to be much closer to the $600,000 range I proposed. I'm willing to offer $700,000 to keep things moving, but that's as high as I can go at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is increasing, $700,000 is still significantly less than our $1,000,000 minimum.  We need to signal that he's not even close to a reasonable range. We risk losing a deal with Bob, but we have the safety net of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your current offer doesn't reflect the value this product offers. I'm willing to make a significant move to $1,000,000, but this is my final offer.  It's a fair price considering the potential returns you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're making it clear that this is our bottom line and we won't go any lower.
* **Justification:** By calling it ""fair"" and highlighting ""potential returns,"" we're subtly anchoring the price to Bob's potential gains.
* **Time Constraint:**  By round 5, we're nearing the halfway point. Putting forth our minimum acceptable price now creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision."
