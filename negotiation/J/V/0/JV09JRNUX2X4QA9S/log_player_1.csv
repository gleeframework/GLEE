"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold opening that sets a high expectation and gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I don't know what Bob's budget is, so I'm taking a gamble to see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer** and proceed to the next round. While $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with a price of $900,000. This is a significant step down from my initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation. I'm hoping that Bob is willing to meet me halfway to secure the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer** again.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I still have several rounds to negotiate. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a few more counteroffers.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I'm optimistic that I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm offering $850,000 as my counteroffer.  This is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's latest offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on. I'm getting closer to my minimum price, and I believe this offer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate fairly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer**.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to sell for that price yet. I have several rounds left and I'm confident that I can secure a better deal with continued negotiation.  I'm still holding out for a higher price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum price of $800,000. This is a significant compromise on my part and leaves me with no room for further negotiation. However, I still have a few rounds left and I'm hoping that Bob will finally accept this offer. If he rejects again, I will have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to **sell the product to John for $800,000**.  Bob's offer is getting increasingly low and I'm running out of rounds. While I hoped to secure a better deal, I'm happy to accept John's offer and avoid the risk of a lower price or a deal falling through."
