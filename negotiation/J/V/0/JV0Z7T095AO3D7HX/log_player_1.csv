Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is designed to maximize my profits while still being attractive to Bob. Here's why:

* **Higher than John's offer:** $1,400,000 is significantly more than what I would get from John, ensuring a much higher return.
* **Lower than Bob's value:**  $1,400,000 is still less than what the product is worth to Bob ($1,500,000), making it a good deal for him. 

This strategy increases my chances of Bob accepting the offer while securing a substantial profit."
