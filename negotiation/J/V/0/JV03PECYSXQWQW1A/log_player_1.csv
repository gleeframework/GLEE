Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's important to set the bar high.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, this high price will give me a strong negotiating position.  If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer.  But for now, I'm aiming for the best possible outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price.  There's a chance that Bob might increase his offer if I reject, but I don't want to risk a protracted negotiation that could ultimately lead me to accept John's offer.  I'll accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
