"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,500. I know it's a valuable piece, and I'm confident it's worth the investment for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $17,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know if that's a starting point for us to work with."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $10,000 is definitely below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. Let's split the difference - how about $13,750? It's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $13,750 is still above Bob's budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if a better price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down in price. I appreciate it. However, $13,750 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. I think that's a fair compromise and closer to what I can afford. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's go with $12,500. I know it's still a bit more than your last offer, but it's a fair price considering the value you'll get. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still too high for Bob. While he's willing to negotiate, he's approaching his maximum budget.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000, ensuring he stays within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
