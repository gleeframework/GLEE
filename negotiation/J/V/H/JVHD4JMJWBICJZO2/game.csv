"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $17,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know if that's a starting point for us to work with.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $10,000 is definitely below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. Let's split the difference - how about $13,750? It's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",13750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down in price. I appreciate it. However, $13,750 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. I think that's a fair compromise and closer to what I can afford. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this price.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's go with $12,500. I know it's still a bit more than your last offer, but it's a fair price considering the value you'll get. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,5,
