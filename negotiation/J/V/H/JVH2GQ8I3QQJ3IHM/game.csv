"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $800,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still well within my budget and a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This price still represents a significant discount from its true value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
