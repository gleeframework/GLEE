"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $700,000 is simply too low for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  $750,000 is still a bit below my desired price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $825,000?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.  Let me know what you think.",825000.0,Alice,5,
