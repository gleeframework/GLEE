"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value significantly exceeds that price point. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This offer reflects the true worth of the product.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I need to find a price that works for both of us. Could we possibly meet in the middle somewhere around $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $760,000 is still below my target, I'm willing to consider $890,000 as a compromise to finalize the deal quickly.",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $890,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we split the difference and settle at $805,000?",805000.0,Bob,6,
