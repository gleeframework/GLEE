Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $890,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we split the difference and settle at $805,000?

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is below Alice's initial target, it's crucial to consider the following:

* **Time Constraint:**  Six rounds have passed, leaving only four more to potentially reach a better deal.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a strong interest in the product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a much higher price risks losing Bob entirely. Accepting $805,000 guarantees a significant profit over Bob's initial offers.

It's a strategic decision to accept a less-than-ideal offer to secure a deal within the time constraint and avoid the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
