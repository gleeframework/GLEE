"Bob, I understand your desire to save money, but $8500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my desired price. How about $9500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still be able to make a good profit.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your desired price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $9000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
