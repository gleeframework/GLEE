Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $14,000, which reflects its true value."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While starting high, offering it at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit, while still securing a great deal for Alice.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Going straight for the full $15,000 might make Bob feel like he's not getting a good deal and could lead to him rejecting the offer outright. 

This strategy aims to balance getting the best price from Bob while still ensuring the sale goes through."
