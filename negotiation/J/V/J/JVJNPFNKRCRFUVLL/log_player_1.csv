{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $110 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  He's getting closer, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $112.50 yet. I think I can get a little more if I keep negotiating."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are getting close to my floor price, but I don't think I can get much higher than $112.75. I've got John lined up to buy for $120, so it makes more sense to just sell to him at this point."
