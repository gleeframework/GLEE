"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable amount ($1,500,000). This allows room for negotiation and signals the product's value to you.
* **Aiming High:**  While Bob values the product at $1,000,000, he might be willing to pay more if he perceives it as essential or if there's a scarcity factor.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high initial price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""fair starting point for negotiations"" explicitly indicates a willingness to discuss the price further.

By starting high, Alice establishes a strong position and can gauge Bob's interest level based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still a considerable gap between their valuations, but it's too early to walk away.  Alice can use the remaining rounds to negotiate a better deal. 
* **John as Backup:** Alice has the security of John's offer, ensuring she won't be forced to accept a price below her minimum.

By rejecting Bob's offer, Alice signals that she's serious about negotiating a fair price while keeping the door open for further discussion."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but your offer is considerably below the product's true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:**  Starting with ""I appreciate your interest"" maintains a positive tone despite the rejected offer.
* **Standing Firm:**  Alice reiterates that Bob's offer is too low, reinforcing her position.
* **Significant Concession:**  Dropping from $2,250,000 to $1,800,000 is a large step, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":**  This framing makes the offer seem more appealing, even though it's still significantly above Bob's valuation.

This counteroffer aims to find a balance between demonstrating flexibility while still pushing for a price much closer to Alice's target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to find some common ground. While I believe the product has value, $1,800,000 is still far too high. I can go up to $950,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** Bob's offer of $950,000 remains significantly below Alice's $1,500,000 minimum. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.
* **Slow Progress:** Bob's incremental increases suggest he might be willing to go higher, but at this rate, an agreement within 10 rounds seems unlikely. 
* **John as Leverage:**  The safety net of John's offer allows Alice to apply pressure and maintain a firm stance in the negotiation.

Alice needs to signal that Bob's offers are not meeting her expectations while still encouraging him to make a more serious proposal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're trying to find common ground, but your offer needs to reflect the value this product brings. I'm willing to drop to $1,600,000, but that's my final concession for now. This offer stands for this round only, as I have other potential buyers to consider."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** The message acknowledges Bob's efforts while clearly stating that his offer is insufficient.
* **Strategic Concession:** A $200,000 reduction is significant but keeps the price well above Bob's current offer and Alice's minimum. 
* **Introducing Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other potential buyers"" and a limited-time offer adds pressure for Bob to make a serious move.
* **Final Concession (for now):** This phrase implies potential flexibility later in the negotiation but signals that Bob needs to significantly improve his offer to keep the discussion going.

This counteroffer aims to push Bob towards a more realistic price by combining a reasonable concession with a sense of urgency and the possibility of losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, that price is still outside my budget.  I can do $1,000,000, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a fair offer considering I have another option available. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Bob has explicitly stated that $1,000,000 is his ""absolute limit.""  His mention of another option indicates he's unlikely to go higher.
* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:** Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of him walking away or further lowballing.  Even if Alice manages to get slightly more than $1,000,000, the potential gain is small compared to the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.
* **Time Factor:**  Five rounds have passed with limited progress.  There's a real chance of wasting valuable time with Bob, especially if he's using delaying tactics. 

While Alice could potentially squeeze out a bit more from Bob, the certainty of John's offer and the minimal potential upside make selling to John the most logical and profitable decision."
