"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but your offer is considerably below the product's true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we need to find some common ground. While I believe the product has value, $1,800,000 is still far too high. I can go up to $950,000. Let me know if that works for you.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're trying to find common ground, but your offer needs to reflect the value this product brings. I'm willing to drop to $1,600,000, but that's my final concession for now. This offer stands for this round only, as I have other potential buyers to consider.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, that price is still outside my budget.  I can do $1,000,000, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a fair offer considering I have another option available.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
