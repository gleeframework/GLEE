"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $1,350,000. This offer reflects the product's worth and is a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,350,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit hesitant.  Would you be open to $1,100,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the right price, and I want to make a deal that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This is my final offer.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
