"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm only willing to pay $80 for this product. Would you be willing to come down a bit?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $115?  I'm confident you'll still find this a good deal. ",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $95 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $105?  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $98, but that's my absolute final offer.  If you're not willing to come down to that price, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",98.0,Bob,6,
