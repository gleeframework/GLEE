Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're starting with a price that's higher than your minimum, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's not too high:** Starting with a price that's too high might make Bob immediately reject the offer and move on.
* **It includes a positive message:** It's always good to be polite and positive when negotiating.

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm only willing to pay $80 for this product. Would you be willing to come down a bit? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than your minimum price of $100.  It's not worth selling the product to him at that price.  You're better off either trying to negotiate a higher price or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $115?  I'm confident you'll still find this a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  This counter-offer is a compromise. You've moved closer to Bob's price, but you're still above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Message:** You've kept the message friendly and positive. 
* **Reasoning:** By splitting the difference, you're showing that you're willing to negotiate but you're also not willing to accept a price too far below your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is closer to your minimum price of $100, it's still not quite there.  Given that you have the option to sell to John for $100, it makes more sense to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $95 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $105?  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm increasing the price a little, but still below what John is offering. This shows I'm flexible but also committed to a price that is close to my minimum.
* **Positive Message:** I'm remaining polite and focusing on finding a solution that works for both of us.
* **Reasoning:**  This counter-offer is a compromise. It's closer to Bob's price, but still above my minimum. It demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate but also have a limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $98, but that's my absolute final offer.  If you're not willing to come down to that price, I'm going to have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $98 is still below your minimum price of $100. While it's tempting to try to squeeze out just a few more dollars, John is offering a guaranteed $100. It's not worth risking losing the sale for a small difference in price.  Selling to John is the most financially secure option."
