Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice. $110 is a bit too close to my maximum budget."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go. The product is really worth more than that to me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.

While $105 is better, I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll try one more time to get a bit closer to $90."

Alice seems firm on her price, and $108 is a reasonable compromise. It's better to accept this than risk the negotiations breaking down and having to pay John's higher price."
