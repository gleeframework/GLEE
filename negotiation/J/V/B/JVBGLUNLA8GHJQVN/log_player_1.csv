Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be worth at least $10,000 to you. To secure your purchase, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. This is a unique chance to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start high.  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the higher price. 
* **Confident Tone:**  A confident tone can influence Bob's perception of the product's worth.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is very price-sensitive, you might slightly lower your initial offer.
* **Negotiation Skills:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters your offer. You have a $5,000 buffer (between your asking price and John's offer) to work with."
