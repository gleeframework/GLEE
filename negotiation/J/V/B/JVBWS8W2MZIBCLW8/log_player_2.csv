{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, it's still more than what the product is worth to you ($150). It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $110? I'm really interested in this product."", ""product_price"": 110}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $125 is still higher than what the product is worth to me ($150).  While it's tempting to accept, it's worth trying to negotiate further to see if we can get closer to my target price.  I still have some room to maneuver before having to consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit too high.  How about $115?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I need to make a bit more profit on this sale. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my ideal price, $130 is still more than I want to spend.  I'm determined to see if I can negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John.  I still have 5 rounds left, so I can continue to bargain."
