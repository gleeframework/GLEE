"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,200,000. This is a significant amount less than what the product is worth to Bob, but it's still a hefty profit for me.  I believe this will motivate Bob to negotiate without immediately resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a good price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with some further negotiation. I want to see if I can push him higher before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still a good profit margin for me. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable price and be willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is a good deal, I'm not yet ready to settle. I want to see if I can squeeze out another $50,000 or so before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is a further compromise, but I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's initial willingness to pay $1,500,000. It's also getting closer to my goal and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  We're now very close to my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing this deal by continuing to push for a slightly higher amount. At this point, the potential loss of $25,000 outweighs the chance of gaining another $25,000."
