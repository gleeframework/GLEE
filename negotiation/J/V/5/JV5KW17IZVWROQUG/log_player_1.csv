Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Balance:** This price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still attractive enough compared to your backup offer from John.

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might reject this offer, knowing you have another buyer. However, it's a calculated risk to potentially earn an extra $150,000."
