Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a decent markup from my minimum value of $120, giving me some room to negotiate if necessary. I'm hoping Bob sees value in the product and is willing to pay this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still higher than my minimum of $120, but I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering $140, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $135 is close to my initial offer of $140, and I'm willing to accept it. It's a good price and I'm not sure if I can get a better offer from him in the next round."
