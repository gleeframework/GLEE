Alice's offer:

# Alice's message: I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. It's a compromise, but I believe it's the best we can do at this point.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to come down further and we risk losing the opportunity to buy from John at $1,000,000.  It's better to secure the product at the best price we know is available."
