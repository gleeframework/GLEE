"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. Let's meet in the middle.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $85. Can we meet in the middle at $87.50?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $87.50 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90, but that's my final offer. I'm starting to think about buying from John for $80, so I hope we can meet at that price.",90.0,Bob,6,
