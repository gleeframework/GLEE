Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  The phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies that the product is worth the higher price.
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning you'll list it publicly (and implicitly, to John) creates a sense of urgency and scarcity. Bob might be more inclined to accept if he thinks he could lose the opportunity. 
* **Polite and Open:**  The tone is important. Being polite and asking for Bob's thoughts encourages a positive negotiation. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged."
