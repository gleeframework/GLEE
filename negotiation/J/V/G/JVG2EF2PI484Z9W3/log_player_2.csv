{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While the product is attractive,  $1,350,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial constraints. "", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within budget:** Bob's counteroffer of $1,250,000 is still below his maximum budget of $1,200,000.  This shows he is serious about buying but also willing to negotiate.
* **Reasonable starting point:** It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer but still reflects the product's potential value. 
* **Open communication:** The message is polite and explains Bob's reasoning, setting the stage for a constructive negotiation."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for adjusting your offer.  While it's closer, $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget. To make this deal work, I can only go up to $1,275,000.  This represents a significant compromise for me, and I truly believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
