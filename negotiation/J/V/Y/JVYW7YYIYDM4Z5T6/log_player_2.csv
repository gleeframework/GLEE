"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product from John for $120, which is lower than Alice's offer of $130.  Since you are trying to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option."
