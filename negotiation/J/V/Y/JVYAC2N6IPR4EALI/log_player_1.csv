"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000). This gives me room to negotiate and allows me to potentially earn closer to my minimum value ($15,000).
* **Friendly tone:** The message is friendly and conveys confidence in the product's value. This creates a more positive negotiation atmosphere. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By starting with $14,000, I leave some room for Bob to counteroffer without completely rejecting the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $12,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** Even though Bob's offer is low, we're still in the early stages of negotiation, and I have more rounds to try and reach a more favorable price.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can potentially negotiate a higher price in the next round, possibly closer to my desired $15,000.
* **Selling to John is an option:**  While I'd prefer to get a better deal with Bob, I have the option to sell to John for my minimum price if the negotiation doesn't work out."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your interest, $12,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $14,000 to make this work. Let's meet in the middle, I'm offering $13,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget and making a slight concession by lowering my price from $14,000 to $13,500. 
* **Maintaining value:** $13,500 is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and is closer to my desired price.
* **Emphasize mutual benefit:**  The message emphasizes that finding a middle ground is beneficial for both of us. 
* **Staying flexible:**  By offering $13,500, I leave room for further negotiation if necessary, without completely closing the door on a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a lower offer of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make it work within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** Even though Bob is showing interest, his offer of $12,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **More rounds left:** With four rounds remaining, I have time to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I can still try to raise Bob's offer closer to my desired price in the following rounds.
* **John is a safe option:** If I fail to reach an agreement with Bob, I have the option to sell to John for my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose out on a profitable sale."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can't go below $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm continuing to make concessions but sticking to a price above my minimum. This shows I'm flexible while still protecting my interests.
* **Highlight value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to see the worth of my offer.
* **Emphasize fairness:** I'm framing my offer as a ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and increase the chances of acceptance.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By offering $13,000, I leave room for further negotiation in case Bob counters again, but I'm not drastically lowering my price.
* **Time pressure:** We are halfway through the negotiation, so I am starting to increase the pressure slightly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,750, but no higher. I really think that's the maximum I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,750 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited time:** With only four rounds left, time is becoming a factor, but I still believe there is potential to get closer to my desired price. 
* **John is a safe option:** I know I can always sell to John for $15,000, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob. 
* **Possible counteroffer:**  I'm confident that by rejecting Bob's offer, I can potentially make a counteroffer closer to my minimum and potentially close the deal with Bob.

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer, hoping I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial situation, but $12,750 just doesn't work for me.  I'm really close to selling to another buyer who's offering me $15,000.  To show you I'm serious about making this work, I'll come down to $13,250.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Emphasize urgency:**  I'm highlighting the pressure from another buyer to encourage Bob to take my offer seriously.
* **Final offer:** I'm making it clear this is my last counteroffer, emphasizing that this is the best price Bob will get from me.
* **Fair price:** I'm framing it as a fair price for both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Concessions:** I've lowered my price to $13,250, making a significant concession to show my willingness to compromise.
* **Minimizing risk:**  By making a final offer, I'm minimizing the risk of further negotiation and potentially reaching a deal with Bob before time runs out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm afraid I still can't go above $12,750. I really appreciate your time and effort, but I think that's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds left, the odds of successfully negotiating a higher price with Bob are slim.
* **Bob's stubbornness:**  Bob has repeatedly refused to budge from his offer of $12,750, indicating he's unlikely to change his mind.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer.

While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob, the risk of wasting the remaining rounds and ending up with a lower price is too high. Selling to John ensures I get the best possible outcome at this point in the negotiation."
