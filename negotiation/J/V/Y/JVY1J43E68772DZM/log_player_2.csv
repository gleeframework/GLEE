"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You are willing to pay up to $150, and Alice's offer is above your ideal price point. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you thinking of me. While I do see the value in the product, $120 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $100 wouldn't quite cover my costs.  How about we split the difference at $110?  It's a fair compromise that still gives you a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $110 is still a good deal for you. It's well within your budget and a better price than John's offer. It's a fair compromise, so you should accept it."
