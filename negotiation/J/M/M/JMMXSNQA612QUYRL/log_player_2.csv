Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us.  If you're still not able to go higher, I'll have to accept your previous offer of $8,500, but I'd prefer to find a solution that works for us both.
