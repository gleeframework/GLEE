"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider this price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I can't go as low as $8,000.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm still unable to meet at $9,000. I would like to propose $8,500 as my maximum offer.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us.  If you're still not able to go higher, I'll have to accept your previous offer of $8,500, but I'd prefer to find a solution that works for us both.",8750.0,Alice,5,
