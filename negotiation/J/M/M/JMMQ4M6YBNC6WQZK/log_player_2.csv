"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product for a price that's lower than its worth to you, and I get a strong return on my investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** You're getting a good deal, but you can likely do better.
* **You have room to negotiate.** You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $800,000.  There's a significant gap to work with.
* **Rejecting allows for counter-offers.** By rejecting, you can explore if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer you $900,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something closer to my initial price. How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? This still leaves you with a great deal, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is reasonable.**  It's a good compromise, splitting the difference between your last offer and her previous one.
* **You're still saving a significant amount.** You're getting the product for $950,000, which is $250,000 less than what you'd pay John.
* **Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal.**  Alice might not be willing to go lower, and you risk getting stuck paying John's higher price."
