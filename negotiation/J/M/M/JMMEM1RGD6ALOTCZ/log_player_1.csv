I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary while still securing a profit above my minimum threshold.  Let's see what Bob's reaction is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer meets my minimum price, I'm not comfortable accepting it right away.  I believe the product is worth more and I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm countering with a price of $1,300,000. This is a compromise,  showing  willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  Let's see if this is acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for my liking.  While I'd prefer to close the deal with him, I'm not willing to go below $1,200,000.  To ensure I secure my minimum profit, I'll sell the product to John."
