"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value while allowing us to reach a fair agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our continued negotiation, $1,050,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,150,000 to reflect your interest and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. This price still provides me with a fair return, and it's closer to a figure I believe we can both be happy with. Please consider my counteroffer.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
