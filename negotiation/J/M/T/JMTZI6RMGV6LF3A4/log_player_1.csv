Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,300,000 represents a fair starting point considering its potential, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we meet at $1,100,000? This reflects a significant reduction on my end while still acknowledging the inherent worth of what's being offered."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still above my maximum budget. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,000,000 mark I need. John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price. It makes more sense to secure the sure profit now."
