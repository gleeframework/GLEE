Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that could significantly enhance your business operations.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, the price is a bit higher than I had in mind. I'm interested in the product, but  $15,000 is not feasible for me. Would you consider a price closer to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

I hope this proposal works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
