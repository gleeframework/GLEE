"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $130 is better than $150, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $115 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** The product is worth $150 to Bob, and Alice is now offering it for $125. This is a good deal for Bob, as he is saving $25 compared to buying from John.
* **Negotiation:**  While Bob could continue negotiating, the difference between $125 and $115 is only $10. It's unlikely Alice will go lower. 
* **Risk:** Continuing to negotiate risks running out of rounds and having to buy at the higher price from John. 

By accepting the offer, Bob secures the product at a good price with minimal risk."
