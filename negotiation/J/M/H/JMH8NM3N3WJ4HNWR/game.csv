"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is quite high though. This product would be valuable to me, but I'd need to be much closer to $700,000 to make it work.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but that price undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber. What do you say?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart.  While I appreciate you coming down, the gap between our positions is too large.  To be frank, anything above $800,000 isn't going to be feasible for me.  I'd be willing to move up slightly from my previous offer if you can meet me closer to that range.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget limitations. However, I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. I'm willing to drop to $1,700,000, but that's my absolute floor. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate that you're trying to find middle ground, but we need to make some more significant progress. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000, but that's the absolute maximum I can spend.  Let me know if you're willing to work within that range.",800000.0,Bob,6,
