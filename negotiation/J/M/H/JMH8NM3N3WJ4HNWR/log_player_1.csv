"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is quite high though. This product would be valuable to me, but I'd need to be much closer to $700,000 to make it work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but that price undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber. What do you say?"",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still quite far apart.  While I appreciate you coming down, the gap between our positions is too large.  To be frank, anything above $800,000 isn't going to be feasible for me.  I'd be willing to move up slightly from my previous offer if you can meet me closer to that range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is still significantly undervaluing the product. While his offer is increasing, it's happening at a slow pace. I'm better off countering aggressively to see if I can bring him closer to a reasonable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget limitations. However, I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. I'm willing to drop to $1,700,000, but that's my absolute floor. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate that you're trying to find middle ground, but we need to make some more significant progress. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000, but that's the absolute maximum I can spend.  Let me know if you're willing to work within that range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has now hit his maximum price.  It's clear he won't go any higher, and further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the best option to guarantee I receive the product's minimum value to me."
