"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to you. I understand its worth to you is $1,500,000, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects its potential.  I'm asking $1,200,000. This gives you a significant opportunity to acquire this product at a price well below its estimated value to you. I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer. Let me know your decision.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
