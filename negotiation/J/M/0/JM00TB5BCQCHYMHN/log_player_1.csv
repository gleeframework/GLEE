Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is far too low, and I am not willing to sell the product for such a low price. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is significantly lower than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for my product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. How about we settle at $100? That's the highest I can go, but I believe it's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While Bob's offer of $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I've already had a chance to negotiate and it's clear that we won't be able to come to an agreement easily.  John is offering a guaranteed $150, so I'll take that option and sell the product to him."
