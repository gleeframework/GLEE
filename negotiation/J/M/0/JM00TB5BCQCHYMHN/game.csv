"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is significantly lower than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for my product. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. How about we settle at $100? That's the highest I can go, but I believe it's a fair offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
