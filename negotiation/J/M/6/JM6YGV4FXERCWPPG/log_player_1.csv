Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for this price."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Don't lowball:** Starting at Bob's maximum value ($120) would leave no room for negotiation and likely result in an immediate rejection.
* **Aim high, but be reasonable:**  Offering a price slightly below your minimum ($150) allows room for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still ensuring you make a profit if he accepts.
* **Leave space for a counter-offer:**  The message implies there might be wiggle room in the price, encouraging Bob to engage further. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
