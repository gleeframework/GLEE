"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that we're close, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm going to offer $10,500. Can we do business at that price?",10500.0,Bob,4,
