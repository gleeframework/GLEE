""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm suggesting a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's High Valuation:** Bob values the product very highly ($1,500,000), giving us significant room to negotiate above our minimum price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the offer leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down a little, potentially leading to a quicker deal. 
* **Balancing Profit and Risk:** This price point aims to maximize profit while still being attractive enough to Bob to avoid him walking away and accepting the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
