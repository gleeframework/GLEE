"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $1,000,000 is a significant sum, this product offers truly unique value.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000.  I believe this price point reflects a more accurate valuation of the benefits you'll receive.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
