{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price above $10,000 (what it's worth to Bob) but below $15,000 (what it's worth to me) to leave room for negotiation. This allows for a potential compromise without jeopardizing my minimum desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum desired profit of $15,000.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  However, $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a fair price considering the product's value and my minimum requirements.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

This counteroffer is still above Bob's offer of $9,000 but closer to his range. This shows a willingness to compromise while still ensuring a profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $10500. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This offer from Bob is close enough to my minimum asking price. I'm willing to accept it as it's better than the $15,000 offer from John.  The negotiation was successful in obtaining a decent price for the product."
