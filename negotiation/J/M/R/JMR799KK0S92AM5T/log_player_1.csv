Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I know you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $15,000. I think it's a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's willingness to pay $15,000 will give you insight into how much he values the product. If he accepts, great! If he negotiates, you still have your fallback option with John.
* **Confident Tone:** The message is positive and emphasizes the product's value, subtly justifying the higher price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always adjust your price downwards, but you can't go higher once an offer is made."
