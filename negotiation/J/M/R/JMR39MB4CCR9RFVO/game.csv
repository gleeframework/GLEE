"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you thinking of my needs.  While $900000 is a good starting point, I'm hoping to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business and personal life.",825000.0,Alice,3,
