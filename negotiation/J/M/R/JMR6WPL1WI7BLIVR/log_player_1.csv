Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of $800,000. This gives him room to negotiate while still ensuring I'm making a profit. 
* **Message:** I'm being upfront about the value to me and framing it as a fair deal. This sets the stage for a potential negotiation without appearing aggressive.
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm aware that I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  This gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. I have the option of selling to John for that amount, so it's worth pushing for a better deal with Bob. I'll counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $900,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This would allow us both to get a fair deal.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining a good margin for myself.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and express a desire to find a compromise. Using ""meet in the middle"" is a tactic to frame the offer as fair and mutually beneficial. 
* **Leverage:**  I am still aware of the alternative of selling to John for $1,000,000, which gives me confidence in my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll offer $950,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,000,000.  Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John, it's more profitable for me to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob.  Further rounds of counteroffers could potentially lower the price further, and it's not worth risking losing out on the guaranteed $1,000,000."
