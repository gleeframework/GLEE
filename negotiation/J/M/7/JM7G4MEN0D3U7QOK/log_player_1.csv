Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  I'm confident it will be a valuable addition to your operations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
This is a tough call. $850,000 is close to my minimum, but I believe I can still get more from Bob.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is significantly below what I need to accept.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $875000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $875,000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, it's still a better deal than selling to John. I'm nearing my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by pushing for a higher price."
