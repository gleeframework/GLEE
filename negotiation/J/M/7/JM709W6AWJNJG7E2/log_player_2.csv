"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential return on investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting price is too high. It's closer to your maximum budget than it is to her product valuation. You have plenty of room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,350,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to bring the price down significantly, closer to a midpoint between Alice's valuation and your budget. It leaves you room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,000,000 is a significant offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $1,200,000 is still too high. You can likely negotiate a better deal by continuing to counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I think that's a fair price and would allow us to close this deal."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

This counter-offer does a few things:

* **Continues the negotiation:** It shows Alice you are serious about purchasing but still want a better price.
* **Offers a compromise:**  By suggesting the middle ground, you signal a willingness to be fair and potentially expedite the negotiation. 
* **Sets a firm tone:** By saying ""a fair price and would allow us to close this deal,"" you imply this is a price point you're comfortable with and might not go much higher."
