"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than the $15,000 from John, Bob can likely get a better price by counteroffering. He knows Alice values the product at $10,000, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway.  He knows she values the product at $10,000, and he's willing to pay $1,000 more than that. This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is less than the $15,000 from John, he can likely get a better price by counteroffering. He knows Alice is willing to go down to $12,000 from her initial $13,000 offer, so there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, but still trying to stay below Alice's last offer of $13,000.  He's hoping to meet Alice halfway, as she's likely willing to come down a bit more to finalize the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer to $13,500, and Bob is getting closer to his goal of saving as much money as possible.  He's only $500 away from his previous counteroffer of $12,500, and he knows that further negotiations could lead to a longer process.  Since buying from John would cost $15,000, accepting Alice's offer at $13,500 is the best option to secure the product at a lower price."
