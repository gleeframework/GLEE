Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price seems a bit high to me. I'm more comfortable in the range of  $1,125,000 for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I have a budget in mind. I could go up to $1,350,000.  That's a significant move on my end. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, but it's still significantly below both your valuation and John's standing offer.  It's worth another round of negotiation to see if you can bridge the gap further."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close. I can feel it.  To show you I'm serious, I'll offer you $1,425,000. Let's make a deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is getting very close to John's offer. Let's analyze:

* **Accepting Bob's offer:** You get $1,425,000.
* **Rejecting and countering:** There's a risk Bob won't go higher, and you might end up with John's offer anyway. Plus, more rounds mean more time and potential for things to change.
* **Selling to John:** Guarantees you $1,500,000.

While there's a chance to squeeze a bit more from Bob, the difference is getting small.  The certainty of John's offer is starting to outweigh the potential gain. 

```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** It's better to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than risk getting a lower offer from Bob in the next rounds."
