"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm sure you'll find it very useful. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference and go with $100?  That way we both get a good deal.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'd be happy to buy the product from you for that price.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet halfway between our last offers and go with $97.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $97.50 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we try $92? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a bit more than $80, but I need to stay within my budget.",92.0,Bob,6,
