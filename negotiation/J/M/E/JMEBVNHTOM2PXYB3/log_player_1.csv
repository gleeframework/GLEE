"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $120. I'll try to negotiate a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference and go with $100?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'd be happy to buy the product from you for that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $95 is getting closer to what I want, I'm still within my rounds and I believe I can get a bit more. I'll try to negotiate again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet halfway between our last offers and go with $97.50? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $97.50 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we try $92? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a bit more than $80, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  I've reached a point in the negotiation where Bob's offers are getting closer to my bottom line, but I'm not sure I'll be able to reach a price that I'm happy with within the remaining rounds. John is offering a guaranteed $120, which is more than my minimum goal, so it's the better option at this point."
