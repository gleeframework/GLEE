Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we split the difference and I pay $112.50? It's a good middle ground for both of us."", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $112.50 is still not quite there for me. Let's meet in the middle at $118.75. This offer is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a deal you'll be happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $118.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118.75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum.  John is offering the product at your desired price, so it's better to go with him and save the time and effort of further negotiation."
