Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we split the difference and I pay $112.50? It's a good middle ground for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $112.50 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired earnings.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $112.50 is still not quite there for me. Let's meet in the middle at $118.75. This offer is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a deal you'll be happy with."", ""product_price"": 118.75}
