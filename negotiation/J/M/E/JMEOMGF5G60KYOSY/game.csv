"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the deal.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we split the difference and I pay $112.50? It's a good middle ground for both of us.",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $112.50 is still not quite there for me. Let's meet in the middle at $118.75. This offer is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a deal you'll be happy with.",118.75,Alice,5,
