{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
At this point, Bob should accept the offer from John. Alice is not willing to go lower than $15,200, which is still more expensive than what Bob can get from John.  It's better to secure the product at a lower price than risk running out of rounds and being forced to accept a higher price."
