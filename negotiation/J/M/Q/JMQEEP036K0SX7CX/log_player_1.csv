Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a good starting point as it's more than my minimum price of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer, while still keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a reasonable compromise that should be appealing to Bob while still ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $88 is only slightly lower than my last counteroffer of $90. Since I'm already getting a good price, and I don't want to risk him backing out completely, I'll accept Bob's offer."
