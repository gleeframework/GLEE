**Reasoning:** 

Bob is consistently making small incremental increases in his offers.  It's clear he's very unlikely to meet my minimum price of $1,200,000.  Continuing to negotiate is just wasting time and potentially losing the guaranteed sale to John.  It's time to cut my losses with Bob and move on to the guaranteed sale."
