"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your budget concerns.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but the price gap is still significant. I'm willing to make another move, but this is my final offer. I can go down to $1,012,500. This represents a substantial reduction on my part and is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber. ",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a slightly higher offer, but I think $950,000 is the maximum I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",950000.0,Bob,6,
