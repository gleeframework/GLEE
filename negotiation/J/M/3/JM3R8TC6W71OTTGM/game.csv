"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $9,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",9750.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're getting close to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,250. I can offer you the product for $9,500. This is my final concession, considering the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,7,
