"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer, but $9,000 is still not quite there. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.  What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,5,
