"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better for you:** You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is offering it for $900,000. This saves you $300,000.
* **Buying from John is more expensive:**  While you'd still get the product, it would cost you $1,200,000, the maximum you're willing to pay. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially beneficial choice."
