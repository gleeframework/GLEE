,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to do $120?  I'm really hoping to get a good deal on this.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I'm willing to compromise to make this work for you.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a little too high for me. How about $125? That's closer to my budget, and it's a fair price considering we're both trying to find a solution that works for us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $125. How about we meet at $130? I think that's a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, and it's a bit closer to my initial offer.",130.0,Alice,5,
