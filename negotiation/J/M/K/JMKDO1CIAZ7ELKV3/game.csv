"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,075,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price still allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can finally come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,075,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
