"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement. Let me know your thoughts!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle on this.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,250. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here.  $8,250 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750? This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",8750.0,Alice,5,
