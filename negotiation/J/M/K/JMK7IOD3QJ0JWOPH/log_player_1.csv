"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that's still within the realm of possibility given Bob's value for the product.  This sets a strong starting point and gives me room to negotiate down if needed. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to build excitement and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $6,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $8,500? That leaves some room for negotiation, but it's also closer to the value I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While the product is nice, $8,500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $7,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,200 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,200 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
