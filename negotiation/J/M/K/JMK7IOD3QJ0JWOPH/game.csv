"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $8,500? That leaves some room for negotiation, but it's also closer to the value I'm looking for.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While the product is nice, $8,500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $7,200?",7200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,200 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can offer. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
