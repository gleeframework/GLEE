"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal than $12,000 since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant counteroffer:**  This shows Bob is serious about negotiating and aims to get a better deal.
* **Reasonably low but not unreasonable:** $9,500 is still a good profit for Alice, considering her cost is $8,000.  This makes the offer believable and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Be polite but firm:**  The message is respectful but also states Bob's position clearly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  It's still a great price for you, and it gives me a fair return on my investment. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good deal for Bob:** $10,750 is a significant savings compared to John's price of $15,000.  
* **Alice is likely to be firm:** Alice rejected a lower price and is now offering a compromise. It's likely she won't budge much further. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  There's no guarantee Bob will get a better offer in the next round. Accepting the current offer secures a good price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
