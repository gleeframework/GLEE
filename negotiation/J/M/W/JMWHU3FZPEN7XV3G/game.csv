"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $80. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $120? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be very happy with this product. ",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $100?  That seems like a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure I'll be happy with the product.",100.0,Bob,4,
