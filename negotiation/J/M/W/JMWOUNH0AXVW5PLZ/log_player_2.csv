"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price that I believe is fair to both of us. It's a valuable piece and I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you. I'm asking for $12,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $12,000.**  This is within your budget of $15,000, but it's still more than you'd like to pay.
* **John's price is $15,000.** This is your absolute maximum.
* **Your goal is to save money.**  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially negotiate a better price with her or buy from John, but that's your last resort. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you are signaling that you are willing to walk away unless she lowers her price. This increases your chances of getting a better deal."
