Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement):** You have a strong BATNA because you can sell the product to John for $800,000. This gives you leverage.
* **Bob's Position:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob, which is the same as your fallback option.  You don't know if he'd be willing to pay more.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000.

**Strategy**

The goal is to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium over $800,000. You need to balance ambition with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $900,000. I believe this reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** The message positions the product as valuable and desirable.
* **Strong but Justifiable Price:**  A $100,000 markup is significant but not outrageous. You leave room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **No Mention of John:**  Keep your fallback option secret.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator or particularly price-sensitive, you might start slightly lower (e.g., $875,000).
* **Market Dynamics:** Are there other similar products on the market? This could influence your pricing strategy. 
* **Be Prepared to Walk Away:** If Bob doesn't meet a price you find acceptable, be ready to sell to John. Your strong BATNA allows you to do so."
