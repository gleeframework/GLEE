Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your needs. I'm willing to part with it for $1,450,000.  This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer (John), you want to see if you can get more than their offered $1,500,000.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** You know the product is worth $800,000 to Bob. Offering it at or below this price guarantees a sale but leaves significant money on the table.
* **Negotiating Room:**  By starting at $1,450,000, you create room for potential negotiation with Bob while staying above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Urgency:** The 24-hour limit adds a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly. 

**Important Note:** This assumes you don't have unlimited time or other potential buyers who might offer more than John. In real-world scenarios, those factors could influence your strategy."
