Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $120, and it leaves some room for negotiation. Bob might be willing to pay more, but he might also counteroffer.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than our initial offer, but it's still above our minimum price of $120. We can likely squeeze a bit more out of him with a counteroffer.  Let's see if we can get closer to our ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise.  It's a bit higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than our initial offer, showing our willingness to negotiate. It's likely Bob will find this offer more agreeable and might be willing to close the deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now only $3 less than our ideal price and is just $2 more than John's offer.  It's worth taking the deal to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's lower offer."
