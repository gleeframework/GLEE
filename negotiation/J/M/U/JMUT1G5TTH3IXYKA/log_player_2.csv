"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $90 is better than $100, Bob can likely do better. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $85? I'm really interested in your product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $85 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $88. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's keep this conversation going! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $88 is closer to his limit of $80, he can still potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $88 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  How about we split the difference at $86?  It's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 86}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to be fair, but $86 is still a little too low for me. How about $87?  That's a small step closer to my ideal price, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his budget and has 5 rounds left.  Even though Alice is coming down in price, Bob can likely get a better deal if he keeps negotiating. He's only $7 away from his ideal price with John, so it's worth seeing if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $87 is closer to my ideal price, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $86.50?  It's a small difference, but it would make a big difference to me.  Let's find a way to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 86.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to make a deal, and $86.50 is closer than before. However, I'm still aiming for $87.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs.  Let's make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has only 3 rounds left, and the price is still $7 higher than what he can get from John.  While continuing to negotiate might yield a lower price, it's a gamble with limited time. At this point, it's more likely that Alice will stick to her price of $87. Therefore, Bob should take the guaranteed deal with John and buy the product for $80."
