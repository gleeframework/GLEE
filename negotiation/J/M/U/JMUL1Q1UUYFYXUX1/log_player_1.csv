"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Explanation:**

This offer is based on the following:

* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so he is willing to pay up to that amount.
* **My Value:** I value the product at $1,000,000, so anything above that is a profit for me.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Starting with a relatively high price (but below Bob's value) allows for room to negotiate.  It also signals my confidence in the product's worth.
* **John's Offer:** Keeping John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind, I have a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open for potential compromise in future rounds."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum value, it's still lower than what I consider a fair price. I believe I can push for a better deal. 

* **My Value:**  I value the product at $1,000,000, and Bob's offer is only $50,000 more. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob clearly values the product more than $1,050,000. 
* **Remaining Rounds:** I have 8 rounds left to negotiate a more favorable price.

This strategy is to try and find a middle ground in subsequent rounds, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."

* **My Value:** I still value the product at $1,000,000, so anything above that is a profit for me. 
* **Midpoint Approach:** This counteroffer represents a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Remaining Rounds:**  With 7 rounds remaining, I believe there's still room to negotiate further.

This strategy aims to find a compromise with Bob while remaining firm in my desire to achieve a price closer to my initial offer."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time Pressure:** With only two rounds left, the window for negotiation is closing.  
* **My Value:** I value the product at $1,000,000, and Bob's offer is only $5,000 more. While a small profit, it's better than nothing.

This strategy is a calculated risk based on the remaining time and the potential of securing a slightly better deal. It also acknowledges the possibility of failing to reach a deal with Bob and having to settle for John's offer."
