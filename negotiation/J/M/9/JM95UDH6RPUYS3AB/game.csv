"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and I pay $115?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy it now.",115.0,Bob,4,
