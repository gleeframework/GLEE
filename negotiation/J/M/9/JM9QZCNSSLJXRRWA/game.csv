"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product. While I see the value in it, $600000 is above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $500000 for the product. This price reflects its market value and allows for a fair profit for you. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement if we continue to work together.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. After careful consideration, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $550000. This price still reflects the product's value, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I believe this price is a fair middle ground, and I'm open to further negotiations.",550000.0,Alice,3,
