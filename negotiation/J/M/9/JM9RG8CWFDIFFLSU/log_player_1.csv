{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is above Bob's valuation of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than my minimum desired price of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I've done some research and I think it's worth it to me at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $120. I'm rejecting his offer and will counter with a new offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105. This still leaves some room for both of us to feel like we got a good deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $102.50. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $102.50 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $120.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that leaves me feeling like I'm getting a bad deal. I'll counter with a new offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to go down to $108. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. It's a win-win for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced it's worth $108. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If I can't get it for $105, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's final offer of $105 is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold of $120.  I'm not willing to settle for a price that leaves me feeling like I'm getting a bad deal.  Instead, I'll sell the product to John for $120, ensuring I get the price I want."
