"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $120 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your needs.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about $135? That gives you a decent price, and it's still fair to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",135.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I am still looking for a price closer to my budget. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
