"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get closer to my desired price. Let's meet halfway - I'll accept $1,075,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I'm confident it will still be a great investment for you.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
