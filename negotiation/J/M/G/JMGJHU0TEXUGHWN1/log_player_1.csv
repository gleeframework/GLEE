Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it would be a valuable asset to you.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Find the Sweet Spot:**  Offering the product between Bob's value ($1,000,000) and your minimum ($1,200,000) creates a potential win-win.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,150,000 allows for some negotiation if Bob counter-offers, while still ensuring you make a significant profit."
