{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000 but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially earn a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1150000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair margin for both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
