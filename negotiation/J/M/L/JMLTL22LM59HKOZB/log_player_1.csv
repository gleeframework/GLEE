"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit.  If Bob rejects, we can negotiate down from there. However, if he accepts, I've secured a great deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept anything less than my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000.  This is still a significant profit for me, and I'm hoping it's a reasonable compromise for Bob.  If he rejects, we can continue to negotiate, but I'm keeping a close eye on the clock and my backup option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, I'm committed to getting as close to my desired price as possible. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm also considering selling to John if this next round doesn't produce a more promising result."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,600,000.  This is getting closer to my minimum, but I still believe there's room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John to avoid losing too much money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable accepting it.  While selling to John would be a safe option, I'm determined to see if I can squeeze a little more out of Bob. I'll make one final counteroffer, but if it's rejected, I'll go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm going for a final counteroffer of $1,450,000. This is a small concession, but I'm hoping it will be enough to convince Bob.  If he rejects, I'm going to sell to John to secure a guaranteed profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only three rounds remaining, I'm running out of time to get a better deal from Bob.  Even though his offer is getting closer, I'm not comfortable risking another round of negotiation. Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me a decent profit and avoids any further uncertainty."
