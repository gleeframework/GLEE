"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product, which is valued at $1500000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and John is selling the product for that price, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. You can get the product for the same price from John. Rejecting Alice's offer keeps your options open in case you can negotiate a lower price with John."
