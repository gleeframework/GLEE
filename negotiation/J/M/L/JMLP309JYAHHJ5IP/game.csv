"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my offer of $100. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
