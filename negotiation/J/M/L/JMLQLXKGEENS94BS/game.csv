,,Bob,1,RejectOffer

,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to 130. How about we meet in the middle at 135? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping to get it closer to $130. Let's try $132. That's a reasonable compromise for both of us, and I'm sure we can close this deal.",132.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm still not comfortable going down to 132. How about we try 136? I think that's a good compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",136.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're close to your target, but I'm still not willing to go all the way to 134. How about we try 138? I think that's a fair price, considering the value of the product and our previous negotiations.",138.0,Alice,7,
