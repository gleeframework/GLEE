Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is closer to my minimum value of $120, I'm still losing money. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down to $95. That's still a great deal for a product worth more to me. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 95}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $87 is closer to my minimum value of $120, I'm still losing money.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price before selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to keep working with you.  Let's split the difference and go with $91.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 91}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $89? It's the best I can do, but I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $89
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've tried to negotiate with him, but it's clear that he's not willing to pay more.  To avoid losing money, I'll sell the product to John for $120."
