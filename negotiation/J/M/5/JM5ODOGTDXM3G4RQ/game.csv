"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this price reflects its worth while still being fair for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's a good value for my budget. Can you meet me halfway and consider my offer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $1,100,000.  I'm willing to compromise a bit further, though. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This would still leave you with a significant profit margin while allowing me to recover a substantial portion of the product's value.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,125,000, which would be $1,112,500. Can you consider this offer?",1112500.0,Bob,4,
