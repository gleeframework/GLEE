Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this price reflects its worth while still being fair for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's a good value for my budget. Can you meet me halfway and consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a better price. I'm confident Bob values the product enough to potentially go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $1,100,000.  I'm willing to compromise a bit further, though. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This would still leave you with a significant profit margin while allowing me to recover a substantial portion of the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,125,000, which would be $1,112,500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,112,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,112,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown a willingness to compromise and his offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price. At this point, there is a high risk that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or a lower offer from Bob, potentially forcing me to sell to John for a lower price. It's a good time to secure a deal."
