Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $6,000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I understand you need to profit, and I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us. Would you consider $7,500 for the product? This price point aligns better with my budget while acknowledging the value of what you're offering."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're making progress. However, $7,500 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to think about the value I bring to the table. How about we discuss a price of $9,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems stuck in the $9,000+ range and is unlikely to significantly drop her price. It's clear she's trying to maximize her profit, even though she knows our budget is lower. At this point, continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome than John's offer of $8,000."
