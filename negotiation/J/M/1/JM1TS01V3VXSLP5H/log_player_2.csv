"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200001. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is very close to your maximum price, it's still slightly higher than what you can get from John.  Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John for $1,200,000."
