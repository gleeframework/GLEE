,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $170 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $130. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to go to $140, as that's the absolute maximum I can do right now. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think the product is worth more than $140. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $145.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I think we're getting very close. I'm going to stick with my last offer of $140. It's the highest I can go, but I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your last offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $140. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $142.50. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product.",142.5,Alice,7,
