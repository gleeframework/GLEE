Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $12,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will convince him to move closer to my desired price point."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $11,500, I want to see if I can get closer to $12,000 and  avoid the risk of having to sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's in the middle of Bob's last offer and my desired price point. This should show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than John's offer, I think I can still get a better price from Bob."

It's getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I'm running out of time. Accepting Bob's offer is the best option.  I'll make a small profit and avoid the risk of having to sell to John for $10,000."
