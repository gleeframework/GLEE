Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept but still potentially attractive to Bob. I'll be prepared to negotiate if necessary, but I want to see if I can secure a good deal right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, it's still lower than what I'm aiming for. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum and gives Bob some room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm not sure if I can push him further.  At this point, selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me my minimum desired profit. It's a safer option than continuing the negotiation with Bob."
