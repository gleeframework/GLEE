{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit for Alice. It's important to remember that Alice has a safety net with John's offer of $12,000, so she can afford to be more assertive in her initial pricing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice should reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is a good price, Alice can likely get more.  She has a safety net with John's offer, so she can afford to be more firm in her negotiation. It's better to try for a higher price by countering Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $15,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,500. This is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16500} 
```

Alice is countering with a price that is closer to Bob's offer but still above her minimum acceptable price. By offering a specific price and providing a reason for it, Alice is demonstrating her willingness to negotiate while staying firm on her value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from my budget, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $15500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice should accept Bob's offer. $15,500 is a good price, and it's closer to her desired range.  While she could try to negotiate further, it's risky.  Bob may walk away, and Alice would be stuck with John's lower offer. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of a stalemate."
