Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't pay more than $10,000 for it. Could we meet somewhere in between? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, and I'm offering you the product for $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $15,000 to you.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target. I'll try one more counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 5

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with that price.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product for $10,250.

While $9,750 is close to my minimum, I'm still going to try for a bit more in the next round. It's worth seeing if we can meet in the middle and reach a mutually agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

We're down to the wire and Bob is still not budging much.  While $9,500 is a decent amount of money, it's getting very close to my minimum.  I'm worried that if I keep rejecting his offers, we'll run out of time and I'll be stuck selling to John for a much lower price. It's time to cut my losses and move on to a more promising deal."
