"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it at $2,200,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your desired selling point. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,200,000, you're ""anchoring"" the negotiation at a higher price point. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Leaving Room:** While you have a walk-away point ($1,500,000 from John), starting significantly higher allows for multiple rounds of concessions if needed.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value without being overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).  While his counter-offer does show he's seriously interested, there's still a considerable gap to bridge. You have room to negotiate and John's offer provides a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budgetary constraints, however, my original asking price reflected the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant concession and demonstrates my willingness to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, but Stand Firm:**  While acknowledging Bob's budget, you need to signal that your initial price wasn't arbitrary. 
* **Strategic Concession:** The counteroffer is a significant drop from your initial price, but still firmly above both Bob's offer and your safety net ($1,500,000 from John). 
* **Justification:** You're explicitly stating the price drop is substantial, reinforcing the idea that you are moving towards a deal. 
* **Maintaining Value:** The language still emphasizes the inherent value of the product to avoid devaluing it in Bob's eyes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I still believe that $1,200,000 represents a fair price. I am willing to consider your latest offer of $1,900,000, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above your safety net price of $1,500,000 from John. While you could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher price, accepting this offer ensures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away.  It's generally better to secure a good deal than to risk losing it for a marginally better one."
