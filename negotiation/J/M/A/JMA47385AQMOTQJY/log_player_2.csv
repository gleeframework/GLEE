"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $13,000.  He knows the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. While I see the value in this product, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference at $12,500? It's still a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $12,500. I'll offer it to you for $12,750. This is still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's target:**  $12,750 is only $250 more than Bob's ideal price of $12,500.
* **Further negotiation might be time-consuming:** It's possible that continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly lower price, but there's no guarantee. Bob's time is valuable, and further back-and-forth might not be worth the potential savings.
* **Buying from John is too expensive:** At $15,000, John's price is significantly higher than Alice's current offer.

By accepting the offer, Bob gets a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation or ending up with a higher price from John."
