"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. While I see the value in this product, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference at $12,500? It's still a great deal for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $12,500. I'll offer it to you for $12,750. This is still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise.",12750.0,Alice,3,
