"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900000.  This is a significant discount from its true value, but I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is a discount, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000 for this product. Would you be willing to consider $850,000? This is a fair price that still allows you to profit while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $875000? It's a fair price for both of us, and allows for a smoother transaction.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is still above Bob's ideal price of $800,000, but it's within Bob's budget and represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.  Accepting this offer secures the product and minimizes the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a higher price or a breakdown in negotiations."
