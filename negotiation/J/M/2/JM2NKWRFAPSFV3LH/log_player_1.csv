Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in.  It's worth $10,000 to you, right?  I'm willing to let it go for $9,500.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's close to Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value he places on the product to make the offer more appealing.

This approach allows me to start the negotiation in a strong position while still leaving room for compromise if necessary. I can always lower my price if Bob counteroffers, but I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $8,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate:** While I could sell to John for $8,000, there's still room for negotiation with Bob. He clearly wants the product and is willing to pay more than John. 
* **Counteroffer potential:** A counteroffer gives me a chance to secure a better price than $8,000 without risking a deal with Bob altogether. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and try to get a price closer to my desired $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  By offering $9,000, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my minimum profit.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm highlighting the benefits for both of us to encourage a quick agreement.
* **Confidence in the product:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to reinforce the desirability of the deal.

This counteroffer is a good balance between maintaining my desired profit margin and showing flexibility to reach an agreement with Bob."
