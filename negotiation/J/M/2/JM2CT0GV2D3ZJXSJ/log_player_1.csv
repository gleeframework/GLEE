Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This gives me room to negotiate and potentially come down in price if Bob is willing to counteroffer. 
* **Assessing Bob's value:**  I don't know Bob's valuation, so this high starting point will help me gauge his interest and potential willingness to pay.

**Strategy:**

* I'll be prepared to negotiate and possibly lower my price, but only if Bob's counteroffers seem promising.
* If Bob seems unwilling to negotiate or is offering significantly less than my minimum, I will either:
    * Counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.
    * Stop the negotiation and sell to John for $1,000,000."
