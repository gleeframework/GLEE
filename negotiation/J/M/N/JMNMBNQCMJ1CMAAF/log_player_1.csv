Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices where a deal is possible are between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. 

**Strategy**

You want to aim high while still giving Bob an incentive to buy from you instead of you going to John.

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I open it up to other buyers. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth in the market."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Creating a sense of scarcity and opportunity can encourage a quicker decision.
* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price closer to your minimum acceptable price gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Justification:** Vaguely mentioning ""market worth""  provides a reason for the high price without revealing your guaranteed offer from John.

**Important Note:** Bob might counter-offer.  Be prepared to negotiate, but don't go below your $1,500,000 minimum. You have a strong alternative with John."
