"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can work something out.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. Considering the true value and potential of this product, I could come down to $1,325,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise and allows both of us to benefit significantly.  What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,262,500. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while also allowing me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1262500.0,Bob,4,
