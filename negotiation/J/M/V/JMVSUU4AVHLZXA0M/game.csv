"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price, considering what I'm willing to spend and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product and the price you're willing to pay. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
