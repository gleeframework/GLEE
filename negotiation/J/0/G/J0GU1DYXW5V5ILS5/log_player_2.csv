"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, it's worth more than $80 to me. Considering its worth to you is $100, I'm extending an offer to sell it to you for $95. This price reflects both the value I place on the item and the significant benefit it holds for you. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $100.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to negotiate further with her or explore other options."
