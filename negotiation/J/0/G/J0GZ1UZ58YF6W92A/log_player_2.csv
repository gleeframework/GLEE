"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a steal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $130 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $120 from John.  You're better off rejecting this offer and going with your guaranteed lower price."
