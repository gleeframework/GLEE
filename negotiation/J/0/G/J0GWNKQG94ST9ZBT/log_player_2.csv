# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice's offer is way above that. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $145. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145

While $145 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum value.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $145 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $120. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to consider buying from someone else."", ""product_price"": 120}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're sticking to your offer of $120, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to compromise again. How about we meet at $135? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $135 is still above Bob's maximum price of $120. While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's not guaranteed that Alice will budge. Buying from John at $120 ensures Bob gets the product at his target price."
