"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $170 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $145. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $145 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $120. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to consider buying from someone else.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're sticking to your offer of $120, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to compromise again. How about we meet at $135? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,5,
