"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the negotiation. However,  $9,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit too high. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $8,750.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this work.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $9,000. However, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to meet you in the middle. I'll offer the product to you for $9,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $8,900.  This price point is reasonable for me, and I'm hoping we can finalize this deal.",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,000. I'll make one more adjustment to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $9,100. This is my final concession, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9100.0,Alice,7,
