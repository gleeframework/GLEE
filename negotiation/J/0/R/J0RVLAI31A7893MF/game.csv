"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $9000. Considering its value to me is no less than $10000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns about your budget, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10500.

This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
