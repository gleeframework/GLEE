"I'm willing to make a serious offer on the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm thinking of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about $1,400,000? This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is just not workable for me.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and your potential profits. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, so how about $1,050,000? This is my best and final offer, but I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
