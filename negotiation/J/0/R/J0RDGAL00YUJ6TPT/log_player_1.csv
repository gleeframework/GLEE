Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150, aiming slightly higher allows you to potentially earn a bit more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate a price he's happier with,  while still staying above your minimum.
* **Appear Reasonable:** Offering a price just below your guaranteed sale makes it seem like you're giving Bob a good deal."
