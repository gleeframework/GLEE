"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $800,000 is a significant sum, it's below the minimum I'm willing to accept ($1,000,000). 
* **Potential for better negotiation:**  I have 10 rounds, so there's room for further negotiation with Bob.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is a fallback:**  I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, which is my floor price.  This gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking to get a little more for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a fair price given its value. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
