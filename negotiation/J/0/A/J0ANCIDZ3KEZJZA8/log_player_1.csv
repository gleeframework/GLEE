{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob has room to counteroffer without feeling pressured. 
* **It shows confidence:** You're not giving away the product too cheaply, but you're open to finding a mutually beneficial price. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  How about $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, but it's still below your desired price.  You're not desperate to sell, so you can use this opportunity to potentially get closer to your target. 

**Strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can counter with a price closer to your initial offer, signaling you're willing to negotiate but not drastically lower your price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being interested in the product.  $10,500 is a bit low for me, considering its value.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** This counteroffer is a compromise. It meets Bob halfway, showing you're willing to be flexible. 
* **Reasoning:** The message provides a justification for the price, highlighting the product's value.
* **Positive Tone:** The tone remains friendly and collaborative, making Bob more likely to continue negotiations."
