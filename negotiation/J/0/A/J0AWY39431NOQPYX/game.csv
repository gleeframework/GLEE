,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $85 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get. Let's meet in the middle at $88.  I think this price is fair considering the value of the product.",88.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $88 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference at $86. This way we both get a good deal, and I can finally get this product I've been wanting.",86.0,Bob,4,
