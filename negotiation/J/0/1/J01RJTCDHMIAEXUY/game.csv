"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $11,000 for the product. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
