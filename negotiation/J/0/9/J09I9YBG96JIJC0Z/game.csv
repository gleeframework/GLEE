It holds significant value for us, but considering its potential to bring substantial benefits to you, we are offering it at a special price of $1250000. We believe this is a fair compromise that reflects both the value we place on the product and the opportunity it presents for you.

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in your product, $1250000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.  This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
