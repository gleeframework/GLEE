,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $8500? It's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $7000, so how about we meet at $7500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close, but $7500 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $8000 as a final offer.  It's my lowest possible price, and it's a great deal for you considering the value of this product. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
