{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($8,000) to give myself room for negotiation.
* **Intriguing message:** The message is brief but aims to pique Bob's interest.
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:**  I'm not being overly aggressive, allowing Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling pressured. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  The higher starting price could lead to a sale closer to my desired value.
* **Start a negotiation:**  A counteroffer from Bob will give me more information about his valuation and allow me to adjust accordingly.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:**  If Bob rejects the offer and his counteroffers are too low, I can still sell to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $7,000 is less than my absolute minimum of $8,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, he has expressed interest, which means there's still potential for a deal closer to my desired value.
* **Gaining information:**  By rejecting his offer, I can gauge his willingness to go higher and potentially find a middle ground.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer with a price higher than $7,000, but lower than my initial offer of $10,000, aiming for a compromise that satisfies both of us."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a midpoint between my initial offer ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($7,000). This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also value the product.
* **Fairness:** I frame the price as ""fair for both of us"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and equity.
* **Message:** The message reiterates my appreciation for Bob's interest and provides justification for the counteroffer.

This strategy aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:** The compromise price encourages a deal without pushing Bob away.
* **Build trust:** The message aims to establish a positive negotiating environment.
* **Maintain leverage:** While offering a lower price, I'm still above my minimum, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $8500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $7000, so how about we meet at $7500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $7,500 is still below my absolute minimum selling price of $8,000. 
* **Limited room for negotiation:** While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, there's not much room for him to increase his offer to a point that's acceptable to me.
* **John's offer is a safe option:**  Selling to John at $8,000 guarantees I get my minimum, and I'm not sure if I can push Bob much higher.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer to Bob, but I'll be less flexible this time. I will try to push him closer to my minimum, but if he doesn't budge, I'll likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're close, but $7,500 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $8,000 as a final offer.  It's my lowest possible price, and it's a great deal for you considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm framing this as my ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage acceptance.
* **Lowest possible price:** Emphasizing it's my ""lowest possible price"" reinforces the value and encourages Bob to reconsider.
* **Great deal:**  Highlighting the ""great deal"" reinforces the value and benefits for Bob.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize profit:**  This offer is at my minimum, but it's still above Bob's current offer.
* **Pressure tactic:**  The ""final offer"" language puts pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Prepared for rejection:** If Bob still refuses, I'm ready to sell to John and ensure I get my minimum."
