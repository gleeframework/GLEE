Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great price for the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us.  What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go higher.  While $10,100 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping we can bridge the gap a bit more. Would you consider $10,300? It's a compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,300

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is very unlikely to go below $10,300, and you've already gotten her to compromise significantly. John's guaranteed offer of $10,000 is your best bet to save the most money."
