"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great price for the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,500 is closer, but still a bit above what I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not quite there yet.  How about $10,400? This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",10400.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further.  Would you consider $10,100?  That's the best I can do.",10100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go higher.  While $10,100 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping we can bridge the gap a bit more. Would you consider $10,300? It's a compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?",10300.0,Alice,7,
