"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $11,000, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** My message focuses on the value Bob will get, not my own needs. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation. 
* **Back-up Plan:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if the deal with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** I still have 9 rounds left, which gives me time to negotiate a better price with Bob. 
* **John is a reliable backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me a strong bargaining position. 

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great price for the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $10,500 is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize that $10,500 is still a ""great price,"" reminding Bob of the product's worth. 
* **Maintaining a Fair Position:** I'm holding firm on a price that is above my minimum threshold but still leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message ends with a question to encourage Bob to respond and keep the negotiation moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,500 is closer, but still a bit above what I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $10,250 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** We're still in the early rounds, and there's room for further negotiation.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better deal.

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not quite there yet.  How about $10,400? This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10400}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:** My counteroffer of $10,400 is a slight concession from my previous offer, showing my willingness to compromise.

* **Collaborative Approach:** My message focuses on finding a ""solution"" that works for both of us, fostering a more collaborative tone. 
* **Maintain a Strong Position:**  While I'm coming down slightly, I'm not dropping below my minimum acceptable price yet. I still have 5 rounds left and can rely on John's offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further.  Would you consider $10,100?  That's the best I can do.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, $10,100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for higher offer:** With 4 rounds remaining, there's still a good chance that I can get Bob to offer closer to my target price. 
* **John's offer provides security:** I can always sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails. 

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my minimum acceptable value."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go higher.  While $10,100 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping we can bridge the gap a bit more. Would you consider $10,300? It's a compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10300}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  My offer of $10,300 is a small move towards Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize a ""compromise"" that leads to ""satisfaction"" for both parties.
* **Maintain My Ground:**  I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, but I'm also showing flexibility. 
* **Time Pressure:** With only 3 rounds left, I need to start closing the gap without jeopardizing my minimum goal."
