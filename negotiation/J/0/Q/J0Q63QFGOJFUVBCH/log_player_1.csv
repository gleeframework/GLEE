Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm offering a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) to give Bob room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:** By starting at $9,500, there's a range for potential counteroffers and negotiation without immediately going below my floor price. 
* **Building Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, potentially making him more inclined to accept a higher price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I have John as a backup buyer at $10,000, so I can be confident in ending the negotiation if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob's initial offer is low, he's shown interest in the product. There's still potential for negotiation, and I can try to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $10,000 gives me the leverage to reject Bob's initial offer and push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This reflects the value of the product and still allows us to find common ground.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Building Relationship:**  My message is friendly and emphasizes finding common ground, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room:**  $9,000 still provides a potential for further negotiation if Bob is willing to move higher. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can move closer to his price or simply sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Bottom:** $8,750 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  If I continue to negotiate, there's a high risk that Bob will continue to push for a lower price, potentially driving me below my desired price. 
* **Secure Deal:** Selling to John guarantees me a price that meets my minimum requirements and provides a quick and certain sale.

Given the circumstances,  selling to John is the most sensible decision to ensure I achieve my financial goal."
