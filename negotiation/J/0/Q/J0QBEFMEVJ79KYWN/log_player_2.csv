Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $8,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $6,000?"", ""product_price"": 6000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $7,500.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $6,800. I'm willing to take a small step closer to your price.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I'm still not ready to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you at $7,100. This is a small concession, but I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.
