"Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $175?",175.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $175. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $190. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price!",190.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $190 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $180?",180.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $185. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",185.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $185 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $182.50. Would you be willing to accept this price?",182.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $182.50, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not comfortable selling it for that price. I'm willing to make one more offer: $187.50. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling it to someone else.",187.5,Alice,7,

"I understand that you've compromised a lot, Alice, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $186.25. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider buying from John for $150.",186.25,Bob,8,
