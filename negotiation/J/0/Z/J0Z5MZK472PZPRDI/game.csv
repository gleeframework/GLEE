"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,280,000. This is a very fair offer, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. What do you say?",1280000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go down to $1,280,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm offering the product to you for $1,290,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1290000.0,Alice,5,
