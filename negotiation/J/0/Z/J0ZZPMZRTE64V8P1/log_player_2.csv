"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $7,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay closer to $7,000, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer the product to you for $8,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Current situation:** Alice is offering $8,500, which is better than John's price but still higher than Bob's ideal.
* **Potential outcome:** By rejecting, Bob can try to negotiate further and potentially get the price closer to his target.

While $8,500 is a good price, Bob can still try to get it lower. There's a possibility that Alice is willing to go down further to secure the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8,000,  which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8000}
