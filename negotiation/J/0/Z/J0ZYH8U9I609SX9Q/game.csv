"Alice, $15000 is a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go up to $8000 right now.  Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $8000 is your current limit. However, that's unfortunately below my minimum price point. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. Would you be interested in $10000? It's still a great deal considering the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can find common ground.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get the product for a bit less.  Would you consider $9000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9000 is still just a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $9500? It's a fair price, and I'm hopeful that we can close this deal.",9500.0,Alice,5,
