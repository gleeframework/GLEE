"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $8000 is your current limit. However, that's unfortunately below my minimum price point. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. Would you be interested in $10000? It's still a great deal considering the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$10,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price. Let's see if we can find a more agreeable middle ground."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get the product for a bit less.  Would you consider $9,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9000 is still just a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $9500? It's a fair price, and I'm hopeful that we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Alice is getting closer to my budget, but $9,500 is still more than I'd like to pay.  At this point, it's better to go with John's offer and save some money."
