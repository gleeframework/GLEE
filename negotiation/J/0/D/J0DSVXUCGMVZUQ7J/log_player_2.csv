"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth far more than my asking price. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.** Alice is offering the product for $1,100,000, which is less than John's price of $1,200,000.
* **The offer is within Bob's budget.** Bob is willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is acceptable.

Therefore, Bob should accept Alice's offer to save $100,000."
