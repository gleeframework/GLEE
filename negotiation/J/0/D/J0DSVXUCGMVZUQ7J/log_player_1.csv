Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth far more than my asking price. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate, while still ensuring Alice a significant profit.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the potential value to Bob, increasing the likelihood of acceptance. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice still has John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000."
