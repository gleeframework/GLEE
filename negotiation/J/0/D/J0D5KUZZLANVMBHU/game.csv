"Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is limited. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $15,000 is still a little more than I can comfortably afford. How about we settle on $13,500? That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to make a deal at that price.",13500.0,Bob,4,
