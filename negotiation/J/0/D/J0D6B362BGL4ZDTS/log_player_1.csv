"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. $1,200,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $1,300,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable profit. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still not satisfied. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,250,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product for me.  Let's compromise at $1,275,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a satisfying outcome."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,275,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my offer of $1,250,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, as Bob's offer is almost at my minimum price.  However, I've already had several rounds and haven't been able to budge him much.  Given that John is a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, and I'm running out of time, I'll go ahead and sell to John."
