"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider something closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  I'm getting closer, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we settle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
