"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is reflective of its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,300,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is still a significant investment for me. I believe this price is fair, considering the value I place on it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your position, the value this product brings to the table is significant. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a substantial reduction, and I believe it reflects a fair price given its potential.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see your point about the value of the product, but $2,000,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a good compromise. I'm confident I can make this product work for me, but I need to keep my costs in check.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,800,000?  This price reflects the value it offers while acknowledging your investment.",1800000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you coming down to $1,800,000, but I still need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is a significant investment for me. I'm hoping we can come to a final agreement on this price.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
