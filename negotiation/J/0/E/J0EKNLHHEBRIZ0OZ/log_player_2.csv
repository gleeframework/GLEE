{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $10,000 is within your budget of $12,000.
* Accepting her offer saves you $2,000 compared to buying from John. 
* While you could potentially try to negotiate with Alice for a lower price, there's no guarantee she'll budge, and you risk losing the deal altogether.  It's better to take the $2,000 savings and secure the product."
