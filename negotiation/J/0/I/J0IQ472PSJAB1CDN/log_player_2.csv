"Alice's offer:

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,050,000? This would still leave you with a good profit, and it's a fair compromise. Let's try to reach an agreement.
