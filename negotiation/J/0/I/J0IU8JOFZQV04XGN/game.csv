"Hey Alice, I really appreciate you being open to negotiation.  $110 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? It's still a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Alice,3,
