Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is the highest price I can go, considering I have another option for $10,000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
