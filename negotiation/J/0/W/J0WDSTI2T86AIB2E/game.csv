"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is the highest price I can go, considering I have another option for $10,000. Let me know if this works for you.",10500.0,Bob,2,
