Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the ""great price"" and uses positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly indicates that I'm open to negotiation, inviting Bob to respond.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to my minimum value of $1,200,000 as possible. By starting high and being open to negotiation, I hope to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing me to gauge his interest and potentially reach a mutually beneficial price. If Bob rejects, I can then either lower my offer slightly or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum value of $1,200,000.  
* **Potential for Negotiation:** Although Bob rejected my initial offer, he's shown a willingness to negotiate. This suggests there's still room for compromise. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain a stronger negotiating position. I can now counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum while still leaving space for further negotiation.  If Bob continues to be unwilling to reach a price closer to my target, I can always choose to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $980,000.  This reflects the value of the product to you and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm counteroffering with a price that is closer to Bob's offer, but still higher than my absolute minimum.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, subtly suggesting that my offer is still a good deal.
* **Maintain Flexibility:**  The message leaves room for further negotiation, indicating that I'm open to compromise.

**Strategy:**

By making a counteroffer, I'm hoping to signal to Bob that I am willing to negotiate, but I'm also firm in my desire to get a price closer to my target. This approach aims to encourage Bob to come up to a price closer to $1,000,000. If Bob rejects, I will re-evaluate my options, potentially moving closer to John's offer of $1,200,000 or ending negotiations completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. Based on my budget considerations, I would like to counter with a price of $960,000 for the product. I believe this strikes a good balance between the value you're providing and my financial capacity. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $960,000 is only $40,000 away from my initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise on his part, and a good price for me.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, and I would be forced to sell to John at $1,200,000.
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Even if I get a slightly better price by continuing to negotiate, I may lose Bob as a potential customer for future deals.

**Strategy:**

At this point, it's more strategically beneficial to accept Bob's offer.  The difference between his offer and my initial target is small, and continuing to negotiate carries the risk of losing a sale altogether."
