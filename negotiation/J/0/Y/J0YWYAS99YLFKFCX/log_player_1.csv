Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth at least $12,000 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is a fair compromise between what the product is worth to you and Bob. It also leaves room for further negotiation if needed.  Remember, I can always sell to John for $12,000 if Bob doesn't accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $6,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That way we both get a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $8,000, which is the midpoint between my minimum price and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't give it away for a ridiculously low price."
