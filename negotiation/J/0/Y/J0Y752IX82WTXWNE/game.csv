"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,750. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere.",8750.0,Alice,3,
