Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my request. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a lower price of $1,400,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that suits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe I can get closer to my desired price point with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth a great deal to both of us, and I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. Let's keep the negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair compromise between our positions. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's a good deal, and it's better than selling to John for $1,500,000. I'm going to accept his offer."
