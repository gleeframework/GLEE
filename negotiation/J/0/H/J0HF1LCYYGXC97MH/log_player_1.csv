Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum price but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that you are serious about selling the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than the value of the product to Bob, and you can likely negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $850,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price is still a great deal for you and allows us to both benefit from the transaction. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I believe we can find a better balance. My counteroffer is $875,000 for your product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $875,000 is still a good deal, considering you have the option to sell to John for $800,000. It's a fair compromise that allows you to make a decent profit while securing the sale."
