Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you can afford to start the negotiation with Bob at a higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering a price of $120 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can then decide to lower the price slightly or hold firm. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps you gauge Bob's interest level and potential for a higher profit margin. 

**Important:** It's crucial to appear confident in your offer while remaining polite and open to discussion."
