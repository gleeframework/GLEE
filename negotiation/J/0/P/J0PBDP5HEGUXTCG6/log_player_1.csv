{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have leverage to start high. Aiming for significantly above Bob's perceived value increases your potential profit.
* **Justification:**  While the price is high, vaguely mentioning ""value"" and ""benefits"" provides a  reason for the price without going into specifics that Bob could easily refute.
* **Gauge interest:** This offer is designed to gauge Bob's interest level. If he's willing to negotiate down from this high price, you know he's very interested. If he rejects it outright, you haven't lost anything because you have John as a backup. 

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response. Your goal is to maximize profit, so be ready to adjust your strategy accordingly."
