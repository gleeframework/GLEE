"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $100.  This is a great deal for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Your Value:** You value the product at $120.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is selling it for $100.
* **John's Price:** John is selling it for $120.

By accepting Alice's offer, you get the product for $20 less than what you're willing to pay and $20 more than what Alice values it at. This is a win-win situation that saves you money."
