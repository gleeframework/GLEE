"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. I believe $12,000 is a good starting point, as it's significantly above my minimum value and leaves potential for a good deal for both of us.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $9,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired value.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price before considering selling to John. I will counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about $10,500?  This is still a great deal for you, as you value the product at $15,000. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm countering with $10,500. This is a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer.  I believe this is a fair price that still allows Bob to get a good value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position and would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $10,000, which is close to my desired price and definitely better than selling to John. Accepting this offer is the best option for me at this point."
