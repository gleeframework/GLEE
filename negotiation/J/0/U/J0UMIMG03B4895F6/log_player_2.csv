"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product. Given its value, I believe a price of $10,500 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,500 is less than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the product, I'm looking to spend closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind. Could you meet me halfway at $9,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $9,750 is less than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
* **The offer is closer to Bob's desired price:** $9,750 is closer to Bob's initial counteroffer of $9,000 than Alice's previous offer of $10,500. 
* **Further negotiation is risky:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or Alice becoming unwilling to sell.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option for Bob to get the product at a price he's comfortable with while avoiding further negotiation risks."
