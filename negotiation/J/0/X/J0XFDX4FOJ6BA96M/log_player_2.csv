"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I believe you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make a fair and competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is a great price, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I'm looking to stay within my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the potential savings for you and allows me to acquire the product within my limit."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $950000. Considering the value it brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price, considering the benefits you'll gain from owning this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $1,050,000, which is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While there's a possibility of further negotiation, Bob has a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  It's more prudent to take the sure deal from John and avoid potentially getting stuck at a higher price with Alice."
