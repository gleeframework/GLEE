{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is way above his maximum budget.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate, as there's still potential to save money by rejecting and sending a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from his initial counteroffer. This shows he's willing to compromise but is still firmly within his budget.  He's testing the waters to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down significantly in her price. While $1,350,000 is still more than Bob's ideal price, it's within his budget.  At this point, it's a good deal considering the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially losing the product to someone else."
