"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price, especially since we have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  Let me know what you think."",
 ""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We want to start with a strong counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling that we're serious buyers but won't overpay. We need to be mindful that Alice has a much higher valuation, so we don't want to lowball her to the point of offense."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This would give us both a good deal.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to our desired price range, $1,025,000 is still above our fallback option of buying from John. We have room for negotiation and should push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $950,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
 ""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference (almost):**  Alice came down by $125,000. We're proposing a smaller increase of $50,000 from our last offer, showing willingness to move but also holding firm.
* **Staying below John's price:**  Our offer is still strategically below our fallback option of $1,000,000 from John.
* **Positive and respectful tone:**  Maintaining a positive and respectful tone throughout the negotiation is important for a successful outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $950,000 is still too low for me. I understand you're trying to find a good deal, and I am too.  Let's try $1,000,000. This is a fair price that would give us both a good outcome.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met our bottom line.  We could try to negotiate further, but it's unlikely we'll get a better deal from Alice, and we already have John as a fallback at this price. Accepting now secures the deal and avoids potential risks of continued negotiation."
