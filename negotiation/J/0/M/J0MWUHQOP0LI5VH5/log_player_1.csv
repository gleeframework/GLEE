Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you've placed on this product, $1500000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and allows for room to negotiate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. Considering the product's value and potential returns, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
