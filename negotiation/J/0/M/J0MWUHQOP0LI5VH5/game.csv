"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you've placed on this product, $1500000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and allows for room to negotiate.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. Considering the product's value and potential returns, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1250000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
