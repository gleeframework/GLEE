"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and my minimum requirement, I'm willing to go down to $875,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,
