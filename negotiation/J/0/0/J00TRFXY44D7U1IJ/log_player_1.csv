{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking $20,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $20,000, knowing the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I use a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I phrase the offer as a starting point, making it clear I'm open to discussion. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  This offer allows me to quickly accept a counteroffer around $18,000 or higher. If it gets lower than that, I can go back to John as my backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $12,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. Accepting would result in a loss.
* **Counteroffer is Necessary:**  I need to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  
* **John as a Safety Net:** I'm keeping John as a backup option if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Step:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to reach a compromise closer to my $15,000 minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $12,000 is a bit lower than I can go right now. I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This is a really special product, and I think it's well worth it. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $20,000 to $17,000, showing flexibility.
* **Maintain Value:**  $17,000 is still above my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Positive Tone:**  I continue to be friendly and emphasize the product's value.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:**  I use language like ""find a solution"" to indicate I'm open to a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand that $17000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $15000. This is the highest I can go, but I really think this product could be a great fit for me. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value Met:** Bob's offer of $15,000 meets my minimum value for the product. 
* **No Room for Higher Counteroffer:**  There's no point in rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer because I've already stated my minimum price.
* **Time Efficiency:** Accepting Bob's offer avoids further rounds of negotiation and allows me to sell the product quickly.
* **John's Offer is Equivalent:**  John's offer is also $15,000, so there's no advantage in going with him.  

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice as it achieves my minimum goal and allows me to sell the product without further delays."
