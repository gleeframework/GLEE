"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $12000 is a bit lower than I can go right now. I'm willing to come down to $17000.  This is a really special product, and I think it's well worth it. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand that $17000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $15000. This is the highest I can go, but I really think this product could be a great fit for me. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",15000.0,Bob,4,
