"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that's worth a lot to me, and I think it could be valuable to you as well. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is higher than your minimum, allowing room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on this product, but I believe I can only afford to pay up to $15000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is your minimum acceptable price, it's worth exploring if you can get closer to your initial offer. There are 8 rounds left, and rejecting Bob's offer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $17,500? This gives us both some room to compromise, and I think this product is definitely worth that amount. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my situation. I still believe $15000 is the maximum I can afford. Would you be willing to meet me halfway between our prices? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $16,250 is a good compromise. It's a decent amount closer to your desired price than $15,000, and it's likely that continuing the negotiation might only yield a small increase. With only 6 rounds remaining, it's a good time to lock in a sale that's above your minimum."
