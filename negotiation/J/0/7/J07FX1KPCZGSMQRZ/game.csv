"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $11500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $10500 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000, which is a fair compromise. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $11000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  Would you be willing to accept $10750?  It's a good middle ground, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
