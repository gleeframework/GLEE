"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to come down from my minimum asking price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get a better price. You know her minimum asking price is likely lower than $1,100,000, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down from your initial price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your need to sell it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,080,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

Alice has come down to $1,080,000, which is only $80,000 more than John's price. It's not a huge difference, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better result. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product and saves you time compared to further negotiations."
