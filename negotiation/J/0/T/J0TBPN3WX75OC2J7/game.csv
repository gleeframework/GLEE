"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to come down from my minimum asking price. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down from your initial price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your need to sell it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,080,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1080000.0,Alice,3,
