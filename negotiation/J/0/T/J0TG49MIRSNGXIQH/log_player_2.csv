"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** $12,000 is less than $15,000. 
* **You save money:**  You get the product for $3,000 less than what you'd pay John. 

Even though the product is worth more to you, it's still a good deal to accept Alice's offer."
