"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to let it go for a competitive price. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $950,000?"", ""product_price"": 950000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards.
* **Respectful Tone:** Maintaining a polite and respectful tone helps keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Clear Target:** By stating a specific price, you give Alice a concrete number to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, we still have room to negotiate. Meeting halfway isn't always the best outcome in negotiations.  Let's see if we can get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me partway. How about we settle at $1,000,000? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer splits the difference between her current offer ($1,050,000) and our previous offer ($950,000). It shows a willingness to move towards a deal.
* **Psychological Price Point:** $1,000,000 is a clean and appealing number. It might be more persuasive than a less rounded figure. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  Keeping the negotiation moving is important, even if the steps are smaller. Stalling can sometimes lead to a breakdown in communication."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're getting close to the sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000 again, but this time, I'll throw in some additional perks and support to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has explicitly stated this is her final offer.  Continuing to negotiate might sour the deal.
* **Added Value:**  While the price hasn't changed, the ""additional perks and support"" add value to the deal, potentially making it worth accepting.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Pushing further risks losing the deal entirely. Buying from John would mean spending $150,000 more. Accepting Alice's offer secures a reasonable price and likely some bonus benefits."
