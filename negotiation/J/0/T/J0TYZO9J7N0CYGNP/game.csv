"I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're getting close to the sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000 again, but this time, I'll throw in some additional perks and support to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
