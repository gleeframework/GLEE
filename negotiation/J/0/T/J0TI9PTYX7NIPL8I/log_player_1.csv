"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but it allows for some negotiation room. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,500 is a decent offer, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14750}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $14,750. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a price closer to my initial target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob has come up to a price that is only $100 less than my previous counteroffer. Given that we're nearing the halfway point in the negotiations, accepting this offer seems like the best option. It minimizes the risk of further negotiations and allows me to secure a sale at a price significantly higher than selling to John."
