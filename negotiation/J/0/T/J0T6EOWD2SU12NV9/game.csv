"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum of $12000. How about we meet in the middle at $11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $11000, so how about $10500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $11250?",11250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Alice. I've made several concessions and I'm still not getting close to your original price. I'm willing to make one last offer. How about we meet at $10500? I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you're getting frustrated, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up on getting a good price for the product. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $11250, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal?",11250.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid I'm not willing to budge any further, Alice. I've made it clear that my budget is $10000, and I'm not interested in the extras. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm making one final offer: $10000, take it or leave it.",10000.0,Bob,10,
