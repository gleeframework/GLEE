"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend less, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $100. It's a fair price considering the value it brings.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to go to $95.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $98. It's a small step back from my previous offer, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",98.0,Alice,5,
