"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll get it for a price lower than you were willing to pay, and I'll get closer to the value I place on it. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
