"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a better price than John's offer, there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but I'd like to offer $8,500.  It's still a good price for you, and it fits within my budget."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that's still above Alice's minimum value but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while also pushing for a favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  At $9,000, Bob is getting the product for a price that is significantly better than John's offer and is still within his budget.  It's a good deal for both parties and there's no need to risk further negotiation that could potentially lead to a stalemate or a higher price."
