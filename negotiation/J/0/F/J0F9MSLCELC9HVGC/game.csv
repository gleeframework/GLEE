"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a $100 limit. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $85? I believe this would still be a good value for the product.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90.  That's still a great price for a product worth $100 to you.  Let me know if you're interested.",90.0,Alice,3,
