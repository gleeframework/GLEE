"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm confident you'll find it a great addition to your collection. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $1200000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1400000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1300000?  This would be a good middle ground and shows I'm serious about acquiring the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1300000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a bit more movement from your side. How about $1350000? This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to consider it seriously.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1300000. It's a fair price, and I'm committed to making this deal work. How about we meet in the middle at $1325000? This would be a solid compromise and show both of us are serious about closing this deal.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your creative compromise at $1325000. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more move, but I need to see a bit more value recognition. How about $1375000? This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to consider it seriously. I'm not sure if I'll be willing to go any lower, so this is my final offer in this direction.",1375000.0,Alice,7,
