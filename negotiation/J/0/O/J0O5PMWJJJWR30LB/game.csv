"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer you the product for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm open to negotiating, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement quickly.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",16500.0,Alice,3,
