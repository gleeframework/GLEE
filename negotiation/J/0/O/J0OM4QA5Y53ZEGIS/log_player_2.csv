"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be very interested in. My asking price is $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay a maximum of $120, and Alice is asking for $110. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.** You'd prefer to save money if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100 right now. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $100, which is still within my budget and significantly lower than Alice's initial price. 
* **Show Interest:** I'm emphasizing my interest in the product to encourage Alice to negotiate.
* **Room for Compromise:** I'm leaving room for Alice to counter with a price closer to my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a great deal for you, and still leaves me some room to make a profit. Let's try to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within my budget.**  While I'd prefer to pay less, $105 is still a good deal for me, and it's only $5 more than my counteroffer.
* **Opportunity to save money.**  This offer is $15 less than buying from John.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and I risk losing the product to her or being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
