"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, I think. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $8,800?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,800 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,900.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can come to an agreement. Let me know what you think.",8900.0,Alice,5,
