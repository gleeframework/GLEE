"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm prepared to offer $950000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you.  Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm counteroffering at $1050000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,,
