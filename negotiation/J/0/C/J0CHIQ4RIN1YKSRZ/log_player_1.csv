Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I know you see significant value in. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the mutual benefit. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:**  We know the product is worth significantly more to Bob ($1,500,000) than our minimum acceptable price ($800,000). This presents a significant opportunity to negotiate a price closer to Bob's valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,200,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. This allows for flexibility while still aiming for a high profit margin.
* **Professional and Collaborative Tone:** The message is framed in a way that emphasizes mutual benefit and invites Bob's perspective. This approach can lead to a more agreeable negotiation process. 

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk that Bob might reject the offer and we'd have to settle for John's offer. However, the potential for a significantly higher profit by negotiating with Bob makes this calculated risk worthwhile."
