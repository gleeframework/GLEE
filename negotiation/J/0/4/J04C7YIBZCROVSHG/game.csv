"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to discuss further.",15000.0,Alice,1,,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is quite a bit higher than I had in mind. I'm interested in the product, but I could only justify spending around $6,000. Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,12000.0
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $9,000. Let me know if this is more in line with what you're looking for.",9000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $9,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $7,500? That's the highest I can go.",7500.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not comfortable going below $10,000. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, so I'm counteroffering at $10,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",10000.0,Alice,5,,
