"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?  I'm confident you'll find this a fair price.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $7,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $6,750?",6750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $6,750 is still too low.  How about we settle for $7,000?  It's a fair price for both of us.",7000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your patience.  I'm willing to come up a bit to $6,850.  I think that's a fair offer considering it's less than halfway between our last two prices.",6850.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $6,850, but I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference - $6,925. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",6925.0,Alice,7,
