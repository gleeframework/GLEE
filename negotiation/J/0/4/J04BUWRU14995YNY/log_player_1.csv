Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum value.  This allows room for negotiation and hopefully gets Bob interested. I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $100 if I need to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is better than selling to John, so I'm going to accept it."
