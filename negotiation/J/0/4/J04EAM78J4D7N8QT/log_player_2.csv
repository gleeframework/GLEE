"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a decent price, Bob can likely do better. It's worth exploring counteroffers and seeing if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is starting with a reasonable counteroffer, offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still potentially appealing to her.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This counteroffer signals to Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product, but he's also willing to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room:**  A $1,500 difference between Bob's offer and Alice's initial offer gives both sides room to compromise in the coming rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to close this deal, what do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John:**  Alice's offer of $11,500 is only $500 more than what Bob can buy it for from John. It's not a huge difference, but still a potential savings.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Bob should continue to negotiate. It's possible Alice might be willing to go lower, especially since she's already dropped her price once. There's still room for compromise.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting the offer, Bob maintains leverage and can potentially get a better deal in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, and I'm trying to get a good deal. Let's split the difference. I'll offer $11,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to come away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:** This offer represents the midpoint between Bob's previous offer and Alice's current offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Strong Position:** Bob is still significantly below the $11,500 that Alice offered but is also above the $10,500 he offered in the previous round.
* **Time Pressure:**  With limited rounds, Bob wants to push for a deal, especially with the option to buy from John as a backup."
