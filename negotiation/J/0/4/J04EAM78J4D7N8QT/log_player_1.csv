"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to maximize my potential profit while still remaining within the realm of reason.  I'm also optimistic and friendly in my message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit. I'm confident I can get closer to my goal with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to close this deal, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

I'm counteroffering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still gives me a good profit margin. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to make my offer seem more reasonable. I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, and I'm trying to get a good deal. Let's split the difference. I'll offer $11000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to come away happy. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal of $12,000, $11,000 is a good price considering the value of the product to Bob and the fact that we are nearing the middle ground.  Accepting this offer secures a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or having to sell to John for a lower profit."
