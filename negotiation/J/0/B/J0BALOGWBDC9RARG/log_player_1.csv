"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for potential compromise and leaves me with a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, and I'm not willing to settle for a loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $105 is tempting, I'm not able to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $108? That's as low as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $108 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to settle for a loss.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $108 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. Would you be willing to go down to $107? I'm really close to walking away and buying from John at $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, the negotiations have reached a point where it's becoming increasingly likely that Bob will continue to haggle, and I'm running out of time. It's clear that Bob's counteroffers are approaching his own perceived value of $100, and I'm not willing to sell at a loss. By selling to John, I guarantee a profit that meets my minimum requirements."
