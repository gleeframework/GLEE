"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $900,000 is a good offer, I'm not quite ready to let go of the product at that price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still allows me to earn a substantial profit, while offering you a more attractive price. Let's try to find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. Can you consider my offer?",920000.0,Bob,4,
