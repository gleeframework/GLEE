While I can't disclose all the details just yet, I'm confident it's worth at least $1,200,000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,500,000. This represents a good starting point for negotiation, and I'm open to discussing your thoughts and counteroffers."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I've done some research and I believe that's a fair price for a product of this nature. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe there's still room for negotiation. He has expressed interest in the product, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than his offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the pricing.  While $1,200,000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to come up to $1,300,000 to demonstrate my commitment to finding common ground. This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate Alice's willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1200000. I'm willing to meet Alice halfway, so I'm offering $1250000 for the product. I think this is a fair price that should satisfy both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, and his offer of $1,250,000 is very close to my minimum. I'm not confident that I can get a better price from Bob in the next round, and the risk of losing him as a buyer altogether is high.  While I'd prefer to sell for more, accepting this offer ensures a sale and a good profit."
