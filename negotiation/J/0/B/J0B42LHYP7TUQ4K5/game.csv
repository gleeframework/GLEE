"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to accept that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $105?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for my product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $120, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $95. Would you be willing to accept that price?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference at $100?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to meet you at $100, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from $95. How about $92.50? That's a fair price for me, and I'm willing to close the deal at that price.",92.5,Bob,6,
