Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects a competitive price point."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $11,999 creates the perception of a ""deal"" for Bob. It's just below your minimum but significantly above his perceived value.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, ensuring you won't lose money if Bob declines.

**Important Note:** While this strategy maximizes potential profit from Bob, there's a chance he will reject the offer. You need to weigh the risk of losing the sale to Bob against the potential for a higher profit margin."
