Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $130. I think it's a great deal for something of this value, and I'd rather see it go to someone who will appreciate it."",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting at $130 allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning another buyer (John) subtly creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept. 
* **Appear Fair:**  By framing the offer as a ""special price"" and expressing a desire for the product to go to someone who appreciates it, Alice appears more personable and potentially builds goodwill, even if Bob counter-offers. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $130. He might counter-offer, in which case Alice can decide whether to negotiate or proceed with selling to John."
