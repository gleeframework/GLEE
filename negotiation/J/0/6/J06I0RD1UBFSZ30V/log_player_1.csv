"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to start negotiations with a strong offer. This leaves room for potential concessions while aiming to secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $950,000 offer signals a willingness to negotiate while still staying significantly above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Tone:** The message aims to establish a collaborative and positive tone, encouraging open communication and potentially leading to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I do see value in the product, your initial price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.  It's more strategic to reject this low offer and present a counteroffer that moves the negotiation towards a more reasonable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However,  $700,000 falls quite short of the product's true value. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to consider $900,000.  This price reflects the significant benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** Reducing the price by $50,000 from the initial offer shows flexibility but maintains a strong stance, aiming for a price well above my minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message reiterates the product's value to Bob, justifying the higher price point and subtly discouraging extremely low counteroffers.
* **Continued Negotiation:** This counteroffer shows a commitment to reaching a mutually agreeable deal while setting a firm boundary against unrealistic expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but we're still a bit far apart. I could stretch my budget to $750,000 if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still below my absolute minimum of $800,000. It's unlikely that continuing to negotiate with Bob will result in a significant enough price increase within the remaining rounds to justify the risk of losing John's guaranteed offer. Selling to John ensures I get a fair price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
