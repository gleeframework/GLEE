"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I do see value in the product, your initial price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However,  $700,000 falls quite short of the product's true value. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to consider $900,000.  This price reflects the significant benefits you'll gain.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but we're still a bit far apart. I could stretch my budget to $750,000 if that works for you.",750000.0,Bob,4,
