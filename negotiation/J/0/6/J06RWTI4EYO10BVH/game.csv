,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe it's a good price that reflects its value, and I'm willing to make a serious offer.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial price. I'm proposing $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to stay close to your initial price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a fair price that I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
