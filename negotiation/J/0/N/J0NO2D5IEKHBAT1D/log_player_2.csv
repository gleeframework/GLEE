"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $8,000.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you a price of $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price for the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than her initial offer, it's still higher than his budget.  He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to come away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to negotiate a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $9,000, which is $9,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his budget, it's still above what he's willing to pay. It's worth seeing if he can get a better price from Alice or consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already met you at $9,500, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer you a price of $9,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John.  He's already made multiple counteroffers and Alice keeps coming back with prices higher than what he's willing to pay.  It's likely the negotiation won't get him to his target price, and it's better to secure the product from John at $8,000."
