"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $2,200,000 represents my initial assessment of the product's value, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000?",1850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,850,000 is closer, it's still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,650,000, which is a significant compromise on my part. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1650000.0,Bob,4,
