Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first.  I believe it's a great deal at $20,000.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he can bring the price down.
* **Above Bob's Value:** While Bob values the product at $8,000, there's a chance he might be willing to pay slightly more depending on its necessity or his urgency. 
* **Below John's Offer:**  Offering it at $20,000 is significantly lower than John's guaranteed $15,000 offer, giving you room to negotiate down if needed. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and negotiation tactics."
