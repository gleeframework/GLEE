Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $20,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:** While you know Bob values the product at $15,000, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives it as valuable or scarce.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John, ensuring you won't be forced to accept anything below your minimum.

This strategy balances ambition with a safety net, giving you the best chance to maximize your earnings."
