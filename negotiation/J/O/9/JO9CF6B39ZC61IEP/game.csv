"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget.  Could we perhaps agree on $700,000? I believe that's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,5,
