# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

At this point, Alice has made it clear she won't go below $850,000.  It's better to cut your losses and go with John who's offering the product at your target price."
