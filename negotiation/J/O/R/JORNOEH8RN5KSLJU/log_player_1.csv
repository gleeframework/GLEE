Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers him a potential profit if he can leverage the product effectively. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" adds pressure for Bob to act quickly.

**Why not ask for more?**

* Pushing the price too close to $1,200,000 increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.  This strategy aims to find a balance between profit potential and the certainty of a sale."
