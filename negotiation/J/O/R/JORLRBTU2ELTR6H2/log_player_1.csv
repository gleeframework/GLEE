Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.  Any price within this range could potentially work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept.  Since you have a strong fallback option (John), you're in a good position to push for a higher price within the ZOPA.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Confident:** The message is straightforward, emphasizing the product's value.
* **High but Reasonable:** The price is significantly above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal. 
* **No Justification:** You don't need to justify the price. Doing so might weaken your position.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is a dynamic process. Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to consider his proposal and potentially negotiate further, always keeping your minimum price in mind."
