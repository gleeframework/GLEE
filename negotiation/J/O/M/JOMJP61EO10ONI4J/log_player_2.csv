"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your desired price and John's offer. It's highly likely you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. While I'm interested, $180 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Polite and interested:**  Keeps the negotiation friendly.
* **Signals budget:**  Starting significantly lower than your actual limit gives room for negotiation.
* **Open-ended:**  Doesn't lock you into a specific price yet."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $140 is still above both your target price and John's offer. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $110? That's a fair price that works better for me."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

Here's the strategy:

* **Acknowledgement:** Showing you appreciate her movement keeps the tone positive.
* **Direct counter:**  We're getting closer to the end, so being more direct with your desired price makes sense.
* **Reasoning:** A simple justification helps, even if it's just that it ""works better for me.""

We're now firmly in the range between John's offer and your ideal price.  Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not comfortable with $110, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $130. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting close to your limit, but it's still worth trying to push a bit further.  You're just $10 away from your target, while she's $20 away from hers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $130 is pushing it for me.  Could you do $115?  That's the best I can offer."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

This counter-offer is designed to:

* **Show effort:**  You're still trying to negotiate, showing you're serious.
* **Slight increase:**  Bumping up from $110 to $115 shows a willingness to compromise, but not by much.
* **""Best I can do"":**  This phrasing often signals a hard limit, adding pressure on Alice.

This is a critical point in the negotiation. We'll see if Alice is willing to go below $120!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $125. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is firm at $125, which is above your maximum price.  While you could try another round of negotiation, it's unlikely she'll go lower.  You've successfully gotten her down significantly, but it's time to cut your losses. John's guaranteed offer of $120 is now the better option."
