Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value creates a win-win scenario.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**
    * It highlights the product's value.
    * The phrase ""fair price"" suggests a balanced deal.
    * Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive.
* **Price:**
    * $1,400,000 leaves you with a $200,000 profit above your minimum.
    * It gives Bob a $100,000 discount on his perceived value, making it highly likely he'll accept. 

**Important Note:** This is just one approach.  You can adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's negotiating style and risk tolerance."
