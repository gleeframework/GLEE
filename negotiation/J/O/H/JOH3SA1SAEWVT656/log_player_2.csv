# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested. If you're not, I'll be selling it to John for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling the product for $14,000, which is $1,000 less than what John is offering.
* **You're still saving money:**  Even though Alice's offer is above the product's value to you ($10,000), you're still getting it for $1,000 less than your maximum budget."
