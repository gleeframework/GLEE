"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, Bob can likely do better. He's willing to pay up to $120, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. Would you be willing to do $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product will bring you great value. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $90. While Alice has come down to $95, there's still a bit of room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the back-and-forth and try to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $95, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to $90.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $97. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $92.50, which would be $93.75. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93.75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is getting very close to his target price. While $93.75 is a bit higher than his ideal $90, it's still a good deal compared to buying from John for $120.  Accepting the offer ensures that Bob gets the product and saves a significant amount of money."
