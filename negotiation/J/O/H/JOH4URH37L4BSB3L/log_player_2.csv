"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I'm looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  You're willing to pay up to $800,000, and her initial offer is $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Given the value of this product to me, I'm willing to offer you $750,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant reduction, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer $900,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a discounted rate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. There's still room to negotiate.  You're closer to your target price, but it's worth pushing for a lower price.  Rejecting her offer allows you to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $825,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it gives you a good return on your investment. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer, and I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I get a decent return on my investment. I'll counteroffer $925,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $925,000 is still higher than what you're willing to pay. While you've gotten her down from $1,000,000, the risk of further negotiations failing is high. You have a guaranteed option to purchase the product from John for $800,000. It's the most financially prudent decision at this point."
