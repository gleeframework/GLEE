"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $900,000? It's still a great deal for you, and gives us both some room to work with.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $850,000 is the lowest I can go. This is a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.",850000.0,Alice,5,
