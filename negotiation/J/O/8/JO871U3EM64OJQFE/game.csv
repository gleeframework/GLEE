"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is still a good price for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me. How about $11,000? That would be a fair compromise, and we can both close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
