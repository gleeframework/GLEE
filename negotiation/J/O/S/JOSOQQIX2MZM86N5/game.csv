,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. The product seems like a great value, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me halfway?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $70 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $77.50. Can you consider that?",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $77.50 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. Let's try $82.50. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a fair price.",82.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $82.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $79.25. Can you consider that?",79.25,Bob,6,
