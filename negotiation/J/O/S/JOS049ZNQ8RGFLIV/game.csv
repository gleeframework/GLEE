"Thank you for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $120 is beyond my budget. I'm happy to pay up to $80 for it.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",100.0,Alice,3,
