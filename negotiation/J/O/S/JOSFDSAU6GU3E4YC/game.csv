"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,200,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
