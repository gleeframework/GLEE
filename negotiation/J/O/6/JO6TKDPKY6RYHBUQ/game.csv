"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,300,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you a little further, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,350,000? It's a good deal for both of us, and allows us to reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too far from my target price. I'm willing to come down to $1,340,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's try to finalize this, what do you say?",1340000.0,Alice,5,
