"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1750000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1200000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product for $1450000. This price is still fair, considering the value it offers your business, and leaves room for both of us to feel satisfied.  What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1450000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1300000. Can you consider that?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate you meeting me halfway, $1300000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise once more. I'm willing to lower the price to $1400000. This reflects a significant reduction from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,5,
