"Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $11,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a better agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  While $9,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This reflects the true value of the product.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to offer $9,800. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,150? This reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",10150.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your proposal, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,800 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,6,
