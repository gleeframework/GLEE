Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of a price more around $900,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
