"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. He can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  He has a clear limit of $1,200,000, and Alice's offer is too close to that."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This price reflects the product's true value while still offering you a significant gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, he can likely still negotiate a lower price. He has a clear limit of $1,200,000 and can continue to counter-offer until he reaches a mutually agreeable price or decides to buy from John."
