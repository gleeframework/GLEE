**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to budge significantly from her current offer.  She's consistently rejected offers below $675,000. While we could try one more counter-offer, it's very risky. If she rejects it, we're left with her final offer in Round 10, which will likely be close to $680,000. 

At this point, cutting our losses and buying from John for $1,000,000 is the safer option. While not ideal, it's better than potentially paying a price closer to Alice's original ask."
