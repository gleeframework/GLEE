"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming to leave room for negotiation. I'm also aware that I have John as a fallback option, giving me more leverage in this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm making a counteroffer closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility while maintaining my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now just slightly below my minimum acceptable price, and given the limited rounds, I'm choosing to accept his offer to secure a sale. I'm happy with this outcome as I am getting a profit beyond my minimum requirement and avoiding the risk of a counter-offer that could potentially lead to a lower price."
