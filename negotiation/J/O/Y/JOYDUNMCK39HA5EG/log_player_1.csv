Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the dynamics:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's something that could significantly benefit you, and its value to both of us is undeniable.  I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  Given the unique nature of what's on offer, I'm confident this is a fair deal. "",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can aim higher with Bob.  A price of $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a substantial profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:** The message highlights the product's benefits and its intrinsic value to both parties. This justifies the high price and positions it as a worthwhile investment.
* **Exclusivity:**  The phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a sense of urgency and desirability, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept.
* **Confidence, not Desperation:** The tone is confident and matter-of-fact, avoiding the impression of a desperate sale.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be particularly price-sensitive or a tough negotiator, you might want to start with a slightly lower offer.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Determine your walk-away point and be ready to justify your pricing."
