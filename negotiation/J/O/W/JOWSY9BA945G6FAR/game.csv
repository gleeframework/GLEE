"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Its value is immense, and I believe it can significantly benefit you. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,900,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000, which I believe reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you see in this product, but $1,700,000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering our ongoing discussions.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,400,000, and I'm keen on finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000?  This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
