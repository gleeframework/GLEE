Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above our minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is still significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal.
* **Urgency:** Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept the offer quickly rather than risk losing the opportunity.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's personality and negotiation style, we might need to adjust our approach in subsequent interactions."
