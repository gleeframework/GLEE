"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I agree this product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000?"", ""product_price"": 700000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with an offer significantly below your target price. This leaves room for bargaining and helps gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Not Too Low:**  Offering $700,000 is a significant jump down, but it's still within a reasonable range considering Alice's valuation of $800,000. It signals serious interest but also a desire to find a fair deal. 
* **Leaving Room:** This counteroffer allows space to gradually increase the price if needed, while still aiming to stay well below John's $1,000,000 alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $700,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider a price of $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is negotiating:** Alice dropping her price from $950,000 to $900,000 shows a willingness to bargain. 
* **Still room to negotiate:** While $900,000 is closer to John's price, there's still a $100,000 difference. It's worth seeing if we can get closer to $800,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk Alice might not budge much further. However, the potential savings justify at least one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can do.  How about $800,000? If we can make that work, I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:** By offering $800,000, I'm matching what I know is Alice's valuation. This signals I'm serious and informed, without completely revealing my hand.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning I'm ""ready to close the deal"" adds a bit of pressure and implies I might consider John's offer if we can't agree soon.
* **Calculated Risk:** There's a chance Alice might reject this and try for a slightly higher price. However, it's a strong offer that has a good probability of being accepted."
