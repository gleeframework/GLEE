Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $8,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 8999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $10,000 as possible, but still entice Bob to buy. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $8,000, so we need to offer it at a price that seems like a good deal to him, but still nets us a profit.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting high leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

By offering the product at $8,999, we present Bob with a price that is significantly lower than our fallback option (John) while still aiming for a substantial profit."
