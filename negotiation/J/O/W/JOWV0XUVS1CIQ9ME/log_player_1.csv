"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $1,500,000 for it, but I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While the product sounds interesting, your asking price is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, but I'm flexible if you're open to negotiating. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I have 9 more rounds to try and get a better price from Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I'm looking to get for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my initial price. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $1,250,000?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $1250000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1150000 for the product, which is a significant step closer to your last offer. I'm hoping we can reach a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have 6 rounds left. I want to see if I can push for a price closer to $1,250,000.  There's a chance Bob might be willing to budge a bit more, especially since he's already shown some flexibility."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. Let's try to meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise that keeps both of us happy.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
