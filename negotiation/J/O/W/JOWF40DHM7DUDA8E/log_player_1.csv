Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm setting the price at $20,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $15,000 gives you leverage. You are not desperate to sell below that price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000. Offering it at $20,000 allows you to gauge his interest and willingness to pay a premium. He might try to negotiate down, and you can decide if his counter-offer is acceptable. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always adjust your price slightly downwards during the negotiation process, but ensure you don't go below your minimum of $15,000."
