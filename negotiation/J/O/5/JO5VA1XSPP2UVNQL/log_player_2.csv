"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is within his budget, it's still above his ideal price point. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10800. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,800 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget.  He can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $10,800 is still a bit too high for me. How about $10,200? That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your offer, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10400. That's the lowest I can go and still make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,400 is only $400 above Bob's ideal price of $10,000.  While further negotiation is possible, it's likely that Alice won't budge much more.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product and saves some money compared to buying from John."
