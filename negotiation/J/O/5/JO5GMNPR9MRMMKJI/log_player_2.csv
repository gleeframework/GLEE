"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $60 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $90. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $100. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's unlikely Alice will come down significantly from $100.  It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John for $80 and avoid potentially wasting more rounds of negotiation."
