"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $60 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $90. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $75?  That's a fair price that gets us closer to a deal.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $100. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise.",100.0,Alice,5,
