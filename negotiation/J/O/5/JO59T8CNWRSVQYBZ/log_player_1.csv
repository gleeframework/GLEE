Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum price of $8,000, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I'm also setting myself up to be able to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob sees this as a reasonable price and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still below my initial asking price, it's above my minimum and it's clear that Bob is unlikely to go higher.  Selling to John would be the safer option, but $8,200 is a good deal, and it's worth avoiding the risk of John rejecting my offer later on."
