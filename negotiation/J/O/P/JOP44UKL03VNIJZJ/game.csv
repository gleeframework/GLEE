"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the value I place on this product and its potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This allows for a reasonable margin for both of us.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
