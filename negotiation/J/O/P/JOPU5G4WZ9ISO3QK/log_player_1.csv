{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I've priced it slightly higher than what I know it's worth to Bob, hoping to get a good deal. I've also included a friendly message to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $150?  That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's the same price I could get from John. There's no benefit to continuing negotiations, so I'll accept his offer."
