"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal for something worth a lot more to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than what the product is worth to me, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm subtly emphasizing the product's value to me to create the impression it's a good deal. 

This initial offer sets the stage for a potential negotiation while still leaving me a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob's interest and counteroffer suggest there's room for negotiation. 
* **Opportunity to improve price:**  By rejecting, I can try to push the price closer to my desired range in the next round.

I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  That still leaves me with a fair profit and I think it's a good price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Value Justification:** I'm reminding Bob of my profit margin to emphasize that my offer is fair.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the tone friendly and encouraging to maintain a positive negotiation dynamic. 

This counteroffer moves us closer to a potential agreement while still allowing me to earn a respectable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $140. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **More room for negotiation:**  Bob's continued interest and willingness to counter-offer suggests there's still potential for a better deal.
* **John is a safety net:** If I can't get a better price from Bob, I can always sell to John for $150, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  Let's split the difference - how about $132.50? That's a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 132.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my last offer ($140) and Bob's offer ($125). This shows a willingness to compromise and makes it more likely for Bob to accept.
* **Positive and Encouraging:** The message remains friendly and optimistic to keep the negotiation positive.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the value of the product to reinforce the fairness of my offer. 

This counteroffer is a strong attempt to reach an agreement while still staying above my minimum acceptable price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** Bob is still offering $120, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited negotiation potential:**  We've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems like Bob is unwilling to budge much further.
* **John provides a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $150 will give me a guaranteed profit and is the most sensible choice at this point. 

While I'd prefer to get a slightly higher price from Bob, the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower offer or a failed deal outweighs the potential benefit. It's time to secure a guaranteed profit by selling to John."
