"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a deal at $10,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",10200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $9,750?  That's a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price at $9,750, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a deal at $10,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
