"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price that allows for a good profit for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is more than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still gives you a significant benefit over your estimated value.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $850,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference closer to your last offer, say $800,000? That seems like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could try to get more in subsequent rounds, there's no guarantee.  Accepting this offer ensures I meet my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob backing out or me needing to sell to John."
