Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you a price of $130. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $115 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer you a price of $125. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.

You have three options:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $125, Bob. I think we've been close, but I need to make a profit. I'll stick with my previous offer of $125. It's a fair price that I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is sticking to her price of $125 and has indicated she won't go lower. It's unlikely we'll get a better deal from her at this point. Accepting $125 is still a better deal than buying from John at $150."
