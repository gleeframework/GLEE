"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by many of our customers. I believe it would be a great addition to your collection. For this exclusive opportunity, I am offering it to you for $85. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is a good price, you're aiming to save as much as possible. There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially get it for even less by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to pay closer to $60.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 60}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within the realm of reason given my maximum budget of $150.  This aggressive approach aims to establish a lower starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your interest and feedback, I am willing to consider a price closer to your budget. Therefore, I propose a price of $70 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, but $70 is still above my target price of $60. I'm going to continue pushing for a lower price. There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $70 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to go to $65. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 65}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer by a small amount to show I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still pushing for a price closer to my ideal target. I'm hoping Alice will be willing to accept a price within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. After considering your offer, I am willing to sell the product for $68. This is the lowest price I can go while still ensuring a reasonable profit for myself. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $68. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $68
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $68, which is very close to my target price of $65 and well within my budget of $150.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or I'll run out of rounds. It's a good deal, and accepting now minimizes the risk of losing the product or paying more later."
