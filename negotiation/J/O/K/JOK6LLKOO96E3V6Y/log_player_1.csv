Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's higher than your minimum price of $150, giving you room to negotiate down if necessary.  It also gives you a chance to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get him to make the first counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I believe $150 would be a fair price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Since Bob is offering your minimum price, it's best to accept his offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation. You're guaranteed to get your minimum value, and there's no guarantee that a counteroffer will yield a better price."
