"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's unique and has a lot of potential value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000. This is a great deal considering its true worth. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you're willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product, and Alice's offer is exactly that amount, you're not saving any money by accepting.  You can get the product from John for the same price, so rejecting Alice's offer gives you the option to negotiate with her or potentially find a better deal elsewhere."
