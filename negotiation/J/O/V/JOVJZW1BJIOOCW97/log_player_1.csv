Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll agree. I'm asking for $1,999,999. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1999999}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Since Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting with a significantly higher offer allows room for negotiation while aiming for a price well above your minimum.
* **Odd Pricing:** The specific price of $1,999,999 creates a sense of specificity and might make Bob perceive the offer as more considered. 
* **Creating Urgency:** By not mentioning John, there's a subtle implication that this might be Bob's only chance to acquire the product.

**Important Note:** This strategy is risky. Bob might be completely turned off by the extremely high price and refuse to negotiate. However, given that you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, this approach maximizes your potential profit if Bob is willing to negotiate."
