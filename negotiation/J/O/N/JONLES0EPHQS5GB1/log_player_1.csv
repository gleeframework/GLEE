{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $11,500 is above your minimum of $10,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  It's below Bob's perceived value of $12,000, leaving space for Bob to counteroffer, potentially bringing the price closer to your target.
* **It demonstrates confidence:** By starting high, you show confidence in the product's value and set the stage for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm not quite ready to go that high yet.  How about $10,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin. It's worth attempting to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price of $11,500. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can counter with a price closer to your initial offer, potentially leading to a mutually acceptable agreement."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little to $11,000. That's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
