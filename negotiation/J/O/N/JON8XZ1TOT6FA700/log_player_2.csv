Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You've successfully negotiated a lower price than Alice's initial offer. While $112 is not the absolute lowest you could possibly get, it's within your budget and a good deal considering you're getting a product worth $150 to you for significantly less.  It's a good time to accept the offer and finalize the deal."
