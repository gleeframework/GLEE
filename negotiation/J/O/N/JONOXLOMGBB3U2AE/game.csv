"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our negotiation, I'm not able to accept $1,050,000 at this time.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still allows me to achieve my goal, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
