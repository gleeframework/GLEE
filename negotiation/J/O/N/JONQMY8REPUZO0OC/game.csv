"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my situation, Alice. I appreciate the offer, but I still believe $10,000 would be a fair price for the product. Let me know if there's any way we could reach an agreement at that price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  While I want to find a solution that works for us both, I can't go as low as $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $16,000? This is a significant price reduction and reflects my desire to work with you.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $12,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as it aligns closely with my budget.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $12,000 is just too low.  Could we agree on $14,500?  This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",14500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I've given this some more thought, and I'd like to propose a price of $13,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value of the item.",13000.0,Bob,8,
