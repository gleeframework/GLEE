Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has consistently stuck to a price ceiling around $12,000 - $13,000. While he's showing willingness to negotiate, it's unlikely he'll drastically increase his offer in the remaining rounds. Accepting his offer at $13,000 would mean a $2,000 loss compared to John's offer. It's strategically more beneficial to cut negotiations short and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
