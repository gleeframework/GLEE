"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, $100 is a bit over my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $85 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit too high.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $90 is still a bit low.  How about we compromise at $92.50? This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",92.5,Alice,5,
