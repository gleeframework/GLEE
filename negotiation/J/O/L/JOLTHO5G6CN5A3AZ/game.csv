"I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,250. I believe this price is a fair compromise considering the value the product will bring to you.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  $9,250 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $8,750. This represents a significant saving for me while still being a fair price for you.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, which is still a compromise from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the value the product will bring to you.",9000.0,Alice,5,
