Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a great asset to you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. 
* **Backup Option:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While $8,000 is Bob's perceived value, he might be willing to pay slightly more if he sees the product as highly valuable or difficult to obtain elsewhere. 
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or try to negotiate the price. You'll need to decide how much you're willing to go down while still making a profit you're comfortable with."
