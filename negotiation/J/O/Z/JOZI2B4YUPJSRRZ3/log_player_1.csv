""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving you significant resources in the long run.  I'm willing to make this transaction happen for $925,000. This is a one-time offer, so please let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible while ensuring he's likely to accept.
* **Understanding Value:** Bob has a strong incentive to buy as he gains $75,000 in value ($1,000,000 - $925,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong offer, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to an even higher final price. 
* **Backup Plan:**  The safety net of John's $800,000 offer means we're not desperate and can confidently aim high with Bob."
