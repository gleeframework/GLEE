"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something you've shown interest in before, and I think it could really benefit your business. I'm offering it to you at a price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from what I'd be able to get elsewhere, and it allows you to acquire this valuable asset at a very attractive price. Let me know what you think!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than her stated value, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Therefore, rejecting her offer and going with John saves you $2,000 and meets your goal of getting the best possible price."
