"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but the gap between $850,000 and my valuation is substantial. This product offers significant potential, and I believe $1,000,000 is a more accurate reflection of its value. This offer allows both of us to benefit.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a fair compromise. It's a good price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to make a good profit. Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this simple - $950,000, and we have a deal. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",950000.0,Alice,5,
