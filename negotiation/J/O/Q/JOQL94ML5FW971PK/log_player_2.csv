"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its true value, and I believe it would be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for a lower price from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm really looking to stay within a budget of $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Would you be interested in $9,000? This would still be a great value for you, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what John is offering.  There's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice when a better deal is readily available."
