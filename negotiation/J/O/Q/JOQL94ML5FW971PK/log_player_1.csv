Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its true value, and I believe it would be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and persuasive tone to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to sway him.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and see if I can get close to my target price. If Bob rejects my offer, I'm prepared to counter with a lower price. However, I will keep in mind that John is a potential buyer willing to pay my minimum acceptable price, so I won't go too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm really looking to stay within a budget of $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **John is a safe option:**  John is willing to pay my minimum price, which makes him a very reliable alternative.
* **Negotiation room:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range, potentially getting a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than his offer but still below my minimum. This will demonstrate that I'm willing to negotiate but also maintain my desired profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Would you be interested in $9,000? This would still be a great value for you, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counter-offer of $9,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my target.
* **Value proposition:** I'm highlighting the value proposition of the product for Bob even at $9,000, emphasizing it's still a good deal for him. 
* **Maintain bargaining power:**  I'm not going down to Bob's initial price, demonstrating that I'm serious about my minimum acceptable price and not desperate for a sale.

**Strategy:**

I'm using a strategic approach of making a counter-offer that is higher than Bob's offer but still within a reasonable range. This will hopefully entice Bob into accepting the offer, allowing me to maximize my profit while still securing a deal."
