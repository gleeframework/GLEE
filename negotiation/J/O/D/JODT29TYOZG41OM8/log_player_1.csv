Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first for $160. I believe it's a great deal and worth more, but I'm giving you priority."", 
""product_price"": 160
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:**  You know Bob values the product at $100. This is valuable information.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $150 because you have another buyer lined up.
* **Creating Value:** Offering the product slightly above Bob's perceived value, while still below your minimum acceptable price, aims to create the perception of a deal.
* **Justification:** Giving a reason for the ""discount"" (like prioritizing Bob) can make the offer more appealing.

**Why this strategy might work:**

* **Perceived Gain:** Bob might see this as a chance to make a $60 profit in the future (if he decides to resell).
* **Scarcity Tactic:**  By mentioning you have another buyer, you subtly introduce a fear of missing out.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept. If he's rational and knows he can only resell at $100, he might decline."
