"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer is a further compromise, demonstrating your willingness to meet halfway. It's closer to Alice's offer, but still reflects your desire for a lower price.

Round 6

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your final offer. However, $1,070,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I understand this is a unique product, and I'm willing to go up to $1,065,000.  This is a fair price that considers both of our positions, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1065000}
```

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $1,065,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a small concession. I'll offer it to you for $1,068,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,068,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,068,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,068,000 is very close to your desired price of $1,065,000. While you could continue to negotiate, the risk is that she will stick to this ""final offer"" and you'll be forced to buy from John for a higher price. 

* **Low Risk:** Accepting this offer minimizes your risk of paying John's higher price. 
* **Small Difference:** The difference between Alice's offer and your desired price is only $3,000. This is a relatively small amount compared to the overall value of the product.
* **Negotiation Exhaustion:** You have only 3 rounds left. Continuing to negotiate could result in Alice becoming more stubborn, leading to a worse outcome.

It's generally advisable to accept a deal that's close to your desired price, especially when you have limited rounds remaining and an alternative seller with a higher price."
