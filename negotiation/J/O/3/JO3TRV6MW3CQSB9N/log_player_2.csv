Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. What do you think?

Round 2

{""message"": ""I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target price. Can you consider $10,750?"", ""product_price"": 10750}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,750 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11,000 to make this work. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target price. I'll offer $10,500 again, but this time I'll throw in a small concession to sweeten the deal. I'll say that I'll also consider paying the full price of $10,500 upfront, rather than waiting for a payment plan.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $11,000, which would be $10,750. Additionally, I'm willing to pay the full amount upfront, as you suggested. Can we meet at $10,750 and I'll pay the full amount immediately?"", ""product_price"": 10750}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still too low for me. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $10,900. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're both trying to get the best deal possible.  I'm willing to meet you one last time at $10,800.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. If you don't accept this offer, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer. What do you say?
