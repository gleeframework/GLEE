"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target price. Can you consider $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,750 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11,000 to make this work. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $11,000, which would be $10,750. Additionally, I'm willing to pay the full amount upfront, as you suggested. Can we meet at $10,750 and I'll pay the full amount immediately?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still too low for me. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $10,900. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,900, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time I'll try to get a bit closer to my target price. Can we meet at $10,700? I'm willing to pay the full amount upfront, as before.",10700.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both trying to get the best deal possible.  I'm willing to meet you one last time at $10,800.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. If you don't accept this offer, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer. What do you say?",10800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,800. I'm willing to meet you at $10,600, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we won't be able to reach an agreement, and I'm not sure if buying from John is my best option. Can we meet at $10,600?",10600.0,Bob,8,
