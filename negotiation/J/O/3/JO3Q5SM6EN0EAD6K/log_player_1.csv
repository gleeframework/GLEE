Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **High Starting Point:** $19,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but leaves room for negotiation if he's interested.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value and my reluctance to sell it cheaply by mentioning a public listing. This creates a sense of scarcity and exclusivity. 

**Outcome:**

* **Best Case:** Bob accepts the $19,000 offer, resulting in a $4,000 profit over selling to John.
* **Worst Case:** Bob rejects the offer, and I sell to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
