Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,199,999. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1199999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John offers your minimum acceptable price, the goal is to extract the maximum possible value from Bob.
* **Just Below Guarantee:** Offering the product at $1,199,999 puts Bob right at the edge of his potential loss. If he values the product at $800,000, this price ensures he doesn't profit if he buys and resells.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to make a quicker decision.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have no way of knowing Bob's exact valuation beyond the $800,000 minimum. In reality, understanding your buyer's needs and motivations is crucial for successful negotiation."
