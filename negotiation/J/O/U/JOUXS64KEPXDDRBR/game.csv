,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  I could come down to $15,000. I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still only able to offer $8,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given my budget constraints.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I am still unable to meet your request at $13,000. I am sticking to my offer of $8,000. I hope we can find a way to agree on this price.",8000.0,Bob,6,
