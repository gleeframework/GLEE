Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, I've done my research and I believe the product's value to you is higher than you're willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $16,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $15,000.  You should reject the offer and continue negotiating for a lower price. Remember, you can always buy from John for $15,000 if you don't reach a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're willing to pay a premium for this product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm now offering the product to you for $15,500. It's a compromise, but I think it's a reasonable price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget, even though it's getting closer.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  At this point, you're very close to your budget, so you need to be careful not to overspend. Remember, you can always buy from John for $15,000 if you don't reach a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $15,500 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product, which is my absolute limit. It's a fair price considering its value to me and my budget.  Let's close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really close to making a decision, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $15,000. I'm willing to meet you at the halfway point between $15,000 and $15,500, which is $15,250. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,250 is still above your budget of $15,000. You have already reached a point where further negotiation might not lead to a lower price, and you have only a few rounds left. Given you have a reliable alternative with John who's willing to sell at your desired price, it's more efficient to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
