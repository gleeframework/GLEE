"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $800,000 to you, giving you a significant profit potential. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High initial offer:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, giving me room to negotiate down. 
* **Appealing to Bob's self-interest:**  I'm highlighting the potential profit for Bob, making the offer more attractive.
* **Confidence in the deal:** I express confidence in a mutually beneficial outcome,  which can help build trust and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but considering my budget and the fact that the product is worth $800,000 to me, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I want to see if I can push for a higher price by counter-offering.
* **Time constraints:** I have 8 rounds left, so I can afford to reject Bob's offer and see if he's willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counter-offer of $1,100,000. This is a compromise, but it still keeps me above my minimum price of $1,000,000.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth and emphasizing the potential profit.
* **Mutual benefit:** I'm reframing the negotiation as a collaborative effort to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to me and my financial constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for higher price:**  I still have 6 rounds left, so I believe I can continue negotiating for a higher price. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting the offer keeps me in control of the negotiation and allows me to explore other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer, but we're still not quite there. I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000. This is a good compromise, and it shows our commitment to finding common ground. Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1075000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small compromise:** I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still holding firm above my minimum price.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the progress we've made and the spirit of compromise.
* **Urgency:**  I'm hinting at a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I appreciate your efforts in negotiating. Given the value of the product to me and my budgetary considerations, I would like to propose a price of $1,025,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise while respecting the value of the product to both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is running out:** We are in round 6, with only 4 rounds left. 
* **Risk of losing value:**  Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to my minimum price of $1,000,000.  There's a high risk that further negotiation will result in a lower price.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  This is a safer and more predictable option than continuing the negotiation with Bob."
