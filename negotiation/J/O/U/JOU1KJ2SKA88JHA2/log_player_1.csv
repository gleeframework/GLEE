Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price is fair considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This gives me room for negotiation while still securing a good price.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the price as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves room for a counteroffer without risking losing the sale entirely.  If Bob rejects, I can then lower the price slightly, but hopefully not too much.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts:  Great! I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects:  I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Not Ready to Sell to John:** While John is a guaranteed buyer, I'm not ready to settle for his $800,000 offer just yet. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price between his $700,000 offer and my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my minimum price ($800,000) and Bob's offer ($700,000). 
* **Reiterating Value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value to emphasize the fairness of my price.
* **Seeking Finalization:**  I express a desire to finalize the deal, putting pressure on Bob to respond positively. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts:  I've secured a good price for the product.
* If Bob rejects: I'll need to assess the situation carefully. If his counteroffer is still significantly lower, I might consider selling to John to avoid further delays."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a valuable product, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? I'm ready to close the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $775,000 is only $25,000 above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him lowering his offer further or stalling the process.
* **Secure Sale with John:** John is a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, offering a safe and predictable outcome.  

**Next Steps:**

* **Selling to John:** I will sell the product to John to avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob. While I'd prefer to get closer to Bob's initial value of $1,000,000, John's offer is reliable and within my minimum acceptable range."
