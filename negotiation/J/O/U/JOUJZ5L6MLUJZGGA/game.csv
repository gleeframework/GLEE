"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $18000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16500, which is still a good value for you considering the product's worth. Let's try to make this work.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $16500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $15750? It's a fair price that's within my budget and closer to your asking price.",15750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm going to meet you halfway on this one. How about we settle on $15500? It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my budget. Would you consider $15250? It's a reasonable compromise and allows us to close the deal quickly.",15250.0,Bob,6,
