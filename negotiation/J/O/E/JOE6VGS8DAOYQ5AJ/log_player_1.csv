Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  This is a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I can lower my price slightly, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price and even below what the product is worth to him.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $5,000 is far too low. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is closer to my desired range, it's still below what I consider to be a reasonable price. I'll reject this offer and counter with a price closer to $9,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that's too far below my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $7,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8500}
