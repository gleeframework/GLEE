"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $5,000 is far too low. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,000? That's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  $7,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested.",8500.0,Alice,5,
