"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to your response.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're trying to get closer to your budget, but I still think $1,200,000 is a fair price considering the product's value to you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still beneficial for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,000,000.  I'd be happy to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from your initial offer and represents a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to your budget as possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,050,000. I'm offering the product to you for $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
