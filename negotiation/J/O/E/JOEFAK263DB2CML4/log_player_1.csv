"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer meets your minimum acceptable price, you can likely get more. You've already established that the product is worth more to him. It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,300,000? It's still a great deal for you, and we can close this deal quickly. "", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This counteroffer acknowledges Bob's budget constraint while still pushing for a higher price. It also emphasizes the speed and ease of closing the deal, making it more appealing for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This offer is a good compromise. While it's not your ideal price, it's close to the middle ground, and it's significantly better than selling to John.  Accepting this offer allows you to close the deal quickly and secure a substantial profit."
