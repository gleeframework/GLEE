"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there at $7,750. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $8,250. It's a fair price for both of us and a good compromise.",8250.0,Alice,5,
