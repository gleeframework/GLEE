"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly useful for someone in your position and would be happy to answer any questions you might have. I'm asking for $16,000 for it. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $16,000 represents a fair price for its value, I understand your budget constraints. Could you consider $13,000?  That's a significant reduction on my end.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $13,000 is a bit too steep for me.  Could you do $10,000? That's a good compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  This would be my final offer. ",11500.0,Alice,5,
