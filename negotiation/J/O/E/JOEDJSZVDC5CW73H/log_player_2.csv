"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly useful for someone in your position and would be happy to answer any questions you might have. I'm asking for $16,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is far too high. It makes more sense to either counteroffer or buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $16,000 represents a fair price for its value, I understand your budget constraints. Could you consider $13,000?  That's a significant reduction on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $13,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still too high for my budget. I'll try one more counteroffer, but if she doesn't budge, I'll go with John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $13,000 is a bit too steep for me.  Could you do $10,000? That's a good compromise and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  This would be my final offer.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Alice has come down a bit in price, but $11,500 is still higher than my maximum budget.  I'd rather go with John and save myself $3,500."
