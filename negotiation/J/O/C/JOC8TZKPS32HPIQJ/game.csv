"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value you place on this product, I'm unfortunately unable to meet your price. Considering my budget and the market value of similar products, I'd be willing to offer $1200000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1800000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1800000 is closer to my budget, I'm still looking to finalize the deal at a lower price. I'm willing to offer $1400000. This reflects the market value of similar products and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's try to reach a final decision.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1700000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
