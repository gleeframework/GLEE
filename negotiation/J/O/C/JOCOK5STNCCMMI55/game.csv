"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we say $140?",140.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $120. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make at least $160. How about we say $155?",155.0,Alice,5,
