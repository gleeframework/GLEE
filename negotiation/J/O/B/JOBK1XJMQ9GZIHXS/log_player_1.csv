Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find valuable."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your $12,000 value as possible. Offering it slightly below this at $11,999 maximizes potential profit.
* **Create Urgency:** By positioning it as a ""fantastic deal"" Alice implies Bob might not get another chance at this price. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a safety net. Alice won't settle for less than her guaranteed value.

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice cannot negotiate further with John to potentially get a price higher than $12,000."
