"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which is my absolute maximum.  If you're serious about selling, this is the best I can do.",8000.0,Bob,4,
