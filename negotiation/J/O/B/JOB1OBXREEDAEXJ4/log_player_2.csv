"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $9,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.  It's a starting point for negotiation, and it leaves room for potential compromise.  Bob is trying to be aggressive while still being reasonable, hoping to incentivize Alice to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $8,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob is determined to get the best deal possible, and since John is offering the product for $8,000, it makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice. There's a chance Bob can get a better price from Alice, and if not, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which is my absolute maximum.  If you're serious about selling, this is the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now proposing his maximum price, signaling his strong desire to close the deal.  He's trying to meet Alice halfway, while remaining within his budget.  This move increases the pressure on Alice to make a decision."
