Bob's offer:

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,600,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why: 

* **Profitable:** It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and secures a good profit. 
* **Time Value:** Prolonging the negotiation with Bob risks losing the deal entirely. John's offer is a good safety net but doesn't allow for exceeding $1,500,000.
* **Bob's Limit:** Bob's message suggests $1,600,000 might be his upper limit. Pushing further could make him walk away."
