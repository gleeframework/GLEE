I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while ensuring I don't immediately undervalue my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my minimum to see if we can reach a compromise."

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price.  I'm going to counter again to see if we can reach a middle ground."
