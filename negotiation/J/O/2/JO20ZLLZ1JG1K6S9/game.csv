"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. This offer represents a significant investment on my end, while still leaving a fair profit margin for you.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to invest in our product. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I still need to be mindful of my budget.  How about $1,125,000? That's right in the middle of our last offers and seems like a fair compromise.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,125,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your target price, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
