Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I have to consider the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $800,000. My counteroffer is $820,000. I'm confident you'll see the value it brings and be willing to make a slight adjustment to your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000.

While Alice's offer is still above my ideal price, it's within my budget and represents a good compromise.  It's worth accepting to avoid the risk of further negotiations and potentially losing the product to another buyer."
