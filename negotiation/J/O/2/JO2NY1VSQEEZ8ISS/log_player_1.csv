"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I've carefully considered its value and believe a price of $1,400,000 would be fair for both of us. It's a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the potential benefit to Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message indicates a willingness to discuss the price, suggesting flexibility. 
* **Plan B:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a backup, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob is unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lowball Offer:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  While Bob's offer is far too low, it's an opportunity to continue negotiating and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** I can use John's offer of $1,500,000 as leverage to push Bob closer to a more acceptable price.

**Next Steps:** In the next round, I will send a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions. I will likely propose a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's current offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This price reflects the value of the product while also acknowledging your budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counterproposal:** I'm offering a compromise by proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize that the proposed price balances the value of the product with Bob's financial constraints.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback option, making it clear that I'm not desperate for a deal.
* **Open to Further Discussion:** I conclude the message with an invitation to further discussion, signaling a willingness to negotiate.

**Goal:** This counteroffer aims to:

*  Gauge Bob's willingness to compromise.
*  Move the negotiation closer to a mutually acceptable price.
*  Maintain a strong negotiating position while demonstrating flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $1,250,000? This is my maximum willingness to pay, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is slightly higher, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a significant financial loss.
* **Negotiation Continues:** I believe there's still room for negotiation and potentially a more favorable price.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  I can use John's offer as leverage to push Bob closer to my minimum price. 

**Next Steps:** 

I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price but still allows for negotiation.  I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John if Bob continues to be unreasonable."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point about your budget, but I'm still a bit away from a price that makes sense for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but $1,250,000 is just not enough.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,325,000? It's a compromise that reflects the value of the product while staying within your range. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Justification:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  I provide a reason for this price, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Staying Firm on Minimum:**  This price is still higher than Bob's offer but is closer to my desired price.  
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm not conceding too much and keeping John's offer as a viable option if Bob continues to be unreasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I conclude the message with a question, prompting Bob to respond and potentially move the negotiation forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $1,280,000? This is my maximum willingness to pay, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob has moved slightly closer to my desired price, his offer of $1,280,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would mean a significant financial loss.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** We are nearing the end of the negotiation, and I need to be strategic about maximizing my profit.
* **John's Offer as Backup:** I still have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000, which is a significantly better deal for me.

**Next Steps:** I will make a final counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap further. If Bob still refuses to budge, I will likely sell to John to secure the higher price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm starting to run out of time and need to make a decision.  I'm willing to make one final concession. Let's meet at $1,300,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement. It's our last chance to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm making one last compromise, dropping my price slightly to show my willingness to reach a deal.
* **Time Pressure:** I'm emphasizing the limited time remaining to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Last Chance:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, leaving no room for further negotiation.
* **Closing the Gap:** The price is closer to Bob's offer, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **John's Offer as Backup:** I'm prepared to sell to John if Bob rejects this offer, so I'm not afraid to walk away.

**Goal:** This counteroffer aims to:

* Secure a final price that's acceptable to both parties.
* Close the deal before time runs out.
* Maximize my profit while still reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're making a final concession, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,275,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** We are down to our last two rounds, and there's limited time to negotiate further. 
* **Significant Gap:** Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's unlikely he'll budge much more.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, which provides a much better outcome for me financially. 

**Conclusion:**  I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss, even if it means walking away from a deal with Bob.  Selling to John ensures that I get the best possible price for my product, minimizing my financial risk."
