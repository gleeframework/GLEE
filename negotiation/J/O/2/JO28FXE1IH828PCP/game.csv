"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $100? ",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit too high.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $108. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",108.0,Alice,5,
