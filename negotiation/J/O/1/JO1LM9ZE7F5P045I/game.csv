"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see your point. While $950,000 is still a bit below where I need to be, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll accept $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
