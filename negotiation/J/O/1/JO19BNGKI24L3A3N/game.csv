"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm confident the product is valuable, but I'm looking to get it for closer to $1250000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To try to meet somewhere in the middle, I would like to suggest a revised price of $1375000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering both the value of the product to you and my need to maximize the sale price. I look forward to your feedback.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1375000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects our both our needs.  I'm ready to move forward with a price of $1300000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're making progress. Considering the value of the product to you and the current market conditions, I believe a fair price for the product would be $1325000. This price allows for a reasonable profit while still being competitive in the market. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
