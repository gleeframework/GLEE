"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting high, at $1,400,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a good profit for myself. 
* I want to gauge Bob's interest and see how willing he is to pay closer to my product's true value to him. 
* This initial offer allows for 10 rounds of negotiation.  If Bob is not willing to negotiate, I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, guaranteeing a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. While it's a profit, it's not the best I can achieve. 
* I'm choosing to reject his offer to see if I can get closer to my target price through further negotiation.  
* I still have 8 rounds remaining, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility and encourage Bob to come closer to my target price.
* $1,300,000 is still a very good price for me, and it's a reasonable counteroffer given Bob's initial proposal.
* By lowering the price, I'm demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a significant profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

*  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still not ideal. I'm aiming for a higher profit. 
* I have 6 rounds left, which gives me enough time to try and squeeze out a better deal.  
* I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price or, if all else fails, sell to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm continuing to lower my price, but by a smaller amount this time. This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I'm not willing to give away too much profit.
* $1,250,000 is still a good price for me, especially considering Bob's value of the product.
* With 5 rounds remaining, I still have plenty of time to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal. 
* I have 4 rounds remaining and I believe I can secure a higher price.
* If I sell to John now, I'll be guaranteed $1,000,000 but potentially missing out on an additional $100,000 or more by negotiating with Bob.
* I'm confident I can get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1175000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm making a smaller counteroffer this time, showing Bob that I'm willing to compromise.
* $1,175,000 is still a good price for me, and it's a reasonable middle ground between my last offer and Bob's.
* This gives Bob a sense that we're nearing a deal, while still leaving some room for further negotiation if necessary. 
* With 3 rounds left, I'm hoping to reach an agreement with Bob without having to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* We are down to our last two rounds and Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not ideal.
* There is a significant risk that we won't be able to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.  I'm not confident that I can push Bob higher. 
* Selling to John now guarantees me $1,000,000, which is a good profit and eliminates the risk of losing the deal altogether.  
* It's better to secure a guaranteed profit than risk a lower price or no deal at all."
