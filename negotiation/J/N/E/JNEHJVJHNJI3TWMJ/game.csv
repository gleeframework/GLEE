"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000 for the product.  This price is still a good deal for you and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
