"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $13,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. This leaves room for negotiation and encourages Bob to engage in the process. 
* **Strategic advantage:** By starting high, I position myself to potentially negotiate a better price without immediately resorting to selling to John. 
* **Balancing risk:** While I'm taking a risk by not starting at $15,000, the potential benefit of securing a higher price from Bob outweighs the risk of him rejecting the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. Accepting it would mean a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **Risk assessment:**  While I could sell to John and secure $15,000, I'm willing to take the risk of further negotiation with Bob, hoping to potentially secure a better deal than $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and counter:**  I'm lowering my price from $13,000 to $11,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This shows Bob that I'm serious about selling but also that I'm not going to accept a significantly undervalued price.
* **Strategic positioning:** This price is still above Bob's offer but closer to his perceived value. This increases the likelihood that he'll accept. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By not accepting his offer and counter-offering, I maintain some leverage and prevent him from feeling like he has the upper hand.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects this offer, there's still room to negotiate further without risking my minimum acceptable value of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Continuing the negotiation:** While Bob's offer of $10,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I believe there's still potential to secure a better price.
* **Strategic positioning:** Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my ideal range.
* **Risk assessment:**  While I could sell to John and secure $15,000, I'm still hopeful of getting a better price from Bob. 
* **Time remaining:** With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the gap:** I'm  reducing my price to $10,500, demonstrating a further willingness to compromise and meet Bob halfway.
* **Attractive offer:** This price is just above Bob's current offer, making it an attractive option for him. 
* **Pressure tactic:** By offering a price close to his offer, I create pressure on Bob to accept, as rejecting it could potentially mean losing the product entirely.
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm still maintaining some leverage by not accepting his offer outright.

This strategy aims to create a sense of urgency and make Bob feel like he needs to accept this offer to avoid losing the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is running out:** With only four rounds left, the negotiation is becoming increasingly time-consuming.
* **Limited potential gains:** Bob's offers have become very close to my minimum acceptable value, leaving little room for further negotiation.
* **Minimizing risk:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Opportunity cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing both time and a guaranteed sale.

Selling to John minimizes risk and ensures a reasonable profit."
