"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $600,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you and the market demand.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better price, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
