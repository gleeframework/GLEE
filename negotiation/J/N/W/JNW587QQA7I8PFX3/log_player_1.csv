Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Between Their Value and Yours:**  The $1,100,000 offer is between your valuation ($1,200,000) and Bob's ($800,000). This starting point acknowledges that the product has significant value to both parties.
* **Leaving Room for John:**  While you have the option to sell to John for your minimum, securing a deal with Bob above $1,200,000 would be ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While it's good that he's engaged in negotiation, accepting $900,000 would be a substantial loss compared to selling to John.  You have room to negotiate further and see if you can bring Bob closer to your target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true market value. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Demonstrate Flexibility:** Coming down $50,000 shows a willingness to negotiate, which might encourage Bob.
* **Still Above John's Offer:** The new price still allows you to make more profit than selling to John. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting ""market value"" emphasizes the product's worth beyond just Bob's perception.
* **Seeking Mutually Beneficial Outcome:**  This phrase aims to build rapport and frame the negotiation as a collaborative process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $950,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly moving towards your price range, $950,000 is still significantly less than your ideal selling price and what John is offering.  There's room for one more counteroffer to try and bridge the gap. If Bob doesn't budge significantly in the next round, it's likely more profitable to move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Let's make this simple: $1,000,000 and we have a deal.  This offer takes into account the points we've both raised and presents a fair value for this unique product."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tone:**  The language (""Let's make this simple"") suggests this is your best and final offer. 
* **Strong Justification:** By saying this price takes ""into account the points we've both raised,"" you acknowledge Bob's position while still emphasizing the product's value.
* **Clean Number:**  $1,000,000 is a firm, easy-to-understand figure that might make Bob more agreeable.
* **Above John's Offer:**  You're still leaving yourself room to profit more from Bob than selling to John immediately. 

**Next Steps:**  Be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't accept this offer.  While you've left some negotiating room, accepting anything below $1,000,000 might not be the most strategic move given John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're close, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. His last message suggests he's reached his limit. Accepting $975,000 would mean a loss of $225,000 compared to John's offer.  It's time to cut your losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
