"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a steal for a product worth so much more to you.  What do you say?",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,750,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for your product. It's a fair price considering what it's worth to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $850,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is still a great price for you, considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's make this happen.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,250,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be worth it in the long run.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still too far off from what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a good price, but $1,100,000 is still outside of my range. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but $1,000,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000, which is a significant concession on my part.  This is a fair offer for both of us, considering the value you'll gain from the product.  I'm starting to feel like we might not be able to agree, but I'm still open to discussing it further.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
