Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a steal for a product worth so much more to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high price, but leaving room to negotiate.  It's important to set a good starting point to maximize my profit. I'm also framing the offer in a way that highlights the value for Bob, making it more likely he'll at least consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,750,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for your product. It's a fair price considering what it's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to sell it for that low. I will counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $850,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is still a great price for you, considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

I've lowered my price from the previous round, demonstrating flexibility. However, I'm still above my minimum acceptable price.  This shows I'm serious about negotiating, but not willing to give away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,250,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be worth it in the long run. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's an increase from his previous offer, it's not enough for me to consider selling.  I'll counteroffer again, trying to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still too far off from what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I've lowered my price again, showing that I'm flexible and want to reach an agreement. However, I'm still above my minimum acceptable price. I've also highlighted that this price is fair for both of us, emphasizing the win-win potential."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a good price, but $1,100,000 is still outside of my range. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,500,000. I'll make another counteroffer, but I'm starting to feel like selling to John might be the better option."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but $1,000,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000, which is a significant concession on my part.  This is a fair offer for both of us, considering the value you'll gain from the product.  I'm starting to feel like we might not be able to agree, but I'm still open to discussing it further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm also subtly indicating that I'm considering selling to John, hoping to encourage Bob to make a better offer."
