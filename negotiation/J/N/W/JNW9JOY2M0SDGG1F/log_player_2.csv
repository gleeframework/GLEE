"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is looking to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $11,000 is better than John's price of $10,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, I'm only willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While $10,500 is tempting, I need a bit more to make this worthwhile for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,800. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $10,800.  This is still a good deal for Bob, as he's only paying $800 more than John's price.  There's a good chance that further negotiation will lead to a lower price, but it's not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice."
