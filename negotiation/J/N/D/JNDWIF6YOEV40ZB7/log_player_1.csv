"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit while also leaving room for negotiation.  This is a strong opening offer that demonstrates my confidence in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still lower than my initial asking price, and I believe I can get closer to my desired range with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to be flexible, but still maintains a profit margin that's closer to my initial goal."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is close to the price I'd get from John, I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price with Bob. There are still a few rounds left, and it's possible we can reach a mutually acceptable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but it's still a decent profit for me, and it shows that I'm serious about reaching an agreement. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. It's clear that Bob is not willing to meet my desired price point. While I would prefer to get a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. Selling to John ensures I get a decent return, and I can move on to other opportunities."
