Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, considering its value to me is much higher. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:** A friendly message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Not too aggressive:** I'm not immediately resorting to a ""take it or leave it"" attitude, as that might make Bob less likely to negotiate. 
* **Room for John:**  If Bob rejects, I can still fall back on John's $150 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below the $150 I could get from John.
* **Negotiation room:** I can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **John is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob break down, I can always sell to John, so there's no risk in rejecting Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** This offer is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's, showing willingness to negotiate but not caving in entirely.
* **Highlight fairness:** Emphasizing a ""fair price"" for both parties can appeal to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Urgency:** The phrase ""we can finalize this deal"" subtly adds a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Still above minimum:** The offer is above my minimum, so I'm not losing money if Bob accepts.

I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still trying to save some money. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum of $150.
* **Room for improvement:**  I can likely get closer to my minimum by making another counteroffer.
* **John is a safe option:**  If things don't work out with Bob, I can always sell to John for a higher price.

I'm confident I can get a better deal, so I'll continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. While I'm happy to negotiate,  $110 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $115? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small counteroffer:**  This counteroffer only raises the price by $5, showing a willingness to compromise without conceding too much.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  The message uses the phrase ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and cooperation.
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""close this deal"" subtly adds a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Still above minimum:** This offer remains above my minimum of $150, making it a potentially good outcome.

By keeping the counteroffer relatively small, I'm hoping to signal a willingness to reach an agreement while still maintaining a position of strength in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $115. I'm willing to pay $112 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum, but not enough:** While Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum, it's still below the $150 I could get from John. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a risk that Bob will continue to lowball me if I keep negotiating, and I might not be able to get a better price.
* **Opportunity cost:**  It's not worth the risk of losing time and potentially getting a lower price when I have a guaranteed $150 from John.

I'm choosing to sell to John, as it's the most secure option and ensures I get the maximum value for my product."
