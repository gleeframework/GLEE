Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I understand your budget considerations, however, the value of this product is truly significant and my initial offer was carefully considered.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,500,000 mark I need. John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price. It makes more financial sense to proceed with John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
