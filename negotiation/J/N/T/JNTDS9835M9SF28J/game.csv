"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm a bit tight on budget, but I really like the product. Can you meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest! While $9,000 is a bit below what I can accept right now, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer! I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000. However, I'm still a bit stretched on my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I see you're still keen on the product, and I appreciate that! While $9,500 is still a bit below what I can do, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, and it shows my commitment to finding a solution.  Let's aim for a final agreement,  how does that sound?",10500.0,Alice,5,
