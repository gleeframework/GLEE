"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm open to further discussion.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
