"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to negotiate but need to stay closer to the product's true value.  I'll counter with $900,000.  This gives you a significant discount while ensuring I receive fair compensation.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still too far below the product's true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and it ensures both of us get a good deal.",875000.0,Alice,5,
