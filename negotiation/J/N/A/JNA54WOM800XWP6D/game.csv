"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you at $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $130 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is significantly less than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a very fair price for this product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product but $95 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Could you do $75? That would work for me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you see the value in this product. $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85 if we can close the deal now.  This is my final offer.",85.0,Alice,5,
