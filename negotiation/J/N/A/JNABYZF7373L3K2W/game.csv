"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than my current budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  To move this forward, I could let it go for $1,275,000.  This feels like a fair compromise to me.  What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in the product, $1,275,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it reflects the fair market value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
