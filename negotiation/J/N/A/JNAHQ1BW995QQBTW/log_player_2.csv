Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $12,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. $11,750 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $12,250? It's still a good deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. What do you say?

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below $12,000. It makes more sense to cut my losses and buy from John at my target price."
