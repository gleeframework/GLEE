"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $9500 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9000. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm happy to meet you at $8750. This price is fair for both of us and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $8750 just yet. I'm willing to make a slight concession, though. I'll meet you at $8900. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",8900.0,Alice,5,
