Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This gives me some room to negotiate, but it's still a significant amount higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's ambitious:**  A higher price could lead to a better outcome. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer.

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for it immediately.  I believe I can still get a better deal. 

I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more than $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm not willing to go lower.  

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. This is the best outcome given the current situation."
