Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, there's a chance to earn an extra $1,000 by selling to Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $14,000 creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob, making it more tempting for him to accept. This price is still significantly higher than his perceived value ($12,000), giving you room for negotiation if needed.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything, as you can still sell to John at your desired minimum price."
