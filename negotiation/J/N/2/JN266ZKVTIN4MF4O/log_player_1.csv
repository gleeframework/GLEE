Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1,600,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate and try to secure a better price. I'm willing to engage in further rounds of negotiation before considering selling to John."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget, Alice. After considering your latest offer, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,470,000. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise and I hope we can move forward towards a successful transaction.
