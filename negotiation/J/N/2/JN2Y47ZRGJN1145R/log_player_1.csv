{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you.  It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer.  $9,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price, especially since I know John is willing to pay $10,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,800 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it just yet.  I'm going to try to get a bit closer to my original asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,800 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,200. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good value for the product. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10200}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,200, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower and we're running out of time. It's better to cut our losses and sell to John for $10,000.  This guarantees we make a profit and don't risk getting an even lower offer from Bob."
