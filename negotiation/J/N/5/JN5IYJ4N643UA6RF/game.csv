"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has value, I'm looking to invest closer to $1,000,000. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider coming down to $1,075,000. This offer takes into account the product's potential and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,075,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I still need to stay under $1,000,000.  Could you do $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While $950,000 is still below what I hoped for, I'm willing to accept $1,025,000 as my final offer. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
