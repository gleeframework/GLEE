"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  I believe it holds significant value for your operations. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to begin negotiations with an offer above your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Just Below Bob's Value:** The offer is slightly below Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000, aiming to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain. 
* **Open Communication:** The message emphasizes open dialogue and encourages Bob to share his perspective."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good profit, it's still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value of the product.  There's room for negotiation. Bob's offer suggests he's willing to pay a premium over our minimum, so we should aim higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I understand your perspective on the price, however, I believe my initial offer of $1,100,000 is a more accurate reflection of the value this product brings. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer still represents a significant saving for you compared to the value you place on it."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** We're showing flexibility by reducing the price, but not drastically. A smaller concession signals that we're serious about the higher end of the potential price range.
* **Value Emphasis:** We're reiterating the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him of the potential gain he stands to make.
* **Seeking Compromise:** The message frames the counteroffer as a path to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still think $950,000 is a more reasonable price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Trend:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating a willingness to pay more than his initial offer.
* **Profit Margin:**  While $950,000 is tempting, we're still aiming for a higher profit margin. We have room to negotiate, especially with several rounds left.
* **Time Pressure:** Bob might be more willing to concede as we get closer to the end of the negotiation period."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  It seems like we both see the value in this deal.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $1,000,000? This allows both of us to walk away feeling like we got a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer represents a clear compromise, meeting exactly in the middle of the previous offers. This can be a powerful psychological tactic, signaling a willingness to find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Simplicity:** A clean $1,000,000 offer is easy to understand and agreeable.
* **Win-Win Emphasis:**  Framing the deal as beneficial for both parties can make it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your suggestion, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $1,000,000. How about we meet at $975,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $975,000 is a significant profit margin, well above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While we could potentially squeeze out a bit more, the incremental gains are unlikely to outweigh the risk of Bob walking away.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation and allows us to move on to other opportunities."
