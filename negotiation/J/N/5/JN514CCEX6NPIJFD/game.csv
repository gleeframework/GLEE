"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  I believe it holds significant value for your operations. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I understand your perspective on the price, however, I believe my initial offer of $1,100,000 is a more accurate reflection of the value this product brings. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer still represents a significant saving for you compared to the value you place on it.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still think $950,000 is a more reasonable price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  It seems like we both see the value in this deal.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $1,000,000? This allows both of us to walk away feeling like we got a fair deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your suggestion, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $1,000,000. How about we meet at $975,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",975000.0,Bob,6,
