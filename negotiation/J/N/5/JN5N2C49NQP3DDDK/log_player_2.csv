Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I still need to make a profit. I'm offering the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on it and the value I place on the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm offering the product to you for $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good point to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Alice is signaling firmness:**  Her language (""final offer"", ""hope we can come to an agreement"") suggests she's unlikely to move much further. 
* **The price is reasonable:** $1,125,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $1,500,000 price.
* **Limited rounds remain:**  Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Alice away and leaving you with John's less favorable offer."
