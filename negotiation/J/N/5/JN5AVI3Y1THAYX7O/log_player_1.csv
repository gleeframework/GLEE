Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $70 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $70 is too low, and I know I can get more."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer again. While $75 is closer to what I want, I'm still holding out for a better price. There's still time to negotiate with Bob, and I don't want to settle for anything less than $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  I'm willing to come down to $82.  This is really my final offer.  I'm confident you'll find this to be a good deal."", ""product_price"": 82}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $82 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $78 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $78 is close, I'm going to sell to John.  I've had several rounds with Bob and haven't been able to get him to go higher than $78.  Selling to John guarantees I'll get my minimum asking price of $80."
