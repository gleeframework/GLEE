Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to you."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, I'm not losing money even if Bob rejects the offer.  Starting high allows room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""value and potential"" aims to frame the price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer will gauge Bob's interest and potential for a deal significantly above my minimum acceptable price."
