"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to me is at least $1200000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $1200000. Would you be willing to consider that price? I believe it's a fair offer considering your value for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I can't go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1400000. This is a compromise that still brings a significant profit for me, considering the product's value to me is at least $1200000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1400000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  How about we settle on $1300000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to meet you at $1350000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is at least $1200000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
