"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique and high-quality item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price, there's no potential to save money by negotiating.  You're guaranteed to get the product from John for the same price, so there's no reason to risk a negotiation."
