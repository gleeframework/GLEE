**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now at $11,250.** This is closer to Bob's desired price of $10,750 and within his budget of $12,000.
* **Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it also carries the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John at a higher price.**  
* **Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a decent price without risking a higher cost or losing the opportunity.**"
