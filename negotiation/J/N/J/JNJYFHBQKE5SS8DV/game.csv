"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at that price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to compromise at $13,500. This is a fair price, considering the value the product brings, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,
