"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I've got a product that I think you'd really appreciate. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a great price.  I'm asking for $125, which is a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You can get the product for $150 from John, and Alice is asking for $125. It's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John to save $25."
