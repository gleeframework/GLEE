Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still looking for a premium price for this exceptional product. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice is moving closer to my range, but I still think there's room for negotiation. I'll try another counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're getting closer to the price you're willing to pay, Bob. However, I'm still looking to maximize the value of this exceptional product. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make another counteroffer at $1,025,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being more in line with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

Alice is clearly committed to getting a price above $1,000,000. While I could push further, the difference is getting small enough that it's probably not worth the risk of losing the deal. Accepting at $1,025,000 still gives me a significant savings over John's offer."
