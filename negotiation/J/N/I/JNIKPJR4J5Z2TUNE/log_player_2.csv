"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you the product for $180. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is much higher than both your budget and what John is offering. It makes no sense to accept her offer."
