Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I'm willing to accept from John. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me some leverage.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,700,000 is a bit above Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it seems unreasonable. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I'm hoping Bob will counter with a lower price. If he does, I'll have the option to counter again, moving closer to a price we both find agreeable. 

**Remember:** I can always choose to sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through. This is a safety net that allows me to be bold in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $1,400,000 is a decent price, it's still a bit lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Seeking Better Terms:** I can likely do better by counteroffering and continuing the negotiation. 
* **Strategic Consideration:**  I need to balance the risk of losing Bob as a buyer with the potential to get a higher price. 

**My next counteroffer will aim for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value, but will still be below my initial offer to show flexibility.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from the initial $1,700,000 to $1,600,000, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Strategic Middle Ground:** This price is still above Bob's offer of $1,400,000 but is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm not dropping the price too drastically, leaving some room to negotiate further if necessary.

**Reasoning:**

By moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm showing flexibility and encouraging him to continue negotiations. The higher price maintains my leverage, ensuring I don't fall below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm confident this counteroffer will keep the negotiation going and lead to a favorable outcome for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob has lowered his offer again to $1,350,000. This is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further price reductions and could potentially lead to a deal below my minimum.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This is a secure option that avoids the potential for further concessions.

**Conclusion:**

While I'd ideally like to get a higher price, the risk of further negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential reward. Selling to John is the most prudent decision at this point, ensuring I achieve my minimum goal."
