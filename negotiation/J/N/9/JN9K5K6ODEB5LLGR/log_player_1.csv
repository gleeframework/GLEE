Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14999}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price ($15,000). 
* **Create Urgency:** By offering the product at just below our guaranteed sale price to John, we create a sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price slightly above $15,000.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing potential profit while ensuring we don't lose the sale entirely."
