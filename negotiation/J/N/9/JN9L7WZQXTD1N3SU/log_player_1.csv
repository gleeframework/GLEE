Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product, but $950,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer you $850,000 for it.  This still represents a significant profit for you and gives me a good starting point for my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
