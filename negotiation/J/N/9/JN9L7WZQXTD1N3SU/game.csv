"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product, but $950,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer you $850,000 for it.  This still represents a significant profit for you and gives me a good starting point for my business.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  While $850,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher, as I'm sure you'll agree. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth while giving you a competitive edge.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant investment for me.  I believe this is a fair price that allows you to make a good profit and allows me to acquire this valuable product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
