"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $8,500 right now. Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for the product's value. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10,500 is still outside of my budget.  I'm very serious about buying this product, and I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let's split the difference and see if we can make this happen.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to consider it. I can offer it to you for $9,500. This is the closest I can get to my target, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if this works for you.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  $9,250 feels like a fair compromise to me.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your initial offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer it to you for $9,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if this works for you.",9750.0,Alice,7,
