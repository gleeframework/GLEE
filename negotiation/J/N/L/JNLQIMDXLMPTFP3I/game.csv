"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I have to make a profit. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make at least $160. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I can do $130, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great price for a product like this!",130.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to accept $120, Bob. I think I can do a bit better than that. I can offer you $145, which is still a great deal, but I need to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",145.0,Alice,7,
