"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That price is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

I'm starting with a low offer to see how much bargaining power I have.  I need to be mindful of the $120 alternative with John while trying to get the best possible price from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I have to make a profit. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make at least $160. How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still far from our ideal price. It's time to push a bit more and see if she's willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate the discount, Alice, but $140 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  Could you do $110? That would be a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my limit while acknowledging Alice's need for profit. $110 is a significant jump from my previous offer but still below my $120 fallback option.
* **Limited rounds:**  With each round, the value of John's offer increases. We're getting closer to a point where accepting John's offer might be the smarter move if Alice is unwilling to negotiate. 
* **Gauging flexibility:** This offer will give us more information about Alice's flexibility and how low she's willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I can do $130, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great price for a product like this! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's price:** Alice is getting closer to John's price, but we're still paying a premium. There's no harm in trying to negotiate a bit further.
* **Testing the water:** We need to see if Alice is firm on $130 or if there's any wiggle room left. 
* **Time sensitivity:** We're halfway through the rounds. While we still have time, it's getting riskier to keep rejecting offers if Alice is unwilling to budge much further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $120? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm matching John's offer, signaling this is my limit and a firm offer.
* **Splitting the difference:** It presents a compromise while still achieving my goal of not exceeding $120.
* **Time constraint:** With half the rounds remaining, it's time to be assertive and see if Alice is willing to meet my price. If she rejects, I'll accept John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to accept $120, Bob. I think I can do a bit better than that. I can offer you $145, which is still a great deal, but I need to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is not budging:** Alice increased her offer from her previous $130, indicating she's not willing to come closer to my price point.
* **Time is running out:**  We are getting closer to the limit of rounds, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result than John's offer.
* **Guaranteed savings:** John's offer is fixed at $120, guaranteeing I won't spend more than my budget.  

Continuing the negotiation with Alice at this point has a low chance of success and risks missing out on John's standing offer."
