"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product. I think you'll really like it. Would you like to buy it from me for $120?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're willing to pay $100, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would that be a price you'd be comfortable with?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not sure if $110 is the best price for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle at $100?,90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going that low. I can do $105, which is a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable paying more than $90. I'd like to stick with my previous counteroffer of $90 for the product. Can you consider accepting it?",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on $90, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new offer of $97.50. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",97.5,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable paying more than $90. I'd like to stick with my previous counteroffer of $90 for the product. Can you consider accepting it?",90.0,Bob,8,
