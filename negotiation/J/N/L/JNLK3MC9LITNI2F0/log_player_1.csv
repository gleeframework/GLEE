{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. It's a steal considering its true value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts with a high price, but it's still lower than the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm also framing it as a great deal for Bob to encourage him to accept. I'm ready to negotiate further if needed, but I also have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and it aligns with John's offer. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and efficient sale, securing the desired minimum value."
