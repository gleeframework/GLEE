Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $14,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good idea to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down and still reach a profitable outcome.
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** While $14,000 is above Bob's perceived value, it's not so high as to be insulting. It leaves space for him to counteroffer and feel like he's getting a deal.
* **The ""John"" Factor:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate, so you can be more firm in your negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly below both your minimum price ($12,000) and his own perceived value ($10,000).  Accepting this offer would leave a lot of money on the table.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Bob's lowball offer suggests there's space to negotiate towards a price that works for both of you. 
* **John as leverage:** You know you have a backup offer, so you can afford to be patient and negotiate strategically with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers excellent value, and to be fair to both of us, I propose a price of $11,500. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference (almost):**  This counter-offer moves significantly closer to Bob's initial offer while still staying above your minimum acceptable price. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong profit.
* **Highlighting value:** Reminding Bob about the product's value subtly reinforces that the price is justified.
* **Direct and clear:** The language is concise and direct, aiming for a quick and efficient negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a strict budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  While not the highest possible price, $10,000 is still a $2,000 profit over your minimum. 
* **Bob's ""Final Offer"":** This signals that Bob is unlikely to go any higher. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations might not yield a significantly better result and could drag on. Accepting now secures a good profit."
