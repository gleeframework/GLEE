"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers excellent value, and to be fair to both of us, I propose a price of $11,500. What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,3,
