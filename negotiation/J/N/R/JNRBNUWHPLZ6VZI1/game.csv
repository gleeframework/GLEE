"Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a tempting price, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $15000. Would you be willing to consider $14000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value I'm placing on the product.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $16000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $16000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $15500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $15500 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $16200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",16200.0,Alice,5,
