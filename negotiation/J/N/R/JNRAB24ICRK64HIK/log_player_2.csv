Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In order to find common ground and ensure mutual satisfaction, I am proposing a revised offer of $925,000 for the product. This price allows me to maintain a reasonable profit while still being competitive with your offer. I believe this to be a fair compromise that respects both our interests. I look forward to your consideration of this proposal.

Alice's counteroffer is closer to your desired price, but it's still above your maximum value of $1,000,000. You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  You might be able to push Alice down to a price closer to your desired range of $900,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial solution. In light of your offer, I am pleased to counter with a price of $915,000 for the product. This figure strikes a balance between respecting your budget constraints and ensuring a reasonable profit for myself. I hope this proposal aligns with your expectations and facilitates a successful conclusion to our negotiations.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still above your maximum value of $1,000,000. There's a chance you could continue to negotiate, but it's getting risky.  At this point, it's better to take the guaranteed deal with John and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiations."
