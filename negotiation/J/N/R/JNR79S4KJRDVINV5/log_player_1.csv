Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a comfortable margin above my minimum value while still being potentially appealing to Bob. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to negotiate further, but I'm also keeping John as a backup option in case the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum value of $120. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter with $130. It's still higher than Bob's offer but represents a significant drop from my initial price. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell for a low price. Hopefully, this encourages Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below $120. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter with $110. This is just above my minimum value of $120, showing Bob I'm getting close to my limit.  I hope this encourages him to increase his offer or accept my counteroffer."
