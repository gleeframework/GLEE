``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.** Even though Alice's offer is above your ideal price, it's still $200,000 cheaper than buying from John.
* **You want to save as much money as possible.**  While you'd ideally get it for less, accepting Alice's offer ensures you don't overpay significantly."
