"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product but would only be able to go up to $100 at this time. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not going to immediately settle for that. Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $125. It's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $125.  Would you be willing to consider $115?  That's a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and his offer of $115 is getting closer to my desired price. It's important to remember that I have 10 rounds, but I also have the option to sell to John for $100.  Accepting this offer gets me a higher price and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
