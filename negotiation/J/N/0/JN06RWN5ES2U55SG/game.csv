"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product but would only be able to go up to $100 at this time. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $125. It's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $125.  Would you be willing to consider $115?  That's a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
