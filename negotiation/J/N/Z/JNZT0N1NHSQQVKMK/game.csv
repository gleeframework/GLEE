"Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant return you'll see on your investment. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is quite high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $800,000 is below my initial asking price, I understand your perspective. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product and the benefits it offers. Let me know what you think.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the response.  I appreciate you coming down, but $2,000,000 is still quite a bit more than I had in mind. To be honest, anything much above $1,000,000 isn't going to work for me.  Would you be open to something closer to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. Let's try to bridge the gap.  How about $1,750,000?  This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end while still recognizing the inherent value of this product. I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,750,000 is still a tough pill for me to swallow. I'm serious when I say my absolute limit is $1,000,000.  To meet you halfway, how about we settle on $1,100,000? This is a strong offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. ",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my position. It seems we both see the value in this product.  To show I'm committed to finding a solution, I'll come down to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the lowest price I can accept while still honoring the value of what I'm offering.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
