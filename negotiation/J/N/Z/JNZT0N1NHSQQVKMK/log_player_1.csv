Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the response.  I appreciate you coming down, but $2,000,000 is still quite a bit more than I had in mind. To be honest, anything much above $1,000,000 isn't going to work for me.  Would you be open to something closer to $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,750,000 is still a tough pill for me to swallow. I'm serious when I say my absolute limit is $1,000,000.  To meet you halfway, how about we settle on $1,100,000? This is a strong offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.
