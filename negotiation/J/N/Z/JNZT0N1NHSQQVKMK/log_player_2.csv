Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my position. It seems we both see the value in this product.  To show I'm committed to finding a solution, I'll come down to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the lowest price I can accept while still honoring the value of what I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to her lowest price of $1,500,000. This is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000 and above John's guaranteed offer. There's no point in further negotiation.  Buying from John guarantees you stay within your budget."
