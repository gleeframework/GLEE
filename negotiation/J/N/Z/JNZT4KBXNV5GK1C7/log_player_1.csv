Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price point. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could accept John's offer of $15,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. It positions the offer as a potential ""deal.""
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is my initial offer, the message's tone allows for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly price-sensitive. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can still sell to John for my minimum desired amount."
