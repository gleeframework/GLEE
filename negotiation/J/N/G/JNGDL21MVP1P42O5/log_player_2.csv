"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $13,500 is better than John's price of $15,000, Bob can likely get a better price.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm aiming to pay closer to $12,000 for this product. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay closer to $12,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $13,250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,250 is still a good deal for Bob compared to John's price of $15,000.  While Bob might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, it's likely not worth the time and effort. Accepting Alice's offer is the best option to get the product while still saving some money."
