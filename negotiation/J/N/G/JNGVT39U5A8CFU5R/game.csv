"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider a lower price?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that the price is a bit high for you, but I have to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $900,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that price?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $750,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I really need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great compromise, considering the product's value to you and my own needs.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $775,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe it acknowledges the product's value.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $925,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering its value to you and my own minimum requirements. Let's try to meet in the middle one more time.",925000.0,Alice,7,
