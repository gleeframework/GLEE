"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I believe my product is truly unique and valuable, and I'm willing to start with a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in your product, $900,000 is a bit high for me at this time.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product, which is still a significant investment. I believe this is a fair price, considering our respective valuations.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $750,000 is a good starting point, I still believe my product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the compromise.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $850,000, but I'm willing to come up slightly. I'd like to offer $800,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it and is still within a reasonable range for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $800,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer a price of $825,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product.",825000.0,Alice,5,
