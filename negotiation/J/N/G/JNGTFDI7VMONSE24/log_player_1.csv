Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob is willing to pay $120, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It's a clear signal:** This shows you are serious about selling and gives Bob a starting point for his potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still worth trying to get a better price.  You have the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob!  $90 is closer to what I had in mind, but how about we split the difference?  I'd be willing to go down to $95.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is very close to your desired price, and there's a good chance you won't be able to get a better deal. It's more beneficial to accept the offer at this point and secure the sale than risk further negotiation and potentially selling to John for a lower price."
