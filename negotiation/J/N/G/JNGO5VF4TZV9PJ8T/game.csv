"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $125 for this product.  Let me know if that's something you can work with.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110, which is a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $110 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $117.50. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",117.5,Alice,5,
