"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,000,000 at this time. This is my maximum price point, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1,000,000 is significantly less than what I value the product at, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm prepared to accept $1,125,000 for the product. This compromise allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
