"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $10,000. It's worth a lot more to you, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000 for the product?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is just too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we split the difference at $8,500? This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of this product to you while also allowing me to make a profit. Let's get this deal done!",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While $8,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $7,500.  This is a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a good price, and I get a fair deal for my investment. Let's close this now.",7500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close!  I can appreciate the need for a fair deal on both sides. Would you be willing to meet at $7,200?  That would make it easier for me to finalize the purchase.",7200.0,Bob,6,
