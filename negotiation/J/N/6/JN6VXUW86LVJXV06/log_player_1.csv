Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe it's a fair price considering its potential. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1500000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in your product but would need to see a lower price. I'd be willing to pay $1000000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept such a low price right away. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value this product, $1250000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1150000. This is my final offer, let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I'm going to counteroffer one last time before considering John's offer.  I want to see if I can get a bit closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer.  To be honest, $1,150,000 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway at $1,175,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
