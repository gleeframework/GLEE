"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. $1400000 is a bit below my minimum.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'd be happy to accept $1750000 for the product. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and it reflects my desire to make this deal happen.  Let me know what you think.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
