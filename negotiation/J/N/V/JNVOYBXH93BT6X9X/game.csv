"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. It's a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a good profit and you to still get a solid return. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is a fair price considering the value we've both discussed. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this transaction quickly.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
