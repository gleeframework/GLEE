Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a good profit and you to still get a solid return. Let's see if we can find common ground here.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
