Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a better price than his initial rejection, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $1,200,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
