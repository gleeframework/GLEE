"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? That gives you a good deal while still allowing me to get a reasonable price for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. How about $1,000,000? This is a fair compromise that allows you to get a good deal while still providing me with a decent price.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
