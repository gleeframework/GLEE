"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $9,000. It's a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item at a discount, and I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better deal. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her or create an opportunity for her to make another offer.  You always have the option to buy from John for $10,000 as a last resort."
