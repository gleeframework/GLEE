Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm happy to discuss a price that feels fair for both of us. How does $1,100,000 sound?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible without going below our own minimum of $1,200,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for some negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle somewhere above our guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.
* **Confident but Open Tone:** The message is positive and emphasizes mutual benefit, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation."
