Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since John acts as a guaranteed backup offer at $1,200,000, Alice's goal is to see if she can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $1,150,000 creates a win-win scenario *if* Bob is persuaded. Bob gets a $150,000 discount from the price John is willing to pay, and Alice makes a $150,000 profit.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message suggests room for negotiation, leaving the door open for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price slightly high."
