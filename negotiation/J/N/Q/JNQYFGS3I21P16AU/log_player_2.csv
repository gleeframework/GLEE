Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I'm glad we're making progress. Considering the value of the product and aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose a price of $10,700 for the product. This is a fair compromise that respects both our interests.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Alice's offer of $10,700 is very close to Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. 
* **Potential for Counteroffers:** While Bob could try to counteroffer again, the risk is that Alice might not budge further, and then Bob would have to buy from John at $10,000. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that's only slightly above Bob's preferred amount. It's a good compromise to avoid the potential of a breakdown in negotiations."
