"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,600,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and then some.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,600,000 and $1,800,000, which would be $1,700,000. I think this is a fair compromise.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
