"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a competitive price. I'm asking for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you, and allows me to earn a fair profit. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,1,
