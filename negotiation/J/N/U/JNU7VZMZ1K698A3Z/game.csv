"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to you. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial asking price is significantly higher than I had in mind. I'm prepared to offer $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,900,000. This reflects a more realistic valuation while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the adjustment, but that price is still too high for me.  I can go up to $700,000 if you're willing to work with me on this.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I'm willing to continue negotiations. However, to reach an agreement that works for both of us, I need to see a more substantial increase. I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, reflecting the true value of the product.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but the gap between our valuations is still significant. To show I'm serious, I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute maximum I'm prepared to spend.",800000.0,Bob,6,
