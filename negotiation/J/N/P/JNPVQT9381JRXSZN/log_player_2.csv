# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'll choose option 2: Reject the offer and make a counteroffer. I don't want to pay $200, and I know I can get it from John for $150.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since I know I can get the product from John for $150, I'll make a counteroffer to Alice that is just below that price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $140 is a bit too low for me, how about we meet in the middle at $170?

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Since Alice's last offer was $170, I'll make a counteroffer that's a bit lower than that. I'll try to get as close to $150 as possible.
