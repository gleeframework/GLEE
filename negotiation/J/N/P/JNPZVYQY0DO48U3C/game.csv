"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but I have to make a living. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit closer to my minimum. How about we settle on $1100000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise on my end.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit too far from my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. How about we settle on $1050000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $975000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at this price?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $975000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. How about we settle on $1075000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $990000, but I think that's as high as I can stretch. Can we meet at this price?",990000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet at a price that works for both of us, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. How about we settle on $1090000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1090000.0,Alice,9,

"I understand that you're making a last concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $995000, but that's my absolute maximum. I'm starting to think that buying from John might be a better option.",995000.0,Bob,10,
