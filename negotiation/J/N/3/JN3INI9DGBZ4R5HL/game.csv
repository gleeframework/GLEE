"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $220 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your perspective, but $60 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle â€“ would you consider $180?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $180 is still pretty far from what I had in mind. I could possibly go up to $70, but that's as high as I can go.",70.0,Bob,4,
