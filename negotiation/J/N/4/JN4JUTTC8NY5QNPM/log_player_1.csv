"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss the sale of this product with you. I'm confident it holds immense value for someone like you.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000.  Given its potential, I believe this is a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening:** Starting high ($2,000,000) establishes a strong position and leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Justification:**  While high, the opening emphasizes the ""potential"" value, not just the current worth to Bob. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This first offer will help gauge Bob's level of interest and flexibility. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John guarantees at least $1,500,000 provides a safety net, allowing for bold negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is simply too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000, which is a significant amount and still a good deal for you given the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is already above his perceived value of the product ($1,200,000). This indicates room for negotiation.
* **Below Guaranteed Price:** Accepting $1,300,000 would be settling for less than John's guaranteed $1,500,000. 
* **Early Stage:**  It's still early in the negotiation. Rejecting now allows for exploration of higher offers without appearing overly eager."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,000,000 represents the high end of its value, I understand your perspective on $1,300,000. To find middle ground, I propose $1,800,000. This reflects the product's true potential while acknowledging your initial offer."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Coming down by $200,000 from the initial offer shows flexibility without drastically decreasing the price.
* **Justification:** Reframing the price around the product's ""true potential"" keeps the focus on its higher value rather than settling towards Bob's perceived value.
* **Anchoring:** Keeping the price well above both Bob's offer and the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John maintains a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,800,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000, which is a fair price considering both our perspectives.  Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Trend:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a strong interest in the product and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Above John's Price:** While tempting, $1,400,000 is only slightly above John's guaranteed offer. There's still room to push for a better deal with Bob.
* **Limited Rounds:** With several rounds remaining, it's worth continuing negotiation to explore if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I see your offer of $1,400,000 as a serious step, and I'm motivated to get this done.  To meet you closer, I'm proposing $1,650,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value and brings us closer to a deal."", 
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession:** Dropping to $1,650,000 is a substantial move designed to signal flexibility and a strong desire to close the deal.
* **Midpoint Positioning:** This price is now the exact midpoint between the previous two offers, reinforcing the idea of a ""fair compromise.""
* **Time Pressure:** As rounds progress, subtly introducing time pressure (""get this done"") might encourage Bob to move closer to the asking price. 
* **John as Leverage:** While not explicitly mentioned, the knowledge of John's offer allows for a confident stance even with a significant price reduction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $1,650,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matches John's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $1,500,000 now matches the guaranteed amount from John. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate for a potentially small gain above $1,500,000 carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or stalling the negotiation.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids further time investment and potential delays with a new buyer. 
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting Bob's offer at this price demonstrates goodwill and the potential for future business."
