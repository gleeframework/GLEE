"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss the sale of this product with you. I'm confident it holds immense value for someone like you.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000.  Given its potential, I believe this is a fair offer.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is simply too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000, which is a significant amount and still a good deal for you given the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,000,000 represents the high end of its value, I understand your perspective on $1,300,000. To find middle ground, I propose $1,800,000. This reflects the product's true potential while acknowledging your initial offer.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,800,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000, which is a fair price considering both our perspectives.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I see your offer of $1,400,000 as a serious step, and I'm motivated to get this done.  To meet you closer, I'm proposing $1,650,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value and brings us closer to a deal.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $1,650,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
