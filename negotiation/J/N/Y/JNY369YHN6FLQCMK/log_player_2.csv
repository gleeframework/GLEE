"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $170. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $60 for the product. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** Starting extremely low ($60) leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly below both my budget and Alice's valuation. 
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** This low offer will help me understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I always have the option to buy from John for $80, so I'm not pressured to accept a price I'm uncomfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $60 is too low, I could come down to $140.  I'm confident you'll find it's worth that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice dropping to $140 shows some flexibility, but it's still way above my budget. It makes sense to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate the effort. I'm willing to go up to $75, but that's really my limit.  Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** I've increased my offer significantly to show Alice I'm serious but still staying well below her last offer. 
* **Firm but Fair:** By stating my ""limit,"" I'm hoping to encourage Alice to make a more substantial move while signaling I'm not willing to be pushed too far.
* **Nearing the Walk-Away Point:**  As the price gets closer to John's offer, I need to be prepared to walk away if Alice isn't willing to negotiate further."
