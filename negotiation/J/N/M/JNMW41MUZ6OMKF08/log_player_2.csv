"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll experience.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'm not interested in paying $2,250,000 for the product, that's $750,000 more than I'm willing to pay. I will reject Alice's offer.
