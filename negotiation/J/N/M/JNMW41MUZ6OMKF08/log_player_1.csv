Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll experience.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I want to aim significantly higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" and ""significant return on investment"" to justify the high price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While the initial price is high, the message leaves room for negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts. This allows Bob to counter-offer and potentially meet somewhere in the middle.

By starting high, I increase the chances of:

1. **Bob accepting the initial offer:** If Bob is very eager or perceives the value to be even higher, he might accept immediately.
2. **Negotiating a higher final price:** Even if Bob negotiates, the starting point anchors the discussion at a higher value, potentially leading to a final price above the $1,500,000 backup offer."
