"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $500,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time I've invested in it. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position. How about we settle at $650,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I'm still not convinced that $650,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm offering it to you for $725,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",725000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $680,000?  That's a significant jump from my last offer.",680000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable with $680,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering it to you for $700,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",700000.0,Alice,7,
