"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000.  This is a strong opening position that gives me room to negotiate. I'm also factoring in the risk that Bob might reject the offer. If he does, I can still get my minimum of $8,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm going to reject it.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. There are still 8 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product at a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. He's come up to $8,500, which is a significant improvement from his initial offer.  While I'd ideally get closer to my original asking price,  it's getting late in the negotiations and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  $8,500 is a good price and I'm happy with that outcome."
