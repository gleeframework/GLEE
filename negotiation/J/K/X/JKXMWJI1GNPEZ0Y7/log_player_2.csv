{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $10,000 is a good price, but Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate and could potentially get a better deal.  It's always worth exploring options before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming to get a significant discount.  He's offering $8,000, which is a 20% reduction from Alice's initial offer. This shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal and is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still within his budget and has time to negotiate further.  He should reject this offer and continue trying to lower the price.  He's shown he's willing to push for a better deal, and Alice has demonstrated she's willing to negotiate.  There's still room for both sides to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing that he's willing to compromise.  Offering $8,500 is a good middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's current offer.  This move shows he's serious about reaching an agreement while still trying to get the best possible price."
