Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it's a significant markup from my minimum price of $150, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will find the value of the product to be higher than $200, but I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum price of $150.  I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm countering with $175. This is a compromise from my initial offer of $200, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer of $100. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum price, so it's in my best interest to accept.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that we'll reach a higher price, and I risk losing time and potentially the deal altogether.  Selling to John for the same price is a viable alternative, but accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure the sale and avoid the uncertainty of a potential counteroffer."
