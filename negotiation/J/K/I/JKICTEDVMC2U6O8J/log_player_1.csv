{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you're interested in. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is slightly higher than what Bob values the product at, but it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer, but it also gives him a sense that I'm open to a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  While I'm open to negotiation, $7,000 is significantly less than what I value the product at. I'll try to counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target price.  If that doesn't work, I'm willing to sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and I pay $8,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,250 is closer to my minimum price of $10,000 than his previous offers. While it's still not ideal, it's a reasonable compromise. Accepting his offer ensures a sale, and I can always use the additional funds for something else."
