Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  That gives us both a fair deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
