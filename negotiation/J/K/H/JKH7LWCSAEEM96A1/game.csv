"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind. This product offers a lot of value, and I believe a price closer to $16,000 is more reflective of that.  What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $14,000 for the product. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
