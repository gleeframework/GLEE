"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. This is a fair price considering my value for the product and allows for some room for negotiation.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product can bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1050000 is closer to my target, it's still a bit too high. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product, and it's the highest I'm willing to go.  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $975000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. $975000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it and reflects a compromise from both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $900000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $925000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",925000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility in negotiating. While $925000 is getting closer, it's still a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to offer $875000 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value we both place on the product. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're willing to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $875000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $912500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal.",912500.0,Alice,9,
