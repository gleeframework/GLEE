"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to make this deal work for both of us.  This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,000,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's compromise at $900,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal. I'm confident you'll find this product to be well worth the investment.",900000.0,Alice,5,
