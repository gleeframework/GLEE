Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm not going to accept Bob's low offer yet. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to see if we can bridge the gap."

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing him and potentially getting a lower offer from John."
