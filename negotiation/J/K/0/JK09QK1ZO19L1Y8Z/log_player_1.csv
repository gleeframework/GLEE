"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value.  This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I'm also leaving room for potential negotiation in the coming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500.  This is still higher than Bob's initial offer, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to compromise and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower. While it's tempting to accept, I'm still holding out for a better price.  John is a safe option at $8,000, but I'm going to try one more round to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

This is my final offer. It's my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to go lower.  I'm hoping Bob will finally accept, as he knows he can't get a better deal from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm running out of rounds.  It's not worth risking losing the deal entirely to try and squeeze out just $100 more. John's offer is guaranteed, so I'll take it."
