Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, knowing that it's likely higher than Bob's initial perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. 
* **Enthusiasm:**  The message expresses confidence in the product's value and subtly tries to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies a willingness to negotiate,  encouraging Bob to counter-offer if he's interested.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still keeping the negotiation open and allowing for a potential deal."
