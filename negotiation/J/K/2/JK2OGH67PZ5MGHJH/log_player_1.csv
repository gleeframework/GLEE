"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is lower than my minimum price of $12,000, I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I'll send a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand that $10,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $12,000, so I'm offering the product for $11,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9500 for the product. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $9,500 is even lower than my initial offer of $12,000, but it's still below my minimum price of $10,000. Since I don't want to sell the product to Bob for less than my minimum price, I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round.

Additionally, since Bob's offer is lower than John's offer of $10,000, I'll choose to sell the product to John instead of continuing to negotiate with Bob.
