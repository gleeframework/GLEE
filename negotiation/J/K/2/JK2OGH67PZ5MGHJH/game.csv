"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $12000, so I'm offering the product for $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9500 for the product. Would you be willing to consider this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
