"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for a bit lower. Could you do $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're close, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay a premium for this product, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,5,
