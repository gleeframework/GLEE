"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:**  This allows for a potential compromise without me immediately dropping to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message sets a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.** While it's closer, it's still not worth it to me to sell at that price.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price.
* **Selling to John is a Safety Net:** If the negotiations fail, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? I'm confident this price is fair considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 11250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing willingness to negotiate further.
* **Midpoint Compromise:**  I'm suggesting a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,250 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Final Offer?**  Bob's claim of a ""final offer"" is a tactic. I'm not convinced that he won't go higher.
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:** I believe I can still get a better price by counter-offering and continuing the negotiation.
* **John is a Strong Backup:** If this round fails, I can always sell to John for a much higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $10,750 is closer, it's still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but still staying above Bob's offer. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the benefits of the deal for Bob, emphasizing the ""fairness"" and potential for a ""win-win"" outcome.
* **Creating Urgency:**  I'm suggesting a ""make this happen"" attitude to encourage Bob to consider closing the deal.
* **Maintaining Margin:**  Even at $11,000, I'm still making a significant profit compared to my minimum of $15,000. This keeps John's offer a strong backup option if Bob continues to refuse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $10,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to make a profit while staying within my budget. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  We've reached a point where Bob is unwilling to budge significantly.  His repeated insistence on $10,750 suggests we're at an impasse. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're approaching the middle of the negotiation rounds.  Continuing to counter-offer may lead to a deadlock and waste valuable time.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's final offer.

It's better to secure a guaranteed profit with John than to risk getting stuck in a lengthy negotiation with Bob that may not lead to a satisfactory outcome."
