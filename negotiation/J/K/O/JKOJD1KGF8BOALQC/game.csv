"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, considering its potential value. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a significant investment for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,050,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $975,000 for the product. This represents a substantial investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product.  I'm confident we can find a way to make this work for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,
