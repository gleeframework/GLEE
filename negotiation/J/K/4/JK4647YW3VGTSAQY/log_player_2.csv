# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your business.  I'm asking for $1,200,000 for it, which is a significant discount from its true potential value.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **You save money:**  Accepting Alice's offer saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Potential Value:**  While Alice claims the product is worth more, that doesn't guarantee you'll actually make a profit. It's better to secure a good deal within your budget."
