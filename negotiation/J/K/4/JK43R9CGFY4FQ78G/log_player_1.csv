{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $11,500 is more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The price is below Bob's perceived value of $12,000, giving him incentive to negotiate. 
* **It shows confidence:**  It's not a lowball offer, showing that you believe in the product's value. 

This strategy allows you to potentially secure a higher price while leaving room for negotiation if Bob is willing to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than your minimum desired price of $10,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  You can still negotiate with Bob and potentially get closer to your desired price.
* **Avoid settling too low:**  Accepting Bob's offer would mean selling for less than your minimum, which is not ideal.
* **Explore other options:**  While you're negotiating with Bob, you can also consider if selling to John for $10,000 is the better option."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10,500? This would be a great deal for both of us, as it's still below your estimated value and above my minimum. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer within your range:**  $10,500 is still above your minimum of $10,000, so it's within your acceptable range.
* **Compromise and meet in the middle:** This offer is halfway between your previous offer of $11,500 and Bob's offer of $9,000, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  The message highlights the benefits for both parties, reminding Bob of the value of the product and demonstrating your willingness to find a solution.

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between your expectations and Bob's offer while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $10500 is a bit too high. How about $9500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to your minimum, it's still below it. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Maintain leverage:** You can potentially negotiate a higher price by counter-offering.
* **Avoid settling too low:**  Accepting Bob's offer would mean selling for less than your minimum.
* **Consider selling to John:** While negotiating with Bob, remember that you can sell to John for $10,000, which is more than Bob's current offer.

This strategy allows you to potentially secure a higher price, avoid selling below your minimum, and explore the option of selling to John if the negotiation with Bob doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway.  While $9,500 is closer, it's still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference, how about $10,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's right at my minimum and still within your budget. I believe it's a good compromise that allows us to both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer is a final compromise, meeting you at your minimum while still offering a fair price to Bob.
* **Focus on Fairness:** The message emphasizes the fairness of the offer, highlighting how it benefits both parties.
* **End the Negotiation:** This offer is intended to end the negotiation, as it's likely the closest you'll get to your desired price without risking losing the deal.

This counteroffer is a strategic move aimed at finalizing the deal and securing a price that is both acceptable to you and within Bob's budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $10000. How about $9200? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tricky situation. Bob's offer is still below your minimum, and continuing to negotiate might lead to a long and unproductive back-and-forth. While you could make another counteroffer, it's becoming clear that Bob is unwilling to meet your minimum. 

At this point, selling to John for $10,000 is the most sensible decision. It:

* **Guarantees your minimum:** You secure your desired price without further negotiation.
* **Saves time and effort:**  You avoid further rounds of potentially unproductive negotiation.
* **Minimizes risk:** Continuing with Bob could lead to a prolonged negotiation with no guarantee of a satisfactory outcome.

Selling to John ensures you achieve your minimum goal and avoids the risk of potentially losing a better offer by holding out for more from Bob."
