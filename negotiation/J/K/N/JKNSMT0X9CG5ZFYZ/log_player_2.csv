# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  While Alice's offer is still higher than the product's worth to her, it's significantly lower than John's price. 
* **You save money by accepting.** Buying from Alice saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John."
