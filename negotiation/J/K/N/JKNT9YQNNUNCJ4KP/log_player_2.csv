(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. There's plenty of room for negotiation and it's unlikely her offer is the best I can do. I'll make a counter offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $8,500, but that's as low as I can go. This is a great product, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down, but I'm still aiming lower. I'll reject this offer and see if I can negotiate further."

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5

# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we do $8,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is getting closer to a price I'd accept, I'm still holding out for $8,000. I'll reject this offer and counter with a slight increase from my last offer to show I'm willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're right, I am very interested and I appreciate you working with me. How about $8,100?"",
""product_price"": 8100
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we do $8,200? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to get as close to her value as possible. At this point, the difference between her offer and my ideal price is small enough. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of the negotiation failing and having to buy from John at a higher price."
