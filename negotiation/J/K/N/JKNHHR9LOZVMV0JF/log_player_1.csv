Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 (John), you can aim high with Bob. Starting at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your minimum.
* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting that this is an exclusive offer creates a sense of urgency and value.
* **Open-ended question:**  ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter-offer and engage in negotiation, rather than just saying ""yes"" or ""no."" 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always lower the price, but you can't go higher once an offer is made.  Remember, your fallback is selling to John for $10,000, so any amount above that is a win."
