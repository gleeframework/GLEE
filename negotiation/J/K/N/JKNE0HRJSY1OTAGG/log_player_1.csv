"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is closer to my minimum value ($15,000) than Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive framing:**  The message is friendly and highlights the value of the product.
* **Room for negotiation:**  This offer leaves space for negotiation, allowing Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I have 10 rounds to reach a deal, and there's still room to negotiate with Bob. I want to see if I can push him closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is an option:**  While $15,000 is my ideal outcome, I'm not rushing into selling to John just yet.  I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  It's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but keeping the negotiation open by offering a counter-proposal.
* **Middle Ground:**  My counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,500). This shows that I'm willing to compromise but not cave in.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is friendly and emphasizes finding a solution that works for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9800. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $9,800 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. While it's getting closer, it's not yet within my desired range.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** We've only had four rounds, and there are six more left. I have time to push for a better price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  While I'd prefer to get a higher price from Bob, John's offer of $15,000 is a guarantee that I won't lose out if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,800 is still too far below what I need.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $10,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight compromise:** I'm moving a little closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility without dropping too far below my minimum.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize why $10,250 is fair.
* **Seeking a solution:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a way to find a compromise that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  Bob's offer of $9,500 is still well below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  We've only had six rounds, and I have four more chances to reach a better price.
* **John's offer is a secure option:**  However, I am starting to feel a bit concerned about Bob's willingness to compromise. I am willing to risk another round or two with Bob, but I am now more seriously considering John's offer as a backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to think we might be too far apart on this. I really value this product and need to get at least $10,000 for it.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is presented as my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to decide.
* **Firm but Fair:**  $10,000 is still below my ideal price but is a significant compromise from my previous offers, showing my willingness to close the deal.
* **Limited Time:** We're getting close to the end of negotiations, highlighting the urgency of a decision. 
* **John's Offer:**  I am still aware that I can sell to John for $15,000, making me less hesitant to walk away if Bob doesn't agree."
