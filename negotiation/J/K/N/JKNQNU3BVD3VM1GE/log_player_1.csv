Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $12,000. I believe it's a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to your business."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my valuation and my initial offer.  It's too early to settle for such a low price. I should counter, but still leave room for negotiation.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer.  How about we agree on $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $9,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $7,000?  That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob is slowly moving towards a more reasonable price, but it's still less than I want. I'll try one more counter-offer before considering John's offer.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
