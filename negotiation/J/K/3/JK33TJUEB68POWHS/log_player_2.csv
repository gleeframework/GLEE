"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is a good price, there's a chance you can get it for even less.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a good discount.  I'm assuming Alice is motivated to sell and may be willing to compromise a bit.  This is a good starting point to see if she's open to negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than John's offer, it's still higher than my initial counteroffer of $8,000. I'm hoping that I can continue to negotiate and get a better deal. I've already shown Alice that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right, so there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved a bit closer to my initial counteroffer.  I'm going to split the difference and see if she'll budge further.  I'm still hoping to get the price down to $8,000, but I'm willing to compromise slightly."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still too high.  I'm going to continue negotiating, hoping to close the gap further. I'm still confident that I can get a better price, as I've shown that I'm willing to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate. I'm going to increase my offer slightly, but still keep it below her last offer.  This shows I'm serious about getting a deal, but I'm not going to overpay.  I'm hoping this will get us closer to a final price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still too high. While the offer is closer to my last counteroffer, I'm going to continue negotiating. I'm committed to getting the best deal possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but still wants to get more than my preferred price. I'm going to meet her halfway this time, hoping to close the deal.  If she rejects, I'll have to seriously consider buying from John as we're running out of time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the final round and Alice has come down to $9,125.  While I'd prefer to get it for a bit less, the risk of not closing the deal with Alice and having to pay John $10,000 is too high. Accepting Alice's offer saves me $875 compared to buying from John."
