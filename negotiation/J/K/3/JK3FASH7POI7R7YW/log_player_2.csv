"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's opening offer is already a discount. This suggests there might be room for further negotiation to lower the price.  While buying from John is an option, it's worth seeing if I can get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I was hoping to get it for a little bit less. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Ambitious but Realistic:**  Starting with a significantly lower offer ($9,000) tests Alice's flexibility. It's still within a reasonable range, considering my $12,000 limit.
* **Polite and Engaged:** The message remains positive and expresses continued interest in the product. 
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:**  This counteroffer gives us space to negotiate upwards towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get the product for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, moving almost halfway from her initial offer.  However, $10,500 is still above my ideal price point. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concessions:** This counteroffer shows Alice that I'm willing to move closer to her price, but I'm not giving up on a good deal. 
* **Targeting a Midpoint:** Aiming for $9,750 splits the difference between her last offer ($10,500) and my previous counteroffer ($9,000).
* **Maintaining Confidence:** The tone remains positive and suggests that this price is a reasonable solution for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,250. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has explicitly stated that this is her final offer. Pushing further might make her walk away from the deal.
* **Significant Savings:** $10,250 is a $1,750 discount from the original price and $1,750 less than John's offer. That's a good deal.
* **Time Investment:**  We've already spent five rounds negotiating. Continuing might not yield a significantly better price and risks losing the opportunity."
