"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:** My message is positive and focuses on the benefits to Bob.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** This price is still lower than what the product is worth to me.  
* **Flexibility:**  I'm open to negotiating, but I'm confident that I can get a price closer to my goal of $1,000,000. 

**Important Notes:**

* **John:**  The existence of John as a backup buyer gives me leverage in this negotiation.  I'll use him strategically as a fallback option if the deal with Bob falls through. 
* **Rounds:**  I'm aware of the limited rounds. This will influence my negotiation strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. I am willing to pay $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but it's still below my target.  
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  I have leverage because John is willing to pay $1,000,000. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I will counteroffer with a price closer to my target in the next round.  
* **Risk Assessment:**  While $950,000 is tempting, I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above your budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  That's a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's the average of my last offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000). This shows willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Above My Target:**  $1,075,000 is still above my minimum of $1,000,000, allowing me to potentially secure a better profit.
* **Positive Tone:** My message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, keeping the negotiation friendly. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I'm pushing for a deal closer to my desired outcome while acknowledging Bob's budget constraints. 

**Important Note:**

* I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I'm hopeful that I can secure a better deal with Bob through continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still working within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that I might not get a better offer, and I could end up selling to John for a lower price. 
* **Time is Limited:** We're already in round 4, and with only 6 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to hold out. 
* **Minimizing Loss:**  Accepting this offer allows me to maximize my profit while minimizing the risk of getting a lower price or running out of negotiation rounds. 

**Conclusion:**  Given the circumstances, it's strategically advantageous to accept Bob's offer."
