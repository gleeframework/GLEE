"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, giving me room to negotiate. It's important to show confidence and aim high in the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for a price that significantly undervalues my product.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000. This is a significant concession, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm also not willing to give away the product for a song."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not high enough.  I need to try and get closer to $1,200,000.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm making another concession, but this time it's a smaller one. I'm lowering my price to $1,150,000, hoping that this will be enough to entice Bob into accepting the deal. We are getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I still believe I can get a little more.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can squeeze out a slightly better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

I'm making a final push to get as close to my minimum acceptable price as possible.  I'm lowering my price to $1,125,000, which is a small concession but hopefully enough to persuade Bob to accept.  I'm running out of time, so I need to strike a balance between getting a good price and closing the deal."
