You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. There are 9 more rounds to work with, so you have plenty of opportunity to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, aiming to show my serious intent to buy while establishing a lower price point. This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation but also incentivizes Alice to consider it, as it's closer to my maximum budget than her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than my desired budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate, as there are still 7 rounds remaining. I can potentially get a better deal by pushing for a lower price, especially since Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round, but still staying below Alice's latest offer. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise but also demonstrates that I'm serious about purchasing the product. I'm aiming for a price closer to my limit, and with multiple rounds remaining, there's still room for Alice to lower her price further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget, there's still room for negotiation, and I have 5 rounds left.  By rejecting and making another counteroffer, I can potentially push for a price even closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final push with a counteroffer slightly above my maximum budget, but still lower than Alice's latest offer. This shows Alice I'm willing to meet her halfway and suggests I'm ready to close the deal soon. With only 4 rounds remaining, it's important to show commitment while remaining within a reasonable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within my acceptable range and closer to my maximum budget.  With only 3 rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate is too high.  There's a good chance we won't reach an agreement, and I'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product at a decent price, avoiding potential further negotiation pitfalls."
