"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product,  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be interested in purchasing it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 is significantly below its market value.  I could consider a price of $1,000,000 for a quick sale.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product holds value, but I need a price that aligns with my budget. Would you consider $700,000?  This offer represents a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your budget considerations.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $850,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  Would you be willing to agree on $750,000? I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",750000.0,Bob,6,
