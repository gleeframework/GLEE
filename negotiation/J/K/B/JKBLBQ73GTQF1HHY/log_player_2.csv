"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can do better than $1,150,000.  Since John is willing to sell for $1,000,000, you have a baseline to compare offers against. You should try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for potential compromise. This offer also demonstrates your seriousness about buying the product while trying to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what John is offering.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to $1,000,000. There's still room for Alice to lower her price and you to potentially make a counteroffer closer to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise. However, it's still significantly lower than Alice's offer, keeping the pressure on her to come down in price. This offer keeps you in the negotiation while demonstrating your desire to find a mutually acceptable deal."
