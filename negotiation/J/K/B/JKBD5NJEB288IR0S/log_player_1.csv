{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, while still securing a significant profit above your $800,000 minimum.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:**  This price reflects confidence in the product's value but avoids being overly aggressive, which could make Bob walk away.
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects this offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price."
