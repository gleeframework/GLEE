Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $9,700 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still reflecting the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,700 is within my budget of $10,000 and represents a good compromise. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee of a lower price, and I risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting this offer saves me time and ensures I get the product within my budget."
