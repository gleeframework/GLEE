"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price for the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a high but reasonable offer. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to subtly remind Bob of its worth. 
* **Confident Tone:** The language is confident and direct, suggesting that the offer is serious and well-considered. 

By starting at your desired price, you establish a strong position and set the stage for the rest of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,000,000. Would you consider reducing the price to $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is quite good, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. There's a decent chance we can negotiate a higher price, especially since we have 8 rounds remaining and the security of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value this product brings is truly significant.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $975,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** By only reducing the price by $25,000, we demonstrate that we're serious about the product's value and not willing to make drastic concessions.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** This counter-offer aims to find a compromise between Bob's offer and our desired price, encouraging further negotiation. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  We again subtly highlight the product's worth to reinforce its desirability to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $975,000 is beyond my budget. Could we possibly negotiate down to $950,000? I believe this would better align with both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now offered $950,000 twice.  This suggests it might be close to his upper limit. However, we still have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and walking away with an extra $50,000 is significant. We'll try to push him a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your position. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle on $962,500?  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while recognizing your budget constraints."",
""product_price"": 962500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're now splitting the difference between his previous offer ($950,000) and our last counter-offer ($975,000).  This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Firm but Fair Language:** We're using language like ""fair compromise"" and ""solution"" to position this as a win-win scenario.
* **Still Above Target:**  We're still aiming to get closer to our $1,000,000 target, even if we might accept slightly less in the end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise. Considering the ongoing discussion, I would like to propose a price of $955,000. I hope this aligns closer to what you are willing to accept while respecting my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $955,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $955,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we're now past the halfway point in the negotiation.  The increments are getting smaller. It's time to show Bob we're willing to walk away and take John's offer if we don't see more significant movement. This calculated risk might incentivize him to make a more serious offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to negotiate, but I need to be upfront. I've received a very strong offer from another buyer who's ready to meet my asking price. To be fair to you, I'm willing to consider your best and final offer right now. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll need to move forward with the other offer."",
""product_price"": 965000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Urgency and Competition:** By mentioning the other buyer, we create a sense of urgency and scarcity. Bob now knows he's not our only option.
* **""Best and Final"" Tactic:**  This signals that we're nearing the end of our negotiation window and are serious about accepting the other offer.
* **Slight Concession:**  We're still slightly lowering our price to $965,000 (a compromise between our previous offer and our target). This leaves a little room for Bob to potentially meet us halfway.

This strategy puts the ball firmly in Bob's court. He now has to decide if he's willing to increase his offer significantly or risk losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your situation and respect the offer you've received. I'm willing to go up to $960,000 for the product. This is my final offer, considering my budget constraints and the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** While not our ideal price, $960,000 is only $40,000 less than our guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  
* **Final Offer:**  Bob has stated this is his final offer, and with only two rounds remaining, it's unlikely he'll go much higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Pushing further risks losing the deal entirely. Accepting this offer secures a very good profit with minimal risk."
