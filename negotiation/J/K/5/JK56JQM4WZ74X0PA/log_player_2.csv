# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny for you. Let me know what you think!

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you still have room for negotiation. You can likely get the price down further. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is still a bit lower than my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which I think is a fair compromise.  Let's work together to make this happen!
