{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming to get as much as possible from Bob. It also emphasizes the value the product holds for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,500 is more than the minimum I'd accept, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is still a bit lower than my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which I think is a fair compromise.  Let's work together to make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
