"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your ideal price.** You're aiming for a price below $12,000, and $9,500 is too high. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better price by counteroffering. 
* **Buying from John is a backup.**  If the negotiation with Alice fails, you have a guaranteed option to purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm interested, $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's still a good deal for you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to your ideal price.** While still above your target, $9,000 is a significant improvement from $9,500. 
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield much more.** You've already shown a willingness to pay $8,500, so pushing for a lower price might lead to a stalemate or even push Alice to cancel the deal entirely.
* **Buying from John is still a backup.**  If you're unhappy with the deal, you have the option to purchase from John.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer at $9,000 is a good compromise. It saves you $3,000 compared to buying from John and gets you closer to your ideal price."
