**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's unlikely he'll reach a number I'm happy with.  At this point, accepting John's guaranteed offer is the most logical choice to avoid further negotiation and secure the best possible outcome for me."
