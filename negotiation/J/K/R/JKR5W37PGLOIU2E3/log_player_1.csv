"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him room to counter without immediately rejecting. I'm aiming for a compromise and a quick deal, but I'm also keeping in mind my minimum value of $12,000 in case I need to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. While I'd prefer to close the deal, it's too risky to accept at this point.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is too low for me. Let's split the difference - how about $10,250?  I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to be closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to your asking price, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,750? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept anything below my minimum.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $10,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
