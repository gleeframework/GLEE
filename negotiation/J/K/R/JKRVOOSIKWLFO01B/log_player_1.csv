"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than the product's value to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get as close to my desired price of $12,000 as possible while also leaving myself room to counteroffer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to close the deal quickly, selling for $10,000 is significantly below my minimum price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering $12,500. This is a good compromise, as it's still higher than Bob's offer, but closer to my minimum price. I'm hoping this will incentivize him to accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still not enough. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a higher price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for my minimum price if this deal falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm offering $11,500. This is a small compromise from my last offer, but I'm hoping it will be enough to convince Bob.  I'm getting closer to my desired price, and I'm confident I can get a good deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm also aware that selling to John would guarantee me my desired price. I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob, so I'm going to reject his offer and counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11300}
```

I'm offering $11,300. This is a small compromise, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible. We're getting close to a deal, and I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This offer is only $150 below my minimum. I'm going to accept Bob's offer. This is a good deal considering the time spent negotiating and the potential of not getting a better offer from Bob. I also need to consider the risk of losing the deal entirely and being forced to sell to John for my minimum price."
