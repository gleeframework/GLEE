Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a great opportunity for you."",
""product_price"": 950000 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, it's always beneficial to explore if I can exceed that.
* **Understanding Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so offering it below that wouldn't make sense.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $950,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob is interested but wants to discuss the price.
* **Strong Initial Offer:** This high initial offer emphasizes the value of the product and sets a strong starting point. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a higher price than his perceived value while having the safety net of John's offer."
