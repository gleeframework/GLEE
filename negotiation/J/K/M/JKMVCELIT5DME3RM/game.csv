"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $95 for the product.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $102.50? That's still a great price for a product of this value.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I've been considering the value of the product and I believe $97.50 would be a fair price for both of us. I hope this proposal works for you.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While I value your business, $97.50 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $100.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I've given your proposal some thought. I would like to suggest a price of $98 for the product. It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but still within my budget.",98.0,Bob,6,
