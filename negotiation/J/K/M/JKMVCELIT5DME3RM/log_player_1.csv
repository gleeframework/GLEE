Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price.  $95 is still below my minimum, and I have more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $102.50? That's still a great price for a product of this value."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I've been considering the value of the product and I believe $97.50 would be a fair price for both of us. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my minimum, I still have rounds left and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While I value your business, $97.50 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $100.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've given your proposal some thought. I would like to suggest a price of $98 for the product. It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but still within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  We're now in round 6, and Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not confident I can get him to agree to a price I'm happy with in the remaining rounds.  It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John."
