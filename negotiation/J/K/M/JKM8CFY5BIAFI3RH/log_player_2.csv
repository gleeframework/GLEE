"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'm not interested in paying $2,200,000 for the product. That's way above my budget of $800,000. I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. Since I'm interested in buying the product, but I'm not willing to pay the initial price of $2,200,000, I'll offer $1,200,000. 

{""message"": ""I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While that price is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to move closer to your range. How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000?  This reflects the true value of this product and its potential for your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice's new offer of $1,850,000 is still too high for me. I'm not willing to pay that much. I'll reject her offer and make another counteroffer. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. Since her previous offer was $1,850,000, I'll try to meet her halfway between that and my initial counteroffer of $1,200,000. Let's see... $1,850,000 - $1,200,000 = $650,000, and halfway between those two numbers is $1,525,000. I'll offer that to Alice.

{""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we try $1,525,000?"", ""product_price"": 1525000}"
