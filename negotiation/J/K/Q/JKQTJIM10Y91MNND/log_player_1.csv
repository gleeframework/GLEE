{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value but still allows me to make a profit.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and positive in my message, emphasizing the mutual benefit of the deal. This helps to create a good rapport and encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Strategy:**  By offering a lower price initially, I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to accept. If he rejects, I'll have room to negotiate further, or I can always turn to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and also lower than the initial offer I made.  Therefore, accepting his offer would result in a significant financial loss for me.  It's better to reject his offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $1,050,000?  That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his offer. It's still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 but shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a friendly but firm tone. I acknowledge his offer but reiterate my need for a higher price. I also highlight the product's value to emphasize the deal's potential benefit for Bob.
* **Strategy:**  This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving while still protecting my interests. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, it's still below my desired outcome.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I believe I can still negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,025,000.  That's getting closer, but we're still a bit apart.  I'm willing to make one last concession.  I'll take $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering $1,075,000. This is a compromise that splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer.  It's still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer and highlighting the benefits for both of us. I'm also creating a sense of urgency by suggesting this is my final concession, which could encourage Bob to accept.
* **Strategy:** I'm trying to reach a mutually agreeable price while maintaining a reasonable profit for myself. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in accepting this offer, as it's a good compromise."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to make one last concession, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Please consider this offer.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to take a significant loss.

It's a better financial outcome for me, even though I would have preferred to sell to Bob if we could have reached a mutually agreeable price."
