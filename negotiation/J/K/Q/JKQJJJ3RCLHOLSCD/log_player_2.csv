{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Explanation:**

Alice is getting very close to your target price, but still has not reached it.  At this point, it's becoming clear that the negotiation with Alice is going to be very time-consuming and might not result in a price you're happy with. You've already had 10 rounds of negotiations, and Alice might not budge any further.

It's important to remember that your goal is to save as much money as possible.  Buying the product from John at $800,000 ensures a quick and clear transaction, saving you the potential time and stress of further negotiation."
