"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, as it's worth $120 to you! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $100 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to pay closer to $85. This would be a fair price for both of us, given your valuation of the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $85 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm confident you'll still get a great value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $95 is better than $100, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely secure a price closer to his desired $85 by continuing to counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $85. It's a fair price, considering your own valuation of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I can't go lower than $90. This still gives you a great deal on the product, and it's closer to my valuation.  Let's try to find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** At $90, the product is still within Bob's budget of $120 and offers a good savings compared to buying from John.
* **Negotiation progress:** Alice has shown a willingness to come down from her initial price.  
* **Risk:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk that Alice will walk away or Bob might run out of rounds and be forced to buy from John at a higher price. 

While Bob might prefer to pay $85, accepting the $90 offer seems like the most practical choice at this point."
