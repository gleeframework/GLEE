"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, as it's worth $120 to you! Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to pay closer to $85. This would be a fair price for both of us, given your valuation of the product.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $85 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm confident you'll still get a great value at this price.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $85. It's a fair price, considering your own valuation of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I can't go lower than $90. This still gives you a great deal on the product, and it's closer to my valuation.  Let's try to find common ground here.",90.0,Alice,5,
