"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to see a bit more flexibility on the price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile.  I'm confident this product will be extremely valuable to you, and I'm ready to negotiate further.  Let's meet in the middle at $925,000.  What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $925,000. How about we try $887,500?",887500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $887,500 still isn't quite where I need to be.  I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Let's try $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you and allows me to get closer to my desired outcome.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement on this round.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll compromise at $875,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value to me.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to negotiate. However, $875,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. Given that we've both made concessions, I'm willing to go down to $890,000.  This compromise shows my commitment to reaching an agreement, while still ensuring I can achieve my goals.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal in the next few rounds.",890000.0,Alice,7,
