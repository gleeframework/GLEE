Round 5
Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, her latest offer is still $50,000 above your maximum price. You have the option to buy from John for $800,000, guaranteeing you stay within budget. It's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations with Alice when you have a guaranteed, acceptable offer elsewhere."
