{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $2,000,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the price of $1,600,000 falls short of what I consider fair given its potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,850,000. This is a significant investment for you, but I am confident it will pay dividends for years to come."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,850,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,700,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground, and I believe this price is a reasonable compromise. I'm eager to hear your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer. While we're getting closer, there's room to negotiate further with Bob and aim for a price closer to $1,800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've given this some thought, and to find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,775,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your position."",
""product_price"": 1775000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** By presenting this as your ""final offer,"" you create a sense of urgency and signal that you're firm on the price. This can encourage Bob to accept, especially since it's a significant increase from his last offer.  We're aiming for a price close to the midpoint between his last offer and our previous one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,775,000. I'm willing to pay $1,650,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is getting closer to our acceptable range, but we're still above John's offer. We've presented a ""final offer"" to try and push Bob closer to our desired price. It's now time to show some flexibility, but we need to be careful not to drop too low too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position and understand you're looking for a fair deal.  To move this forward, I'm willing to accept $1,700,000. Let's get this done."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're now getting close to the halfway point of the negotiation and need to incentivize Bob to close the deal.  By matching his offer from round 4, we show flexibility and a willingness to reach an agreement.  This price is still a significant profit above John's offer and keeps us in a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,700,000, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,675,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,675,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly trying to maximize his value, but this offer is too good to pass up. Accepting secures a $175,000 profit over John's offer with minimal risk of losing the deal at this point. It's always better to close a good deal than to risk losing it for a potentially slightly better one, especially with only two rounds left."
