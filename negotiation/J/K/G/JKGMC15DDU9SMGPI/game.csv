"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product!  I know its value to you is significant, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  My initial offer is $1400000.  What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $1300000. This represents a significant investment on my end and hopefully, we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1300000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This still allows for a substantial profit for you, while also enabling me to reach my target price.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident the product will be very valuable to me, but I need to be within my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1325000. This price is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve our objectives.  Let's settle this deal so we can both move forward.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
