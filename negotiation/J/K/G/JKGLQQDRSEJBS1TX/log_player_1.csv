Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $149. I know you'll find it valuable, so I wanted to give you a chance to grab it before I list it publicly!"",
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, our goal is to see if we can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below our guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and value. It suggests the price is a special deal and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $149 is our initial offer, there's a slight chance Bob might try to negotiate further. This leaves us a small buffer to potentially still get more than $150. 

**Important Note:**  If Bob were to counter-offer, we'd need to re-evaluate if his offer is higher than $150 to decide whether to accept."
