"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and willing to pay a premium. This first offer sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to accept such a huge loss.  It's worth risking a few more rounds to see if we can reach a more agreeable price. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I'm hoping that Bob will see it as a sign of my willingness to negotiate. I'm also getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I believe this could be a reasonable point for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable, and I'm not willing to risk further losses.  I've already offered to sell to him for $1,250,000, and he's still not coming close.  At this point, it's best to cut my losses and sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
