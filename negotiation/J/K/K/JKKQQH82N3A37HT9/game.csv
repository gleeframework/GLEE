"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make you an initial offer of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  To be honest, $775,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to settle at $700,000?  I think that's a fair offer considering both our positions.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to compromise again and offer $725,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value and my costs. I think it's a fair price considering our previous discussions. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $725,000 is still pushing my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle at $712,500? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",712500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $712,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $720,000.
