"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its potential, but also allows for a fair return on my investment.  I'm confident you'll see the value in this opportunity.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you have a backup option with John for $1,200,000.  There's a chance you could get a better price from Alice by rejecting her initial offer."
