"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

You can get a better deal, so rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is the best course of action."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be.  Let's see if we can close this deal.

You are still over your budget, but you can likely get a better price. It's worth trying one more counteroffer."
