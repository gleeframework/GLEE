"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
