"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $7,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Would you be willing to consider my offer?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $8,500? It's still a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's closer to my minimum desired price. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,000 and $8,500. How about we try $7,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a decision soon.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we settle on $8,250? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my minimum desired price.  Let's see if we can close this deal. ",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7,900, but that's the maximum I can afford. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a good deal.",7900.0,Bob,6,
