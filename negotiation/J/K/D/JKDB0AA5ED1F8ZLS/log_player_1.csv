I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This gives me a good margin above my minimum price of $12,000. I believe it's a fair starting point, but I'm willing to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'd prefer to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500.  This is a compromise, and I'm hopeful Bob will see it as a reasonable middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up a little, and I'm happy to accept his offer of $12,200. It's a bit less than I was hoping for, but it's still above my minimum price and it avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
