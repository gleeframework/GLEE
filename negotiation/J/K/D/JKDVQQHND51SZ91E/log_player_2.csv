Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $118? It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $118 is within my budget and represents a good compromise. While I could continue to negotiate, there's a chance she might not budge further. Accepting the offer secures the product at a price I'm comfortable with, and I can avoid the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and ultimately having to buy from John at a higher price."
