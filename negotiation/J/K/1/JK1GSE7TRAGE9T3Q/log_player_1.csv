Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($120) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Reasonable Offer:** $150 is a reasonable starting point, considering I don't know Bob's value for the product.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is friendly and highlights the potential value of the product.

This strategy allows for a good starting point, and allows me to see if Bob is interested at all in the product. If not, I can always fall back on John's offer of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the recommendation. However, I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Still Higher:** While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still above the value I'd get from selling to John.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. 
* **Avoiding Loss:**  Selling to John would guarantee $120, but I'm willing to risk a little more to see if I can get a better deal with Bob. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and propose a counteroffer closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I'm open to negotiating, $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $140? I think this would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground between my initial price and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is friendly and highlights the benefit of reaching a mutually acceptable price.
* **Appeal to Fairness:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair solution, which can be more persuasive than simply rejecting Bob's offer.

By offering a compromise, I aim to encourage Bob to accept the deal. If he rejects it, I can then re-evaluate my options based on how determined he is to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $135 for the product. This still allows me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value of the item. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $135 is only $15 away from my initial asking price of $150, and it's significantly higher than John's offer of $120.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Further negotiation could lead to a lower price, and there's no guarantee that Bob will accept any further counteroffers.
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, potentially leading to a deal that is not worth the additional hassle.

At this point, accepting Bob's offer ensures a good profit and minimizes the risk of getting a lower price."
