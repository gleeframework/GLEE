"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is within his budget, it's likely he can get a better price. There are still 9 rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This shows he's serious about getting a good deal, but it's still within the realm of reason given the product's worth to Alice.  He's hoping this will encourage Alice to consider a serious negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While $1,050,000 is a better price than the initial offer, there's still room to negotiate.  He has 7 rounds remaining to potentially get a lower price. Buying from John at this point would be a loss compared to where he is now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing he's willing to compromise.  However, he's still pushing for a price closer to his target. The middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's offer might encourage Alice to start considering a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While the offer of $1,075,000 is better than John's offer, there's still room to negotiate. He has 5 rounds left to try and get a lower price before he has to make a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering Alice's minimum acceptable price.  He's essentially putting the ball in her court.  Alice has two options: accept and get her minimum value, or reject and risk Bob walking away to John. With only 4 rounds left, the pressure is on Alice to make a decision."
