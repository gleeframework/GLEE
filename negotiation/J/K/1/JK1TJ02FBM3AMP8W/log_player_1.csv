{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $850,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident it's a great deal, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above the minimum I'm willing to accept, but allows room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, which may encourage him to accept.  I'm keeping the door open for a counteroffer, while still expressing confidence in the initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm going to reject Bob's counteroffer and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to achieve our goals. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd ideally like to sell the product for closer to $800,000, Bob's offer of $775,000 is getting closer to my minimum price.  There's a risk that further negotiation might lead to a lower offer or a stalemate. It's better to take this offer and secure the sale,  especially since I have the option of selling to John for $800,000 if the deal falls through."
