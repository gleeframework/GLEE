"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is looking to pay no more than $80 for the product. Alice's offer of $110 is too high.  It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the product for as low a price as possible. While $100 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's target of $80. Rejecting allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85.  It's the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $85, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that low of a price. I'm willing to make one more offer to you. I can offer the product to you for $95. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer is $95, which is still higher than Bob's target of $80. Since this is her final offer, it's better for Bob to go with John's offer of $80 to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
