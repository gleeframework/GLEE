Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This price is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.  If he rejects this offer, I'll be ready to counter-offer, but if he accepts, it's a good deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a slight concession from my previous offer, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum value. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is getting increasingly lower, and I'm not willing to risk going any lower.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer and will pay my minimum value of $15,000.  It's time to stop negotiating with Bob and sell to John."
