Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $95. I believe you'll find it to be a great value at this price."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to haggle, while still securing a significant profit.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Offering it at $99 or $100 might seem too aggressive and could make Bob less likely to accept. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
