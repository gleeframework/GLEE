"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I think a starting price of $11,500 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being flexible.  $11,500 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is exactly in the middle between his maximum price and Alice's offer. This is a good starting point for negotiation, as it shows Bob is serious about buying but also wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and call it $11,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,250 is still within Bob's budget and closer to his ideal price than John's offer.  At this point, it's better to accept the offer and avoid further negotiation that might risk a higher price or losing the deal."
