"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $600,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $600,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can get closer to my desired value.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $600,000 simply isn't enough.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is still a good price considering the value of the product, and it gives you plenty of room to profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,000,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low. I'm not willing to sell for anything less than $1 million. Let's see if we can get closer to that number in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm firm on my $1,000,000 offer. This product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm confident you'll make a significant return on your investment. If you're serious about this deal, let's close it at this price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
