"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

We're still significantly below John's offer. It's time to nudge Bob closer to our acceptable range."
