I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a fair price considering it's worth $120 to me and $80 to him. I'm leaving room for negotiation but also ensuring I make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm countering Bob's offer with $100.  This is a compromise, meeting him halfway from my previous offer. I'm hoping this price is enticing enough for him to accept while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is too low for me. I'm not willing to go any lower, and it's clear we're not going to reach an agreement. Since John is willing to pay my minimum price of $120, I'm going to sell the product to him."
