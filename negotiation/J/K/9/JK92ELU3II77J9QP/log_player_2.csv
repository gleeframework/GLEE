"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $12,000.  I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($12,000 < $15,000).**
* **Accepting Alice's offer saves you $3,000 compared to buying from John.** 

Even though Alice is getting a good deal, it's still a better deal for you than buying from John."
