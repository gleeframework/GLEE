"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a good starting point and allows for room to negotiate if Bob is interested but not willing to pay my initial asking price.  I'm also aware that if Bob rejects, I can always sell to John for $100, so I have a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than $100, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to try to get closer to my initial asking price of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135 as my counteroffer. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price, $127.5 is a significant improvement over the $100 I could get from John. It's also getting close to my acceptable minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
