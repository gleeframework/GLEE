Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I value your offer, $1200000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider at this time. I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which reflects a significant compromise on my end. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product and allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.
