"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'd like to make a serious offer at this price point. Can we meet in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I value your offer, $1200000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider at this time. I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which reflects a significant compromise on my end. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product and allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
