{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value of the product but still leaves room for negotiation if he rejects it.  It's also lower than what you could get from John, giving you some wiggle room to potentially get a higher price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less to me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still far below my minimum desired price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target by rejecting his offer and proposing a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,300,000? This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and leaves some room for us both to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get a better price. I believe I can still get closer to $1,300,000 by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you halfway - how about $1,275,000?  This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product and allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,225,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum desired price, but it's still not enough to justify delaying the sale.  It's clear that we're not going to agree on a price that I'm comfortable with.  Since I can sell to John for $1,500,000, it's time to move on and secure that deal."
