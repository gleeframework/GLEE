"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired outcome. This gives you room to negotiate down while still potentially securing a price above your minimum.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial high price will help gauge Bob's interest level and give you an idea of his perception of the product's value. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $12,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell at any cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation. He jumped straight to his perceived maximum, indicating he might be willing to go a bit higher. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $18,000 is closer to my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle? Would you consider $15,000?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** You're showing flexibility by coming down from your initial price. 
* **Middle Ground:**  $15,000 represents a compromise and might be appealing to Bob if he's genuinely interested.
* **Profit Margin:** This price still gives you a significant profit margin above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $13,500 is a solid offer. It's a significant amount above your minimum acceptable price and a good compromise from Bob's initial offer. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental gains and risks alienating Bob. He's clearly interested but also has a budget in mind. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of Bob losing interest or finding an alternative.  It's better to secure a good deal now than hold out for a potentially marginally better one later."
