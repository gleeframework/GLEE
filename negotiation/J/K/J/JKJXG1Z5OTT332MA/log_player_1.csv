{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you've expressed interest in. I'm asking for $110 for it. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I believe I can't exceed $85 for it. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $85 is better than nothing, I'm holding out for a better price. It's still early in the negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95 to meet you halfway.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 95}
