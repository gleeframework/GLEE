Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving me with a decent profit. I'm hoping that Bob values the product at a higher price and is willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $160 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $175. It's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows him I'm willing to negotiate, but I still want a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $165, which is only $10 less than my last counteroffer.  It's time to accept the offer.  While I could try to squeeze out another few dollars, it's not worth the risk of Bob walking away and me being forced to sell to John at a lower price."
