"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I'm on a tight budget and $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $8,500? It's a great price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $7,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,750. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $8,200? It's still a good deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",8200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, this is getting close to what I can afford.  How about $7,900 and we have a deal?",7900.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close as possible to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,900. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $8,100? It's still a good deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",8100.0,Alice,7,
