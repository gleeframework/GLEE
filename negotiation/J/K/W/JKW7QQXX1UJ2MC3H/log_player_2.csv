"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I know will be incredibly valuable to your business.  Given its potential for growth and the market conditions, I'm setting the price at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and it allows me to achieve my desired outcome. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000) but still within your budget. However, you can potentially save more by negotiating.  There's room for a counteroffer that could be beneficial to both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $900,000. This price would still be quite profitable for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000. This price still provides you with a significant value, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's keep the conversation going. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial $1,000,000 offer to $950,000.  This is a significant concession and represents a good deal for you. While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise or you'll end up buying from John for a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer at $950,000 saves you $50,000 compared to John's offer."
