"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I know will be incredibly valuable to your business.  Given its potential for growth and the market conditions, I'm setting the price at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and it allows me to achieve my desired outcome. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $900,000. This price would still be quite profitable for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000. This price still provides you with a significant value, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's keep the conversation going.",950000.0,Alice,3,
