Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000). This allows room for negotiation and gives me a stronger starting position.
* **Positive Message:** I'm using positive language to pique Bob's interest and make him feel valued.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm prepared to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, but I have a backup option with John if the negotiation doesn't go as planned."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.**  I'm not going to make more money by continuing to negotiate, and there's a risk that Bob will walk away entirely.
* **Selling to John is the same outcome.** Selling to Bob for $8,000 gives me the same amount of money as selling to John. 
* **Minimizing risk:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids any potential for a longer negotiation that might end with no sale at all."
