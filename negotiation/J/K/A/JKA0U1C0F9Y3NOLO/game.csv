"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity, but $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $15,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer that meets you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you'll get from the product, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm happy to pay $16,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I'm placing on it, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $16,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell the product for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $17,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",17500.0,Alice,5,
