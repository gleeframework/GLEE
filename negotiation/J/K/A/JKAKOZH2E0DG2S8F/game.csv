"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than the value it holds for you.  Let's get this deal done!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,000,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit. Let's work together to get this done.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a good compromise that's fair to both of us. Let's make this happen.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price. However, $1,050,000 still falls a bit short of where I need to be. Let's meet in the middle at $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
