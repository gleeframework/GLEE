"Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $2,300,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but my initial price reflects the true worth of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, however, $1,500,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,700,000. This is a fair compromise, given the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer.  $1,700,000 is a significant investment for you, and I want to ensure we can find a solution that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to meet at $1,800,000? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your initial offer.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,800,000 is still stretching my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,750,000, but that's my absolute limit. Let's find a compromise and close this deal.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
