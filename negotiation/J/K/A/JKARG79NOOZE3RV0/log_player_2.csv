"Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Since the product is worth $80 to you, and you can get it from John for $80, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. You can get the same product for the same price from John."
