Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can gauge his interest and adjust my counteroffer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is my minimum value, I'm not willing to accept it immediately. Bob's offer shows he's willing to negotiate, so I'll counteroffer to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm offering $135 as my counteroffer. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my initial value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is insistent on $120, which is my minimum value, but I'm not seeing much potential for further negotiation.  Selling to John for the same price ensures a guaranteed sale and avoids further rounds of negotiation."
