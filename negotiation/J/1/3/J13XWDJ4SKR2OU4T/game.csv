"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,050,000. This price takes into account your concerns while still reflecting the product's true value to me.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
