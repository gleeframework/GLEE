"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it.  While I think the product is great, $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $115?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Would you be willing to go to $120?  That would be a good deal for both of us and I'd be happy to buy it then.",120.0,Bob,4,
