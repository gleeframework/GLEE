# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can likely get a better price than $130.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before going to John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it.  While I think the product is great, $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $115?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a very fair price considering the value you'll get from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

You can still do better than $125.  You're close to a good deal, so it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice a bit more."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Would you be willing to go to $120?  That would be a good deal for both of us and I'd be happy to buy it then."", ""product_price"": 120}
