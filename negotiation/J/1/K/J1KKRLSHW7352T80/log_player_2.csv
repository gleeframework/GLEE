Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're working with a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your transparency, Bob, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $990,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","This is a tough one! Alice is clearly trying to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible. Let's analyze:

* **Accepting:**  $990,000 is a good price, saving you $210,000 from John's offer. 
* **Rejecting:** You could push for slightly less, but risk Alice walking away. 

Since Alice has said this is her final compromise, there's a real chance she won't budge further.  

**Decision:** I'd recommend accepting the offer at $990,000. It's a strong price and avoids the risk of losing the deal.
