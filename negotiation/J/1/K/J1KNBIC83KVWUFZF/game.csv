"I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this price is still a good value for the product, but I'd like to see some room for negotiation.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I recognize you see the value,  $1,800,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $2,100,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $2,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $2,050,000. I think this is a fair price for the product, considering its value and my budget.",2050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $2,075,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end.",2075000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $2,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $2,050,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'd like to try to find a mutually beneficial solution.",2050000.0,Bob,6,
