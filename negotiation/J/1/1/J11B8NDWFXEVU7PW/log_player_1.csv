Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000 is a good starting point:**  It's higher than Bob's valuation, giving me a decent profit. 
* **The message is friendly and encouraging:**  It emphasizes the value of the product without being pushy.

**Reasoning:**

This strategy balances the following:

* **Maximizing my profit:**  I want to earn as much as possible, so I'm starting with a price above Bob's valuation.
* **Securing a sale:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale with John.  I want to give Bob an opportunity to buy, but I don't want to risk losing too much money.
* **Building a relationship:**  By being friendly and not being too aggressive, I might be able to build a positive relationship with Bob, even if he doesn't buy this time."
