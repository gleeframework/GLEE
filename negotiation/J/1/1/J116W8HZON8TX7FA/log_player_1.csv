Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $130 is higher than Bob's $80 valuation, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  It's still above your minimum $150 threshold, so you're not giving it away.
* **It's a friendly message:**  A friendly approach can make Bob more likely to engage.

It's important to remember that this is just the first offer, and the negotiation may evolve depending on Bob's response. You may need to adjust your strategy based on his counteroffers and your willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly below my minimum threshold of $150.  While I want to make a sale, accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't accept an offer below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $120 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference at $110? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is still well below my minimum threshold of $150. While I appreciate his continued interest, I'm not willing to risk losing a significant amount of money on this sale.  John is a guaranteed buyer at a price that meets my minimum, making selling to him the most sensible option."
