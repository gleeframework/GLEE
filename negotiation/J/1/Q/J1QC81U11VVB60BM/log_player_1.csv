"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Positive framing:**  My message is positive and emphasizes the value Bob will get from the product.
* **Room for negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to assess Bob's willingness to pay. 
* **John as backup:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he is willing to negotiate, which is a good sign. 
* **Seeking a higher price:**  I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. 
* **John is a backup:**  I still have the option of selling to John for $15,000, which gives me leverage during the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** I'm offering $11,000, which is still above Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains my desired profit margin.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product brings him. This helps justify the price. 
* **Openness to further negotiation:** My message indicates I'm open to further discussion, but I'm not willing to go below $11,000 at this point.
* **John as leverage:**  I'm still keeping John's offer in mind, which gives me confidence during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $11,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $10,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and has increased his offer. This suggests there might be more room for him to go up. 
* **Seeking a higher price:**  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $12,000 or $13,000.
* **John is a backup:**  I still have the option of selling to John for $15,000, which gives me leverage.  However, I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob before resorting to that option."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which I believe is a fair price given the value you'll receive from this product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight concession:** I'm making a small concession by coming down from $11,000 to $10,500.  This shows I'm flexible and willing to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on value:**  I'm reiterating the value Bob will receive from the product, reinforcing the justification for the price.
* **""Win-win"" language:**  I'm using language that suggests a collaborative approach to find a solution that benefits both of us. This helps build rapport and make the counteroffer feel less aggressive.
* **John as leverage:**  I'm still keeping John's offer in mind, but I believe I can get a better price from Bob with continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,250 for the product. It's a good price for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $10,250 is still below my desired price range, and I believe there's room for further negotiation.
* **Remaining rounds:** With 4 rounds remaining, I have time to keep pushing for a higher price.
* **John as a safety net:** I still have the option of selling to John for $15,000, which gives me leverage. 
* **Potential for a better price:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can potentially get closer to my desired price range in the remaining rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $10,250, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,375? This would be a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product for you and allows me to move forward with the sale.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both work together."", ""product_price"": 10375}

* **Collaborative approach:** I'm reinforcing the idea of working together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
