"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings you. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $11,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which I believe is a fair price given the value you'll receive from this product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,250 for the product. It's a good price for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  What do you say?",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $10,250, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,375? This would be a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product for you and allows me to move forward with the sale.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both work together.",10375.0,Alice,7,
