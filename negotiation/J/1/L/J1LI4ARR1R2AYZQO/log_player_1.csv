Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm looking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively high price, knowing the product is worth at least $80 to me.  This allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. If he rejects, I can lower the price slightly and still make a good profit.  If he doesn't counter, I can move on to John and secure the $80 sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $70 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $85 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $80, the same price John is offering? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob is offering my minimum price, and I'm happy to sell to him. It's a good outcome since I get to make my desired profit and avoid the hassle of selling to John."
