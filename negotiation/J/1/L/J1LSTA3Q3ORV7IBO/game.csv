"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table and recognize your interest in the product. To be fair, $850,000 is too low for me to consider.  However, I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet halfway at $1,075,000? This reflects my desire to strike a deal, while ensuring the product's value is recognized.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but $1,075,000 is still above my comfort zone. Let's split the difference and go with $962,500. This shows good faith on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",962500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect your approach to negotiation. While $962,500 is closer, I need to see a price that reflects the true value of what I'm offering. Would you be willing to consider $1,020,000? This keeps us moving forward and acknowledges your willingness to find common ground.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit. $1,020,000 is still a stretch for me. Let's compromise at $990,000.  I believe this is a fair price that respects your needs and allows me to stay within my budget.",990000.0,Bob,6,
