"Alice, your offer is quite high for my budget. I'm very interested in your product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $800000 is significantly below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1200000? This would allow us both to find a middle ground and make this deal work.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1200000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $900000. This would allow us to come closer to a deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While I value your offer, $900000 is still not in the range I need to be at.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1050000. This is a fair price that allows us to both walk away feeling good about the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $1050000 is closer, I'm still a bit over budget.  I can go up to $950000.  This represents a significant step for me, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution.  $950000 is closer to my desired price, but it's still not quite there.  I'm willing to go down to $1000000 as my final offer. This is a substantial compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
