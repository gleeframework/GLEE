Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it's worth at least $15,000, but to kick things off, I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob is offering $2,000 less than my initial ask, which is a significant jump. While I want to maximize profit, dragging this out too long could result in him lowering his offer further.  I'm going to try to meet him in the middle.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,000 is closer to my budget, I still can't quite reach that price point. I would like to propose a price of $12,500 for the product.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
