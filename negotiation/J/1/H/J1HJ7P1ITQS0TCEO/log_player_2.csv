Round 2

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is now at my maximum price of $120. This is a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk her changing her mind or going back up in price if I reject her offer.  It's also better to avoid going to John, as I can get the product for the same price here."
