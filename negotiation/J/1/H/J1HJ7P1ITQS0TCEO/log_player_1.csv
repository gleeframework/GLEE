"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $120. I'll counter with a price that's a bit lower than my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's split the difference and see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $115 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'll counter with a price that's closer to my goal of $120."
