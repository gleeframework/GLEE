"I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand your offer, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's my limit. Can you meet me at that price?",9800.0,Bob,4,
