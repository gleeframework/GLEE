"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what I'd normally sell it for. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($120), giving him room to negotiate.
* **Motivating Factor:** I'm highlighting that this is a lower price than I'd typically offer, encouraging Bob to see the value.
* **Openness:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion, signaling that I'm open to discussion. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a good price and keeping the negotiation open for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $100? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it's important to remember that we have 10 rounds.  There is still opportunity to negotiate a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John is a Backup:**  Selling to John for $150 is always an option, but I want to maximize my profit. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired range. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer, likely starting with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer, to find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $140 to $125.
* **Fairness:** $125 is a compromise that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating a desire to reach a fair agreement.
* **Enthusiasm:**  I'm keeping the conversation positive and encouraging further negotiation with the phrase ""Let's find a middle ground!""

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:
*  Get Bob closer to my minimum acceptable price ($150).
*  Demonstrate flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
*  Keep the negotiation moving towards a successful deal."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

* **More Negotiation Room:**  We have 6 rounds left, so there is still time to potentially reach a more favorable price. 
* **Selling to John Remains a Backup:**  Selling to John for $150 is always a safe option, but I'm optimistic about reaching a better price with Bob.

I'll make a counteroffer, likely starting slightly below my previous offer but still above Bob's latest offer, aiming to bridge the gap further."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and demonstrating a willingness to compromise by meeting him halfway between my previous offer ($125) and his offer ($112.50).
* **Fair Profit:**  I'm emphasizing that $118.50 still allows me to make a fair profit, reminding Bob that I'm not simply trying to get the highest possible price.
