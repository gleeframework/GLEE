"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what I'd normally sell it for. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $100? I think that's a fair price.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference and settle on $112.50?",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $118.50. This is closer to your offer, but still allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?",118.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really close. How about we make it a clean $115 and call it a deal?",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting very close!  I'm willing to go down to $117.  This is a very fair price, and it gets us both a great deal. Let's close this out!",117.0,Alice,7,
