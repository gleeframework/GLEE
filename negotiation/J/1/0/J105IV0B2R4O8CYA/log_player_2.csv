"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** You're willing to pay up to $120, but $115 is still a bit more than you'd like to pay.
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's room for negotiation as Alice values the product at $100. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Having John's offer as a backup gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** This is a fair starting point, offering a significant discount from Alice's initial price but still above her valuation.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows us to see how flexible Alice is and how quickly she's willing to compromise.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate further if needed, but it's a reasonable starting point."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:** While better than her first offer, it's still above your ideal price point.

* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing John's offer gives you leverage to push for a better deal."
