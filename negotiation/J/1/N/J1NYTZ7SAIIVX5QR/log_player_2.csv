"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $80. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice.  You have a better option (John) available, so there's less pressure to accept an unfavorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice my maximum price.  This gives her a chance to accept and still make a profit, while staying within my budget.  If she rejects, I can always go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is still above my budget. Since John is willing to sell me the product for $80, it's more beneficial to purchase from him and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
