"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate and still make a profit.  I want to see how much Bob values this product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to come down a bit, but not too much. I still believe the product is worth more than $15,000, and I want to see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise.  It's significantly higher than my minimum of $15,000 and we're in the middle of the negotiation range.  It's not worth risking further rounds with the chance of Bob backing out or me being forced to sell to John for the minimum."
