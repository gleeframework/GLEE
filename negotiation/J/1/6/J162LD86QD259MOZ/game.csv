"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested, I believe $1,150,000 is a bit high. Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while giving you a good return on your investment.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's make it $1,100,000 and close the deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
