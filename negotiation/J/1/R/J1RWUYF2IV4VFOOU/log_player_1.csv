"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is an aggressive opening that aims to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.  It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers.  While I'm confident the product is worth at least $8,000 to me, I want to see if I can get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for a bit higher.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more. I'm aiming for a middle ground that might be appealing to Bob while still getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. Given that I only have 10 rounds to close the deal, accepting his offer is the most logical decision. I can always sell to John for $8,000 if I don't get a better offer, but  $8,500 is a good price that ensures a quick sale."
