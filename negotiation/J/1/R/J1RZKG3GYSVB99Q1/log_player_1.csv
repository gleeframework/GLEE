"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential benefits it offers your company.  Let's start our negotiations with this offer, and we can discuss further details."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I had in mind. This product would be valuable to my company, but $1,750,000 is simply out of our budget. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering it's significantly above my alternative options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value of $1,000,000, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $1,500,000.  I need to see if we can bridge the gap further. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, reflecting the significant value this product brings to your company. This is a fair compromise and a good starting point for us to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a price that reflects the product's value. While I agree it's a good product,  $1,400,000 is still too high for my budget.  I can do $1,200,000. I'm motivated to find an agreement and believe this offer shows I'm serious about purchasing the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price point, but it's still below $1,500,000. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get him to raise his offer a bit more.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John as I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,300,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value this product will bring to your company. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However,  $1,300,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  I can offer  $1,230,000 to demonstrate my willingness to find a middle ground. This is a strong offer, and I hope we can close the deal soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,230,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,230,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum price.  I'm going to continue negotiating with him, as I believe I can still get a better price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,230,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,280,000.  This is a very fair price, considering the value this product brings to your company. Let's make a deal and finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1280000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're invested in finding a fair price, and I respect that. My final offer is $1,250,000. This is a significant investment for my company, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting close to a deal, but Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $1,500,000.  I've only got 2 rounds left, and I don't want to risk getting a lower price.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so I'm going to go with the safe option and sell to him."
