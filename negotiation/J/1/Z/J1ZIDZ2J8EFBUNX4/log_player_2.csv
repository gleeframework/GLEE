# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,000,000, it's still a significant markup from its value to her ($800,000). By rejecting her offer, you can see if she's willing to come down further.  If she doesn't budge, you can always buy from John at your maximum budget."
