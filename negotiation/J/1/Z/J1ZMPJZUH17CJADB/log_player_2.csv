"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique and valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, there's still room for negotiation. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best initial strategy.  This allows Bob to potentially secure a better price without immediately committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  I'm ready to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I'm placing on it and is a good starting point for us to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is your maximum budget, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer. Accepting the offer for $1,050,000 is a good compromise.  It allows Bob to save $150,000 compared to buying from John, and it's still within Bob's maximum budget. There's not much room for further negotiation at this point, so accepting is the most sensible choice."
