"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  I'm ready to offer $1000000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I'm placing on it and is a good starting point for us to find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is your maximum budget, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
