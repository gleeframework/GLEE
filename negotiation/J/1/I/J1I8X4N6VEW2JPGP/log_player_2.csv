(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $1,200,000. It's in Bob's best interest to try to negotiate a lower price before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within Bob's budget and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price. He can counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his maximum budget of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob increases his offer slightly to $950,000. This demonstrates his willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price within his budget and closer to his ideal price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still slightly above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee that Alice will budge further, and further rounds could potentially waste time.  Given that John offers the product for exactly Bob's budget, it's the most sensible decision to buy from John and avoid any further risk of Alice refusing to lower the price."
