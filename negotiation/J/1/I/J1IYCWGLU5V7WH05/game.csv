"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm really interested in this product, though. How about $105? ",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's a great deal for both of us!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. Would you consider $108? That would be a fair price for both of us.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $108 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's compromise at $110, and we can finalize this deal.  It's a great price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",110.0,Alice,5,
