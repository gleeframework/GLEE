Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to part with it for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you have room to negotiate. Starting at $200 allows you to potentially gain an extra $50.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer, and this starting point gives you space to negotiate down without going below your minimum. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  The message is framed to gauge Bob's interest level. If he's immediately put off by the price, you know he might not be willing to pay much more than John."
