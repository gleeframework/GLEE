Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really love it.  I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $70 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point, especially since I have multiple rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $70 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $75? That's a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?"", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $75. Would you be willing to meet me at $72? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $72
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $72 is closer to my goal, I still believe I can get a better price with more negotiation.  I'm not willing to sell to John yet because I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a great price, and I appreciate your persistence! How about we split the difference and go with $73?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 73}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $70 again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $80. While I'm disappointed I didn't get a higher price from Bob, I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a better deal with him. There are only a few rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  John offers a guaranteed price that meets my minimum, so it's the most sensible choice at this point."
