"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it gives me room to negotiate.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for the lowest possible price just yet. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to be flexible, but also that I believe the product is worth more than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price, especially since John is willing to pay $15,000.  I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $16,000. This is a compromise that's closer to my minimum price and shows I'm still willing to negotiate.  Hopefully, this will get Bob closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is way too low. I'm not willing to drop that far below my minimum price, and it's clear that we're not going to come to an agreement.  Instead of continuing to negotiate, I'll sell the product to John for $15,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's still a decent amount of money and I'm not willing to risk getting a lower offer from Bob."
