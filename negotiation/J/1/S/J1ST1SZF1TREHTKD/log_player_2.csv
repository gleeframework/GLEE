"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer. I think the product is a good fit for me, but I'm not willing to pay the full $18,000. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.

{""message"": ""I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $10,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a very fair offer considering the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","Alice's new offer is still too high for me. I'll make another counteroffer, trying to get closer to the price I'm willing to pay.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to get closer to the price I'm willing to pay. I'll offer $12,500, which is still a bit higher than what I'd like to pay, but closer to what I'm willing to accept.

{""message"": ""I'm still interested in the product, but $16,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
