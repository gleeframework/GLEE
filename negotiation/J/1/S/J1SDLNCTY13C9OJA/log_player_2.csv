"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that I believe will greatly benefit you. Considering its value, I propose a price of $140 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $140 is a decent price, it's still higher than Bob's desired maximum of $150.  He should attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering our previous discussion, I would like to counter your offer with a price of $135 for the product. I believe this strikes a good balance between value and affordability for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $135 is below Bob's maximum of $150.
* **It's a good compromise:** While Bob wanted $130,  $135 is a reasonable compromise and saves him $5 compared to buying from John.
* **Time is a factor:** There are only 7 rounds remaining, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal or having to buy from John at a higher price."
