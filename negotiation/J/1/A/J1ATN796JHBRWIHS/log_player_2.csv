Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go lower than $90. This product is worth a lot to me, and I believe it will be highly valuable to you as well.

**Reasoning:**

* While $90 is closer to your maximum value, it's still above your ideal price.

* Rejecting allows you to try and push for a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
