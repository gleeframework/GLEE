"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and what his initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his offer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about negotiating but also that I'm not willing to settle for too low a price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to my original asking price, Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate and this price is significantly better than selling to John. It's time to close the deal."
