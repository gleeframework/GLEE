Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth."", ""product_price"": 95}
```
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize your potential earnings. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($100) leaves space for potential counter-offers while still securing a good deal for you.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $80 gives you leverage in the negotiation. You're not desperate, which strengthens your position. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a high price from Bob and ensuring a sale, even if he declines."
