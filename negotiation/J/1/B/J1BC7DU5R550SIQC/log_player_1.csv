Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 
 
Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $100, you want to see if Bob will pay more than that.  
* **Staying Above Your Minimum:** The $90 offer ensures you make a profit even if Bob accepts.
* **Reasonable Chance of Acceptance:** While $90 is more than Bob's perceived value, it's close enough that he might be willing to pay a premium if he values the convenience or other intangible factors.
