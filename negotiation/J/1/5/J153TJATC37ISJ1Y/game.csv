"I understand that $9000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice. However, $10500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9800?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9800. I can offer it to you for $10000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
