"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal for Alice, it's still above your maximum price. You can get the product for $800,000 from John, which is a much better deal for you."
