"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always a good idea to try and negotiate a better price, especially when you have a backup option like buying from John.  Since Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum, it's worth seeing if you can get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This will hopefully encourage Alice to negotiate further, but still leaves room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a better offer than Alice's initial $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise while still pushing for a better price. This should encourage further negotiation without completely closing the door on a deal."
