Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $100, so I need to offer a price that's appealing but still profitable for me.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** I have a safety net with John, ensuring I won't go below $150. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, but still ensures a significant profit if he accepts outright."
