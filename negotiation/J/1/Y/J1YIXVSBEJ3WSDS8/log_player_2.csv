Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to split the difference, but I'm still not willing to go below $135. I think this product is worth every penny, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $132. It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.

While $132 is closer to my budget, it's still above my preferred price point, and I'm not sure if I can get Alice to lower the price further.  It's better to go with John's offer and save some money."
