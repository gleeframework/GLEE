"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $110?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. It's a great compromise that I think you'll find hard to resist!",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $130 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  That's a good price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to split the difference, but I'm still not willing to go below $135. I think this product is worth every penny, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $132. It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable.",132.0,Alice,5,
