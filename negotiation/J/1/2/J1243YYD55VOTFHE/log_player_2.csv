# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $700,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say?
