"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly motivated to sell, as she values the product at $1,200,000 and is offering it for $900,000.  This suggests there is room for negotiation. By rejecting her offer, I can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to get this product for a bit less. I'm happy to pay $750,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned, and it allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating my eagerness to save money. However, it's not so low that it's likely to be immediately rejected.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** Highlighting the ""mutually beneficial agreement"" emphasizes that I'm not trying to exploit Alice, but find a price that works for both of us.
* **Leveraging her value:** Mentioning her stated value of $1,200,000 reminds her that this offer is still a good deal for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the value I've mentioned, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is coming down:** Alice has moved from $900,000 to $850,000, showing flexibility.
* **Good compromise:** While still above my initial counteroffer, $850,000 is a reasonable compromise. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  It's unlikely Alice will drop significantly further, and buying from John is still significantly more expensive. 

I'm willing to accept this offer to secure the product and avoid the risk of further negotiation or having to purchase from John at a much higher price."
