{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has shown willingness to negotiate, we're still $225,000 apart.  Given that I only have three rounds left and I'm not sure if Alice will budge any further, it's more cost-effective to buy the product from John for my maximum budget of $1,500,000. This ensures I get the product without risking further negotiations that may not be successful."
