Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** Highlighting the value the product has for him encourages him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer gives Bob space to counter without feeling like he's being immediately rejected. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll be prepared to negotiate based on Bob's response, potentially lowering the price slightly, but always keeping my minimum value in mind. If the negotiations stall or I feel like I'm not getting a fair price, I'll move on to John and sell the product for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to get a better price to make it worth my while. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room to negotiate a better price, considering the product's value to him. 
* **Potential for a Higher Price:**  By rejecting his offer, I can potentially get closer to my desired price of $12,000.
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Selling to John for $8,000 would be a significant loss compared to what I can potentially get from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than his offer. I'll aim for a price that's mutually beneficial and encourages a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows I'm serious about making a deal while still protecting my interests.
* **Maintaining Value:** $10,500 is still significantly above my minimum, ensuring I don't settle for a price that undervalues the product.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel like we're working together towards a mutually beneficial outcome.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll be ready to negotiate further or accept his offer if it's close enough to my target.  If negotiations stall or I feel like I'm not getting a fair price, I'll move on to John and sell the product for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is very close to my desired price of $10,500. Accepting his offer would mean a small compromise but still result in a profitable sale.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  Rejecting his offer and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether.  Bob might become unwilling to negotiate further or might decide to seek out another seller. 
* **Avoiding Loss to John:** Selling to John for $8,000 would be a significant loss compared to Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. This is a good outcome, considering the potential risks involved in continued negotiation."
