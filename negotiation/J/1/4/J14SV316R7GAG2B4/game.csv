"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your offer, the product's intrinsic worth and potential benefits warrant a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
