"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit while leaving room for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.  While I'm not in a rush, I'm not willing to settle for that low of an amount just yet. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the first round, but still aiming for a good profit. This counteroffer should be more appealing to Bob, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'm not desperate and I can always sell to John for $1,000,000. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's last offer, but still trying to get a slightly better price. I'm hoping he'll see that I'm serious about getting a deal done, but I'm also not going to give up too much more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not entirely happy with Bob's offer, but I'm starting to feel the pressure. I'm  close to selling to John, but I think I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm making one final push to see if I can get closer to my desired price. This offer is closer to Bob's last offer, but I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price.  If he rejects this, I'll likely just sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I'm not sure I can get much more from Bob.  I'm only a couple of rounds away from my last chance to sell, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price I'm not happy with.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000 to ensure I get a decent profit."
