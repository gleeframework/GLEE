"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,500 for the product.  What do you think?",14500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 might be a bit out of your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,500. I can offer you a compromise at $16,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $15,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go up to $15,500. I can do $16,250, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",16250.0,Alice,5,
