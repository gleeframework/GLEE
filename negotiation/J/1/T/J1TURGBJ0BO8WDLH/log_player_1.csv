{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair offer considering its worth to both of us. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Starting with an offer closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) maximizes potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $925,000 leaves some space for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** While a higher offer like $950,000 might net more, it increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright.  $925,000 balances a strong profit margin with a higher likelihood of acceptance.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The safety net of John's offer at $800,000 ensures Alice doesn't need to desperately lowball the price."
