{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $9,000 is still too high for Bob, given the product is worth $12,000 to him.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a good deal.  Offering $7,500 is a strong starting point, and it is still below the product's worth to Alice ($8,000).  This leaves room for negotiation if Alice rejects the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is slightly higher than her previous offer, it is still too high for Bob. He is aiming to save as much money as possible, and $9,500 is still significantly above the product's value to him.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise. $8,000 is still below the product's value to Alice, but it's a significant step closer to her perceived value. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's seriousness about closing the deal while remaining within his budget."
