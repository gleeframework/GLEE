"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  It's worth at least $1200000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you.  I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1250000.  This allows for a fair profit for me while also giving you a chance to acquire something you value highly.  Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
