# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price closer to $900,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $800,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we try $850,000? This is still a good deal for you, and it's a reasonable compromise for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000.  You have a guaranteed offer from John at $800,000, your maximum price. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice and risking her raising her price or reaching an impasse.  It's time to secure the product at the best known price."
