"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand this product is valuable, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I'd be more comfortable with a price closer to $700,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price closer to $900,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  That way we both feel like we're getting a fair deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $800,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we try $850,000? This is still a good deal for you, and it's a reasonable compromise for me.",850000.0,Alice,5,
