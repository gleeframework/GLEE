{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's valuation of $80 but below your minimum of $150. It leaves room for negotiation, hopefully leading to a deal that is beneficial for both of us.  I'm willing to negotiate a bit, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum price. I'm going to send him a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $120, so how about $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is still too low for me.  I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $150.  John is a guaranteed sale at that price, so I'll go with him."
