"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to me is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $700,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $775,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

This is a good price for the product, well below your maximum and a good deal below Alice's stated value. Holding out for a lower price might not be worth the risk of losing the deal."
