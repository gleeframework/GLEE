Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Minimum Value:** I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, so I won't accept anything lower. 
* **Potential Upside:**  I want to maximize my profit, so I'm offering a price higher than my minimum. $1,500,000 is a significant amount, but it's not unreasonable if Bob values the product highly. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 gives me a safety net. If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed that amount. 

By offering $1,500,000, I'm balancing my desire to earn more with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
