I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I don't want to risk further negotiations. I'm happy to secure the sale for $1,200,000."
