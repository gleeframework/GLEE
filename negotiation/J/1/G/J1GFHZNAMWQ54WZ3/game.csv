"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value, but I believe I can't justify spending $20,000 on it at this time. Would you consider lowering the price to something closer to my budget, perhaps around $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still looking to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate down to $15,000? This feels like a fair compromise given my financial constraints.",15000.0,Bob,4,
