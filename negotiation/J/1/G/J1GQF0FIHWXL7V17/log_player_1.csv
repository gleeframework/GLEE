"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $145. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and increases the chances of a deal in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $130 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $150. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $130 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm aiming for a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows flexibility and keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $137. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $137. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $137
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While $137 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $137 is still a little low for me. Let's try to split the difference -  I'm willing to come down to $139.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 139}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer, hoping to close the deal at a price slightly above my minimum.  I've stated that it's my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $139 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $136, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $136. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $136
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $136 is too low for me, and we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. At this point, it's more advantageous for me to sell to John for $150, which is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $150, I don't want to risk losing out on that guaranteed amount by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
