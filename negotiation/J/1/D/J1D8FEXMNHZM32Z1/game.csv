"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $10,000 to me.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. Unfortunately, $12,000 is outside my budget. I'm interested in the product but I can only go as high as $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its worth $10,000 to me, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you meet me halfway at $7,500? ",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us. I'm getting close to my minimum price, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,500 is close, but to be honest, my absolute limit is $8,000.  If you can do that, we have a deal.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your limit, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more adjustment. I can offer it to you for $8,200. This is the last concession I can make, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",8200.0,Alice,7,
