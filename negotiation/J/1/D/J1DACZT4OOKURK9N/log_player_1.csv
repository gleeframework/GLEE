{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer aims to maximize my profit while still being attractive to Bob.  It's a starting point, and I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary, but I also have the option of selling to John for $12,000 if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to find a compromise closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is tempting, it's below my minimum price.  Let's split the difference - how about $11,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'd be happy with the product. "", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $11,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's likely that further negotiation won't result in a significantly higher offer.  I'm going to accept his offer to avoid risking the deal falling through and having to sell to John for a lower price."
