Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited about the prospect of you acquiring this product. I've evaluated its value to me at no less than $1,500,000. However, considering your interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still maintaining a healthy profit margin.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and enthusiastic, highlighting the value I see in the product. This creates a positive atmosphere for negotiation.  

**Why this is a good strategy:**

* **Attractive Offer:**  $1,400,000 is a strong starting point, offering Bob a potential deal.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This price leaves room for me to lower it slightly if needed, without dropping below my minimum.
* **Positive Tone:** My message establishes a collaborative tone, making Bob more likely to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even below my initial offer.  Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me.  

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer. My goal is to find a price that is closer to my minimum while still being attractive to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,050,000 is significantly below my minimum, I'm open to further negotiation.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit while ensuring you get a great deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm proposing a price that is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's perspective, showing a willingness to compromise, and emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Middle Ground:** This price is a reasonable compromise, allowing for potential further negotiation if needed.

**Why this is a good strategy:**

* **Shows Flexibility:** Demonstrating a willingness to compromise can encourage Bob to come closer to my price.
* **Maintains Profit Margin:**  $1,250,000 is still above my minimum, ensuring a reasonable profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a respectful and cooperative tone, which can lead to a more successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something below $1,150,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit more? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Further negotiation with Bob would likely involve too much compromise and potentially result in a sale far below my desired price.

Therefore, it's in my best interest to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This ensures I receive my minimum price and secure a profitable transaction."
