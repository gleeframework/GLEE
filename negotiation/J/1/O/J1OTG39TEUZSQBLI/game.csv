"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,050,000 is significantly below my minimum, I'm open to further negotiation.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit while ensuring you get a great deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
