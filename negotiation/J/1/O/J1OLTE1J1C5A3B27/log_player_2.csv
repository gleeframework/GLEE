Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $76.50. This is my last offer, so I hope you can meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $76.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $76.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $76.50.  While you could try to negotiate further, you risk her sticking to her ""final offer"" and you losing the opportunity to buy from John for $80.  It's safer to switch to John and secure the $80 price."
