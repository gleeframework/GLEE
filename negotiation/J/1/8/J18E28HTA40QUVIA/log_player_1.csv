Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8000.  Would you consider $8500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let's make this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $8750? It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

$8,750 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm not desperate to sell, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $8,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, and offer $8,875. This is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8875}
