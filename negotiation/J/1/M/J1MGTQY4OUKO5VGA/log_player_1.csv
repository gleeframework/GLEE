"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above my minimum:**  I want to maximize my profit, so I'm starting higher than my minimum value of $1,200,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** I can still come down if Bob counteroffers.

I'll need to carefully observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy in the following rounds based on his reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, it's still a significant amount, and I believe there's room for a higher price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to increase his bid."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum. It shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate. I'm hoping that Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is inching closer to my minimum, but I'm not satisfied with his current offer. It's a bit too low for my liking, and I'm still hoping to squeeze out a bit more. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to go higher. I'm also starting to consider the possibility of selling to John if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000.  This is a bit closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping that we can come to a compromise in the next few rounds. I'm also keeping a close eye on the possibility of selling to John if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum.  I'm running out of rounds, and it's not clear if I can get a better price.  I'm going to accept his offer and secure the sale. It's better to take a slightly lower price than risk losing the deal entirely."
