"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $8,000.  Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving some room for compromise without immediately being too aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,200 is a better offer than $9,500, Bob still has room to negotiate a lower price.  He's already shown a willingness to go lower than $9,000, and Alice has shown some flexibility. Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a price closer to Bob's desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $9,000, demonstrating his willingness to compromise. This is a good middle ground between his previous offer of $8,500 and Alice's latest offer of $9,200.  It's likely Alice will be willing to accept this offer as it's closer to her desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $9,150, which is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $9,000.  It's unlikely Alice will budge further, and Bob can save $850 compared to buying from John.  It's a good deal for Bob, so he should accept the offer."
