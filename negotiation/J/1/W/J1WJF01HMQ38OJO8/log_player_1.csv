I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. It's also important to keep in mind that John is willing to pay $1,500,000, so I have a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,800,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get closer to my goal.  I'll counter with a lower price than $2,000,000 but still higher than $1,800,000 to see if we can meet in the middle."

I'm offering $1,900,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and hopefully, we can come to a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000

While I'd like to secure a sale, $1,700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him higher with a counteroffer."

I'm offering $1,850,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but still significantly higher than his initial offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

I'm going to sell to John.  While I'd like to get closer to $1,850,000, the negotiations are getting tedious and there's no guarantee that Bob will come up to my price. Selling to John gives me a guaranteed profit of $350,000, and it's time to move on."
