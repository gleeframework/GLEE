"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially pricing it at $14,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's important to start the negotiation by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be a valuable asset to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial $14,000, it's still above your budget.  Continuing the negotiation with a counteroffer is the best strategy to see if you can get a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm comfortable paying $9,500.  This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs."", ""product_price"": 9500}
