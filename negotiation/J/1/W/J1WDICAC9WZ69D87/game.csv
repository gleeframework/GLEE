"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be a valuable asset to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm comfortable paying $9,500.  This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs.",9500.0,Bob,4,
