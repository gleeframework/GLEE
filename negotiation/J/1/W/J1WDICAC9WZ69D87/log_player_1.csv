"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially pricing it at $14,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be a valuable asset to you."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm comfortable paying $9,500.  This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer of $10,000 within the remaining rounds.  Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of him not meeting the $10,000 threshold. Taking the guaranteed $10,000 from John is the most logical choice at this point."
