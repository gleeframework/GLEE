Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, Alice subtly hints at its worth without directly revealing her minimum price.
* **Alternative Option:**  Subtly implying she has other options (listing it publicly) creates a sense of urgency and scarcity. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains conversational with ""What do you think?"",  showing Alice is open to discussing the price further."
