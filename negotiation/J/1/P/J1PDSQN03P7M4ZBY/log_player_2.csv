"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price that reflects its true worth, and I believe it will be a great investment for you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You know the product is worth $1,200,000 to you, and Alice is also valuing it at the same amount. This means there's no room for negotiation to save money. 

Since you have the option to buy from John for the same price, rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice. You're not losing any money, and you might have a better chance of negotiating a lower price with John in the future."
