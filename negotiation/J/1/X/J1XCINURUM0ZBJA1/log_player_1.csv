"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175, which is a bit above Bob's perceived value of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate but also shows I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $140 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $150. I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $160. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's value. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't give in too easily."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. There are still several rounds left, and I'm willing to see if I can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm counteroffering at $155. This is my final offer, as it's only $5 above my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects, I'll sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has now offered my minimum, but I'm running out of rounds.  It's not worth risking a further negotiation, as there's no guarantee he'll go higher, and I have a guaranteed sale with John.  It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John."
