Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, leveraging the information we have:

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,500. This is a limited-time offer; let me know your decision soon."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $12,000, starting higher than our minimum ($12,000) gives us negotiation room. 
* **Sense of urgency:**  By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" we encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid losing the deal.
* **Justification for the price:** While not explicitly stating the product's value, implying it's ""worth it"" might make Bob more receptive to the higher price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's negotiating style:**  We don't know anything about Bob's personality.  If he's very price-sensitive, this offer might backfire. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a chance Bob will reject the offer, forcing us to sell to John at $12,000. We're balancing the risk of losing the deal against the potential for higher profit.

**This is just one strategy. You could adjust the offer based on your risk tolerance and any additional information you gather about Bob.**"
