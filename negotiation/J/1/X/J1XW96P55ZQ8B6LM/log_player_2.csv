"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued potential customer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is above Bob's target price of $12,000.
* It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you coming down to $14,000.  However, I'm looking to spend closer to $13,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product can bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above Bob's target price of $12,000, but it's closer than John's price of $15,000.
* Accepting this offer saves Bob $1,500 compared to buying from John.
* There's a chance Bob could negotiate further, but the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential savings."
