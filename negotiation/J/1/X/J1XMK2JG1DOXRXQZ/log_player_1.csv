"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

This offer is aggressive, aiming for a significant portion of the potential profit. It's also high enough that Bob might be willing to negotiate down. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm setting the bar high to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $1,150,000 is a significant amount, but it still leaves room for Bob to counter-offer and for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing that I have John as a backup buyer for $1,000,000 allows me to be more aggressive in my negotiations with Bob.

Let's see how Bob responds!"

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still higher than John's offer.** While it's a significant drop from my initial offer, it's still a better deal than selling to John.
* **There's room for further negotiation.**  I can likely push Bob up a bit more, and there are still 8 rounds left to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 

I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $1,150,000 to $1,125,000. 
* **Maintain profit:** This price still leaves me with a significant profit, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Keep the pressure on:** By offering a slightly lower price, I'm hoping Bob will realize that he needs to meet me closer to the middle ground if he wants to secure the product. 

Let's see if this counteroffer is acceptable to Bob."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still higher than John's offer.** While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still worth exploring if I can get a better deal.

* **More rounds left:**  The remaining rounds give me the opportunity to potentially get a higher price than Bob's current offer.

I'll try to counter with a slightly higher price, but I'm prepared to accept a slightly lower price if it means closing the deal."

* **Still above John's offer:** This price remains higher than John's offer, ensuring I don't lose out on potential profit.
* **Increasing pressure:** By sticking with a relatively high price, I'm aiming to nudge Bob towards accepting my offer.
