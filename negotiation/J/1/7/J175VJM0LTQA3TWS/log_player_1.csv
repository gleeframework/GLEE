Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation while still being above Bob's perceived value.  It also gives me a good starting point to gauge his interest and potential for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I will counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show willingness to compromise, but still keeping it above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price. This demonstrates flexibility while still securing a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum price expectation. While selling to John means a lower profit than I initially hoped for, it guarantees a sale above my minimum value and avoids further negotiation with Bob. It's time to move on."
