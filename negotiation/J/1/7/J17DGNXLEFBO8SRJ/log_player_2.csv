```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still very confident in the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. What do you think?

```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500? It's a fair price that allows us both to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10500 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10800.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,800 is within your budget, it's still above your goal of saving as much money as possible.  You have a few rounds left, and it's worth seeing if you can push Alice down to $10,000 or closer.  Rejecting her offer gives you that opportunity."

# Alice's message: I understand that $10200 is a serious offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a final offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you've been very accommodating, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  If you're serious about making a deal, I'm willing to go up to $10,300. This is my final offer.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10300}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to get a little frustrated with the back-and-forth. I'm willing to make one more concession, but this is my final offer. I'll sell the product to you for $10400. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to consider other options. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round of negotiations with Alice.  You have two options:

* **Accept Alice's offer:** This would cost you $10,400, saving you $600 compared to buying from John. 
* **Reject Alice's offer:**  This risks the deal falling apart.  Since it's the final round, there's no guarantee Alice will counter-offer again. You would then have to buy from John at $10,000.

**The best course of action:**

Given the risk of losing the deal and the relatively small savings, it's better to play it safe and buy from John for $10,000. This guarantees you get the product and minimizes your risk."
