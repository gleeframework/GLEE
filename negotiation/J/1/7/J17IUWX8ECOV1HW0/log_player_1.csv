# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I believe $1000000 is a bit steep. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $750000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this item. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.
