"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for $1000000. It's a unique and highly sought-after item, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since Alice's initial offer is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, there's no incentive to accept it immediately. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I believe $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $750,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this item. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your interest. While $750000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $850000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of this product, and it would allow me to move forward with this transaction.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved from her initial price of $1,000,000 to $850,000. This is a significant concession, and it's a good deal for Bob, considering he's willing to pay up to $1,000,000.  While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice rejecting a lower counteroffer and Bob having to buy from John at the full price outweighs the potential savings."
