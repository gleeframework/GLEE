"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. $130 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $80?",80.0,Bob,4,
