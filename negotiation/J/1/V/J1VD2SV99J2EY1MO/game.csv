"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $10000 to make this worthwhile for me.  How about we settle on $10500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10250. This is the highest I can go, but I'm really interested in making a deal.",10250.0,Bob,4,
