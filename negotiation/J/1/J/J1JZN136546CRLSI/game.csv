"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested!",170.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it, but $170 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be open to $140? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155. This is a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know if you're interested!",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your offer, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $145. This is the absolute maximum I can pay. What do you say?",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $145 is a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll meet you at $152. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to someone else.",152.0,Alice,5,
