Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time. This represents the maximum value I'm willing to pay. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
