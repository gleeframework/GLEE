{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer. $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $700,000 is a substantial discount from her initial price, but still leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to meet me halfway. While $850,000 is better than her initial price, it's still more than I'm willing to pay at this point. I'll continue to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down in price, but I'm still hoping for a lower deal. I'm going to keep pushing for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm going to raise my offer again, getting closer to Alice's price. However,  I'm still holding out for a slightly better deal. This shows good faith and a willingness to compromise, but also avoids giving in too quickly."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my target price, but I'm still going to try for a better deal.  I'm confident I can negotiate a price closer to $800,000.  I'll keep pressing, but I'm also keeping an eye on how many rounds we have left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 810000}
```

This is my final push.  I'm increasing my offer to $810,000, demonstrating my willingness to close the deal.  It's a reasonable compromise, and we are running out of rounds.  Hopefully, Alice will accept."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

With only one round left, it's time to accept Alice's offer.  $815,000 is a good price and allows me to save a significant amount compared to buying from John.  It's important to balance getting a good deal with the potential for a stalled negotiation.  I'm happy with the price and the product, so I'm closing the deal."
