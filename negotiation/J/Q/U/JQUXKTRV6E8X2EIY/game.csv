"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be happy to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $12,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $11,000, which would split the difference between our last offers. Let me know if that's something you're able to do.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite willing to go as low as $11,000, but I'm still willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $13,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,5,
