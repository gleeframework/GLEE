Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it provides significant value, and I'm asking for $20,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation and gives the impression the product's value might be even higher. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give me valuable information about his level of interest and potential for negotiation. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John. This allows me to be bolder in my negotiation with Bob."
