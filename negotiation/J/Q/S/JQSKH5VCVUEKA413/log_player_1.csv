Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While Bob only values the product at $80, it's best to start with a price closer to your minimum ($150). This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** By mentioning a ""special price"" and highlighting ""value,""  you aim to make the offer more appealing without directly referencing Bob's perceived value. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The price of $120 is significantly higher than Bob's valuation, but it leaves you with a comfortable profit margin even if he tries to negotiate down slightly.  You have the security of John's offer ($150) if Bob rejects this initial proposition."
