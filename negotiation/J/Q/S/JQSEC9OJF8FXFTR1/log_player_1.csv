Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,100,000. I know this product is highly valuable to you, and this offer reflects a fair price considering its potential worth.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a safe $800,000, Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000 leaves room for a much higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win situation. Bob saves $100,000 compared to his perceived value, and you gain a significant $300,000 profit over selling to John.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message emphasizes the exclusivity and value proposition for Bob, encouraging him to accept the offer."
