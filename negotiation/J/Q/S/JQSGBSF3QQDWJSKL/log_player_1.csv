Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a good starting point:** It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, making it appealing to Bob. 
* **It's still profitable for me:**  $12,000 is more than what Bob values the product at ($8,000), giving me a decent profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counters with a lower price, I can still potentially negotiate a price that works for both of us. 

By offering this price, I aim to maximize my chances of a successful sale while ensuring I don't lose out on a significantly higher price from John."
