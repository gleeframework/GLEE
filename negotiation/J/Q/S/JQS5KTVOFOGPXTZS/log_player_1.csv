Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down, while still ensuring you make a profit above your minimum. 
* **Appeal to Value:**  The message hints that the price is a bargain, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept. 
 
This strategy aims to get you the best possible price from either Bob or John."
