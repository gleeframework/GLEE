"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I'm eager to find a deal that works for us, $1,100,000 is below its true value.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,225,000 is closer, but I'm still a little off. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $1,162,500?",1162500.0,Bob,4,
