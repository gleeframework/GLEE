"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to discuss the details with you. I'm willing to offer you the product for $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm thinking closer to $11,000 for the product. Would that work for you?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $14,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value it brings to your business.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend. Could you do $12,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit higher than your target price, but I'm not willing to go below $13,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Can you meet me at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $12,500? This is a fair offer considering the other options I have available.",12500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,500 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Can you meet me at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, we're getting close! I can do $12,750, but that's really the best I can offer. Let me know if that works for you.",12750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $12,750, which would be $12,875. Can you consider that?",12875.0,Alice,9,
