"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Attractive but Not Outrageous:** The price is within a realistic range for Bob, considering he values the product at $800,000.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is friendly and leaves the door open for further discussion.

**Important Note:**  This is just the first round. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response in subsequent rounds, keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1200000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for your product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is higher than his perceived value ($800,000), it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Room for Compromise:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price that is acceptable to both of us.
* **Counteroffer:** By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer of $1,000,000, I am signaling my willingness to negotiate while remaining firm on my minimum price.

**Important Note:** This is a strategic move. By refusing Bob's offer, I put pressure on him to consider my counteroffer. If he still rejects it, I can always choose to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,000,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's also the minimum I can accept. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising but Firm:** I'm lowering my price to $1,000,000 which is still a good profit for me and shows my willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the product's value and reiterate my minimum acceptable price.
* **Closing the Deal:** I express my desire to finalize the deal and urge Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer again, I will seriously consider selling to John for $1,000,000. While I prefer to sell to Bob, I won't accept a price that undervalues the product for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $900000 for the product. This is a significant amount, and I believe it's a fair price given the value we both see in the product. Let's try to find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Opportunity for a compromise:** There's still room for negotiation. A counteroffer of $950,000 shows flexibility while staying within my desired range.
* **Maintaining pressure:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the pressure to close the deal and potentially convince him to accept my counteroffer.

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I will strongly consider selling to John for $1,000,000. The risk of losing the potential gain of $50,000 needs to be weighed against the possibility of  further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. $900,000 is a good starting point.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising Further:**  I've lowered my offer again, showing a clear willingness to compromise and find common ground with Bob.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I emphasize the value of the product to reiterate why my price is fair.
* **Urgency and Positivity:** I use phrases like ""make this happen"" to create a sense of urgency and a positive atmosphere for the deal. 

**Important Note:** This is a crucial round. If Bob rejects this offer, I will seriously consider selling to John for $1,000,000.  However, I believe this offer is attractive enough that Bob might accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $925000 for the product, which is a significant amount closer to my limit. I believe this price reflects the value we both see in the product. Let's try to reach a final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""product_price"": 937500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Close:** Bob's offer of $925,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Small Compromise:**  A counteroffer of $937,500 represents a smaller compromise from my previous offer. This signals to Bob that I'm almost at my limit.
* **Last Chance:** This counteroffer will likely be my last chance to negotiate with Bob.  If he rejects it, I will likely sell to John.

**Important Note:**  At this point, the potential profit from selling to Bob is shrinking, and I need to weigh the risk of a further negotiation against the certainty of selling to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're almost there!  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.  $937,500 is my final offer. This price is fair to both of us and allows us to close this deal.  I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you."", ""product_price"": 937500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making this clear to Bob that this is my last offer.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  By meeting Bob's last offer halfway, I'm demonstrating a genuine willingness to close the deal. 
* **Positive Outlook:**  I use language like ""valuable asset"" to reinforce the positive value of the product and encourage Bob to accept. 

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this final offer, I will immediately sell the product to John.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I need to ensure I get a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price."
