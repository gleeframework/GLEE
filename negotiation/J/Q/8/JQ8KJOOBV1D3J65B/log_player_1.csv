I'll reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than selling to John, I can likely get closer to my desired price of $120."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer. $100 is a good price, and it's likely that if I reject it, I might not be able to get a higher price in the remaining rounds."
