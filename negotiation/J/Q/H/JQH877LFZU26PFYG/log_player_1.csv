Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant amount higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but also leaves room for negotiation and ensures that Bob sees value in continuing the discussion.  I'll be watching Bob's response carefully to determine my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $975,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still maintaining a higher price. I believe this shows flexibility while also demonstrating that I'm still confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm hoping for. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $950,000.  I'm meeting Bob halfway this time, as his offer is getting closer to what I'm comfortable with, and it signals my willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still holding firm on getting at least $950,000 for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It seems Bob is not willing to budge on his offer.  While $920,000 is a respectable price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth, and we're reaching a point where the negotiation isn't productive. I'm going to take John's offer and move on."
