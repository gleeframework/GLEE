"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you're willing to work with me.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $9,750. This is a great compromise, considering the value you'll get from it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,750 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm ready to pay $9,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a fair price for you, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $9,500, which is still a good compromise considering the value you'll get from it. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",9500.0,Alice,5,
