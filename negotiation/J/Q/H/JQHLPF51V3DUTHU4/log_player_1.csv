Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product today.  I believe it holds significant value and would be a great asset to you. I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $12,000 and I have a guaranteed sale at that price, I want to start high to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The $18,000 offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, giving me the opportunity to still sell above my minimum price. 
* **Confidence:**  The message projects confidence in the product's value, which might persuade Bob to meet the higher price.

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. Depending on my negotiation style and how much I want to ensure Bob buys the product, I might start with a lower offer closer to $12,000."
