Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm offering it to you for $150.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is higher than my minimum, but still potentially attractive to Bob. It also uses a friendly tone to encourage further negotiation.  

This strategy aims to:

* **Test the waters:** See if Bob is even interested in the product at a price above my minimum.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  The price is not so high that it would immediately deter Bob, allowing for a potential counteroffer. 
* **Set the bar high:**  By starting with a higher price, I might be able to get closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe there is still room to negotiate a higher price. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you're trying to stay within your budget.  I can come down a bit to $140.  This is a good deal for you and still fair for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. I would like to propose a price of $135, if that's possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $135 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. It's worth accepting his offer, as further negotiation might lead to a lower price, or worse, to a complete breakdown in negotiations.  I'm happy to sell the product to Bob for $135."
