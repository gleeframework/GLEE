Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer gives Bob a good deal, allowing him to still make a profit of $50,000. It also leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob wants to try and get a lower price.  However, it's a significant enough price that I'm still earning a substantial profit and not risking selling to John for a lower amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I will reject his offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

This counteroffer is still significantly higher than John's offer, and it also brings the price closer to my desired price. I believe this is a fair compromise that will encourage Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd ideally like a higher price, Bob's offer is very close to my last counteroffer and  is still a significant profit for me.  There's a risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower offer, or me needing to sell to John for less.  It's time to close the deal and secure the profit."
