Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle for a price higher than John's offer. 
* **Justify the Price:** By mentioning the product's value, you provide a reason for your asking price, even if you don't go into specifics.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's financial situation or how badly he wants the product. If you had more information, you might adjust your approach."
