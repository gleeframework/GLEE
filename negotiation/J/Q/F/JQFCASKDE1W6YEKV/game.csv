"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,500,000 is still quite a way off from what I have in mind.  This product has significant potential and I've priced it accordingly.  How about we meet halfway? I'm willing to let it go for $1,650,000.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,550,000 is still below my bottom line. To be frank, I have another interested buyer. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, but that's my final offer. This is a great deal for a product you won't find elsewhere.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
