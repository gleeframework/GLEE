Explanation:

While Bob's offer is still below our initial target, accepting $1,575,000 is a strategic decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing negotiations might yield a slightly higher price, but the risk of losing Bob entirely increases. Each counteroffer reduces the potential profit incrementally.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate capital.  Prolonging the negotiation delays access to these funds, which could be invested elsewhere.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Focusing on a potentially stubborn buyer could lead us to miss other opportunities. Accepting a good offer frees us to explore alternative deals.

While we could push for $1,600,000, Bob has presented this as his ""final"" offer.  Rejecting it entirely risks losing him, leaving us with the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, a significantly less attractive outcome than the current offer on the table."
