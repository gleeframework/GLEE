Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true market value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's a fair compromise between my minimum acceptable price ($8,000) and the value Bob places on the product ($12,000).
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and persuasive tone, emphasizing the value of the product and the good deal I'm offering. This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider my offer. 

**Reasoning:**

By starting with a price closer to the middle ground, I hope to:

* **Avoid immediate rejection:** Bob is more likely to consider a price that is closer to his own valuation.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  There's still some room for me to go lower if needed, while also ensuring I get a price significantly higher than my minimum.
* **Encourage Bob to make a counteroffer:** This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a higher price. 

I'm confident that this offer will be a good starting point for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  Accepting his offer would mean earning $1,500 more than selling to John.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial offer of $10,000,  it's unlikely Bob will budge further. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate risks delaying the sale and potentially losing Bob as a buyer altogether. 
* **Profit maximization:**  $9,500 is a significant profit considering my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Avoiding risk:**  There's no guarantee I can get a higher price in future rounds, and selling to John offers less profit.

It's strategically sound to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale that brings a good profit."
