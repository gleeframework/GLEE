**Reasoning:** Alice is no longer negotiating reasonably. Her latest offer is a significant step backward and closer to her initial asking price. It's clear she's trying to push closer to your maximum budget.  At this point, it's more advantageous to cut your losses and buy from John for $1,000,000."
