"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $110? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",110.0,Alice,5,
