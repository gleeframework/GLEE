{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset for your business.  Given its potential, I'm setting the initial price at $1,400,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth. Let's discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, I'm not quite ready to commit to $1,400,000. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product and gives us both some room to work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum target of $1,000,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold for this product. However, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing $1,300,000. This gives you a good price point and allows me to secure a fair value for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $1,250,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'll continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  However, $1,250,000 simply doesn't cover my minimum requirements.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,280,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.  I'm confident that this is the best offer I can make."", ""product_price"": 1280000}
