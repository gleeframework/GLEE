"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset for your business.  Given its potential, I'm setting the initial price at $1,400,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth. Let's discuss further.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, I'm not quite ready to commit to $1,400,000. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product and gives us both some room to work with.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold for this product. However, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing $1,300,000. This gives you a good price point and allows me to secure a fair value for the product.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $1,250,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  However, $1,250,000 simply doesn't cover my minimum requirements.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,280,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.  I'm confident that this is the best offer I can make.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
