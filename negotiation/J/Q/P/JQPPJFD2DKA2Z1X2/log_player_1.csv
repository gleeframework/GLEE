Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product while directly stating the price.  

**Strategy:**

* **High starting point:** By starting high, I create room for negotiation while still maximizing potential profit.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the conversation open.
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing I have another buyer willing to pay $12,000 gives me a strong negotiating position. I can use John's offer as a reference point if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  

**Strategy:**

* **Reject and counter:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price. 
* **Leverage John's offer:**  I'll use John's offer of $12,000 as a benchmark in my counteroffer to Bob. 

I'll now send Bob a counteroffer that reflects my minimum acceptable price while still leaving room for a potential compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While I can't go as low as $8,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $9,250? This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering $9,250, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500. 
* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's budget concerns while emphasizing a potential win-win scenario.  
* **Strategy:**
    * **Compromise:** My counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price closer to my desired value.
    * **Positive framing:** The message focuses on a ""good deal"" for both of us, fostering a collaborative tone.
    * **Flexibility:**  I'm still leaving room for further negotiation if Bob isn't happy with my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,750 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I believe that continuing to negotiate with Bob would likely result in a price that is too low for me, especially considering I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my desired price.

**Strategy:**

* **Prioritize Profit:**  My goal is to maximize profit, and John's offer ensures I achieve that. 
* **Time is Money:**  Further negotiation with Bob would take time and might not lead to a significantly better outcome.
* **Avoid Risk:**  Selling to John eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially ending in a lower price. 

By selling to John, I secure a guaranteed profit and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
