Round 2

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be honest, my budget is capped at $900,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I might need to explore other options.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Explanation:

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his latest offer of $900,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. It's becoming clear that our valuations are too far apart to reach a mutually beneficial deal.  

At this point, continuing the negotiation with Bob risks losing a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. It makes the most business sense to cut my losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
