"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit above what I know Bob is willing to pay, but still within a reasonable range. I'm also trying to build rapport by highlighting that I'm willing to negotiate. This should hopefully encourage Bob to engage in a back-and-forth rather than immediately rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe I can only offer $14,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm interested in a deal, I want to try to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to the value I place on the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price, but I've lowered my offer to show flexibility and keep the negotiation going. I'm also trying to emphasize the value I'm offering to Bob by mentioning that he'd still get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am able to offer $15,500 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $15,500, which is above my minimum price of $15,000 and is close to my ideal selling price. It's also higher than John's offer of $15,000.  Therefore, I will accept Bob's offer to maximize my profit."
