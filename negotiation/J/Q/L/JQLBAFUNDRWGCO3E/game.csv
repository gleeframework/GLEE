"Bob, I understand your budget constraints and am willing to work with you. However, $1000000 simply doesn't cover the value and potential of this product for your business.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower my price to $1050000.  This is a significant concession, reflecting my desire to find a solution that benefits us both. Let's find common ground and close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
