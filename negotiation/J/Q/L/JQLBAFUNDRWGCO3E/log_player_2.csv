"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm confident it will deliver substantial value to your business. My initial price for the product is $1100000. This reflects its high quality and the potential it holds. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's talk! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before committing."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints and am willing to work with you. However, $1000000 simply doesn't cover the value and potential of this product for your business.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower my price to $1050000.  This is a significant concession, reflecting my desire to find a solution that benefits us both. Let's find common ground and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,050,000 is still above Bob's budget.  Bob can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  He can also choose to buy from John at any time, but it's worth seeing if he can get a slightly better deal from Alice before committing."
