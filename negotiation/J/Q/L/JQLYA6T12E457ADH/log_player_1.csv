"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, just below my minimum acceptable value. This sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for potential compromise.  Since Bob values the product at $8,000, he might be willing to negotiate up to $10,000 or even closer to my price, especially if he wants the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $10,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable value. Hopefully, this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value. Although I'd prefer to get closer to $10,000, accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation. It's important to consider that the longer the negotiation goes on, the more likely it is that either Bob will walk away or I'll have to settle for selling to John."
