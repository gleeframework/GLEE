"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I'll sell it to you for $9,250?  It's still a great deal considering the value of this product.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $9,250 is still above what I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's make this deal happen.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  However,  $8,750 is still below my desired price point. Let's meet in the middle at $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value of this product, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",9000.0,Alice,5,
