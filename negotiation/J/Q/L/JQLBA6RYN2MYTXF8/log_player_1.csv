Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I'll sell it to you for $9,250?  It's still a great deal considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 9250}
