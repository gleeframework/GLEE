You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering.  It makes the most sense to buy from John for $12,000."
