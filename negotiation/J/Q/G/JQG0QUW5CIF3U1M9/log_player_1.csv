Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm Alice, and I have a product that I think would be of great interest to you. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant benefit you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Our Minimum:** We need to make at least $800,000 (our guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to maximize our profit, so offering it for slightly less than $1,000,000 makes sense.
* **Choosing $925,000:** This price leaves a good profit margin for us ($125,000 over our minimum) while still being very attractive to Bob, who saves $75,000 compared to his valuation.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a tempting offer for Bob and a substantial profit for Alice."
