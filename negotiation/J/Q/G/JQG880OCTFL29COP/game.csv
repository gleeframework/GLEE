"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a little low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,
