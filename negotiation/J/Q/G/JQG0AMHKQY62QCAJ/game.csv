"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product,  $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This reflects a significant discount from my maximum, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $1,075,000. This is a good middle ground that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
