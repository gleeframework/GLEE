"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value item. I'm looking for a serious buyer, and I think you might be the right person for it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Since Bob's maximum budget is $15,000, accepting Alice's offer for $15,000 allows him to acquire the product without exceeding his budget. There's no advantage in rejecting the offer and then buying from John at the same price."
