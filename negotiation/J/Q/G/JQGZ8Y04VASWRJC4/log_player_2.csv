Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price.
