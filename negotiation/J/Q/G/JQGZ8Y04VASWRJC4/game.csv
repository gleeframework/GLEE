"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. It's a fair compromise and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. I can see you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $1,080,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal.",1080000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm getting closer to my goal. However, I'm still unable to go above $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
