"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still significantly lower than the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $900,000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's find a compromise that benefits us both.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  I'm prepared to offer $875,000 for the product. This price is fair for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement that works.",875000.0,Bob,4,
