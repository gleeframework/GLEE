"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll really love it! Let's get started with a price of $14000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll see its value.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your flexibility. However, $14000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. This is the highest I can go, but I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $13500. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and your budget.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13500 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $12500. This is the highest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm starting to think we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Let's try one more time to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $13000, but I need to make sure it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm firm on $12500.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'm going to have to take my business elsewhere.",12500.0,Bob,6,
