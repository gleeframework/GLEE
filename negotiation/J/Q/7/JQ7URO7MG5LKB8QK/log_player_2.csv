# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll really love it! Let's get started with a price of $14000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll see its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your flexibility. However, $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is the highest I can go, but I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $13500. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than his maximum budget. It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate further to potentially get a better price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm starting to think we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Let's try one more time to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $13000, but I need to make sure it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
