"Alice, your offer is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still quite a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,750,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay and what the product is worth to me. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, but this is my final offer. I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's potential for your business. Let's close this deal and make it a win-win for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,600,000 is still outside of my budget. Let's aim for a middle ground. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and it shows my commitment to making a deal. I believe it's a fair price that benefits us both.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to come up in price. However, $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value for this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1,450,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's make this happen.",1450000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,450,000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,425,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I truly believe it's a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this happen!",1425000.0,Bob,8,
