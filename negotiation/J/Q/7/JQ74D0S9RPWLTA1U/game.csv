"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $15000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down a bit, but $15000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $12000. It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
