"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. ",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a significant reduction and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,600,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and my budget constraints.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,500,000? This allows us both to benefit from the deal.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still hesitant at $1,500,000. Let's meet in the middle at $1,450,000. This would be a good compromise and allow us both to close the deal.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
