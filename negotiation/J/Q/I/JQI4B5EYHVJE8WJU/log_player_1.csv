Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more. I'm also aware that the product is worth more to Bob, so I'm confident we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $975,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more than $950,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would have preferred a higher price, $960,000 is a good deal.  It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price and a reasonable compromise considering Bob's previous counteroffers. Selling to John would only yield $800,000, so this is the best option available."
