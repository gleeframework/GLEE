"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  This product is worth a lot to me, but I believe it will be very valuable to your business as well. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $600,000? I believe it's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $600,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This price reflects both the value of the product and the potential it holds for your business. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle ground. However, I'm aiming for a price closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit more? ",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $700,000 is a significant improvement, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we split the difference at $750,000?  This price allows me to move forward while still giving you a great deal on a product that will bring significant value to your business. I'm confident it's a win-win scenario for both of us.",750000.0,Alice,5,
