Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's very fair for both of us.  I'm asking $900,000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **The offer is $900,000.** This price is a compromise - it's higher than my minimum of $800,000, but lower than Bob's estimated value of $1,000,000. 
* **The message is friendly and persuasive.** It highlights the value of the product for Bob and emphasizes that the offer is fair. 

**Why this strategy is good:**

* **Maximizes potential profit:** This offer gives me a higher profit than selling to John while still being attractive to Bob.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob may be willing to pay closer to his estimated value if he really wants the product. 
* **Preserves a good relationship:** A fair offer helps maintain a good relationship with Bob, even if he ultimately decides not to buy."
