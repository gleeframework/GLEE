Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer you $750,000 for the product, which still allows you a good profit margin.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
