"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to give you a discount. I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John at $15,000. There's room to negotiate with Alice and try to get a price closer to her $10,000 value."
