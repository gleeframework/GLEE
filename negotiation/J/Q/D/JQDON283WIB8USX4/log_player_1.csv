"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for negotiation room and sets a high expectation for Bob. I believe it's a good starting point to see if he's truly interested and willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly closer to my minimum price, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I believe there's room to negotiate further, and rejecting his offer will allow me to make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,900,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to meet halfway, but it still keeps the price above my minimum. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and we're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation. I'm accepting this offer as it's a good compromise and allows me to secure a sale above my minimum threshold."
