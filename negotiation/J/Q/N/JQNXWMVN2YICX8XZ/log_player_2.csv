"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly better than buying from John for $1,500,000.  You save $300,000 by accepting Alice's offer, even though it's still above the product's value to Alice."
