``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate. It also sets a positive tone by emphasizing the value Bob places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still below my desired target. I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. $1,100,000 is a fair price, but I'm hoping we can find a compromise that's a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000. This is a significant investment for you, and I believe this price reflects the value you'll receive. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,075,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $1,075,000 is still a decent price, it's getting too close to my minimum and the risk of further negotiation with Bob is high. It's best to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John and avoid the potential of a lower final price with Bob."
