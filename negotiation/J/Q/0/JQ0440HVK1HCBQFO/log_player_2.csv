"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-quality product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12000. Would you like to accept or make a counteroffer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $12,000, and John is offering the product for that price, there's no point in negotiating with Alice. You can secure the product at your maximum price point immediately."
