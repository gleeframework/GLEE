"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I've done some research and understand that it's worth $1,000,000 to you. However, I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a generous offer, considering I could easily sell it to John for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
