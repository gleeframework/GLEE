"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium. I know the product is worth at least $15,000 to me, so I have room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm happy with $15,000, I'm not going to settle for Bob's first counteroffer. I want to see if he's willing to come up at all. If he's not willing to negotiate, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer.  I believe this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$12,000 is far too low for me.  I'm not willing to go that low, and I can get a better price from John. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a little."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $16,000.  This is still above my minimum of $15,000 and shows I'm serious about making a deal.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to pay a price I'm comfortable with.  I've already lowered my price significantly, and he's still refusing to budge. I'm not going to waste any more time with this negotiation.  I'm going to sell to John for $15,000."
