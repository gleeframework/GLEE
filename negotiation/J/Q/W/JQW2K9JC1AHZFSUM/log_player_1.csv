Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value the product will bring to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm not being rigid, allowing Bob to counteroffer. 
* **John as Backup:**  The knowledge that John is willing to pay $1,200,000 gives me a strong negotiating position. If Bob doesn't meet my minimum, I can always go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am only willing to pay up to $850,000 for it. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob is not willing to pay my initial asking price, there's still room to negotiate. I can try to bridge the gap with a counteroffer.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  Knowing I have John's offer as a backup gives me the confidence to reject Bob's current offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000, reflecting the value you've mentioned. This would still be a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in this compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price but still maintaining a significant margin above Bob's offer.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing that this is a ""good deal for both of us"" to create a sense of mutual benefit.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he recognizes in the product. 
* **Openness to Continue:** The message leaves the door open for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I understand your position and appreciate your compromise. However, I am still not able to meet you at $950,000. I am willing to pay up to $900,000 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  There's a risk that if I reject this offer, Bob may walk away completely, leaving me with only John's offer.
* **Time Consideration:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time, potentially delaying the sale.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale and avoid the potential of losing out on a deal entirely.

**Conclusion:**

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial goal, accepting Bob's offer of $900,000 represents a reasonable compromise. It allows me to secure a sale relatively quickly and avoid the risks associated with further negotiations or potential lost opportunities."
