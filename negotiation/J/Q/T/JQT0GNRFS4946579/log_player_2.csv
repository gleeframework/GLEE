"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning:

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Rejection allows for negotiation.** By rejecting, Bob can try to get a better price.
* **John is a backup option.** If negotiation fails, Bob can still buy from John, although it's not the most ideal scenario."

Alice's offer:

Reasoning:

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** Although it's closer to Bob's target, $1,100,000 is still above Bob's ideal price.
* **Further negotiation is possible.** There's room for both parties to compromise further.
* **John remains a fallback option.**  Bob can still purchase from John if negotiation fails."
