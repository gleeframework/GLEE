"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Potential for Better Deal:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  There's still room for negotiation as Alice values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** By rejecting the offer, Bob can make a counteroffer and try to secure a lower price. This gives him more control over the negotiation.
* **Avoiding John's Offer:** Buying from John immediately would cost Bob $1,500,000. There's a good chance Bob can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Logic:** Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  A $100,000 reduction from Alice's offer is a reasonable starting point, showing Bob is serious about negotiating but also acknowledging the product's value.
* **Room for Compromise:** This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation, which could lead to a price more favorable to Bob. 
* **Avoiding John:**  This counteroffer is still lower than John's price, making it a better option for Bob at this stage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,400,000 is still a good deal for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $1,500,000.  Here's why accepting is the best option:

* **Significant Savings:**  Accepting this offer saves Bob $100,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiations:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject his next offer, forcing him to either accept her final counteroffer (which might be higher) or buy from John at the higher price.
* **Limited Downside:**  The potential upside of further negotiations is limited, while the downside is accepting a higher price or losing the deal altogether.

It's a good idea for Bob to accept Alice's counteroffer and secure the product at a price that's still favorable."
