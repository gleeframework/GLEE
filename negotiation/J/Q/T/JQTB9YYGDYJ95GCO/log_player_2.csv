"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $140 is cheaper than buying from John for $150. 
* Even though Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($100), it's still within your budget and saves you money compared to the alternative."
