"Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a product that's truly unique. I believe its value is well above $1200000, but I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1500000. I'm confident that this price reflects the product's potential and offers you significant upside. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I think $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 is simply too low for me.  While I'm open to negotiation, I need to consider the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This price acknowledges your budget while still allowing me to  make a fair profit.  I'm confident this is a win-win scenario.  Let's keep the conversation going.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1250000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway.  However, $1250000 is still a little below what I need to feel comfortable with the deal.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $1300000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  I'm confident that this product will be worth more to you than this price in the long run.  Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1300000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1280000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1280000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1280000 is still a bit below what I need to close this deal. To finalize this, I'm willing to accept $1290000. This represents a slight concession on my end, but it also keeps the deal within a reasonable range for both of us. Let's finalize this agreement and move forward.",1290000.0,Alice,7,
