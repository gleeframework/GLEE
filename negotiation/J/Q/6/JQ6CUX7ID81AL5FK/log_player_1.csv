"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale! I'm offering it to you for $180.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** Using a friendly and encouraging message to build rapport.
* **Open-ended question:** Asking an open-ended question invites Bob to engage and potentially share his thoughts on the value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:** While it's lower than my initial offer, $150 is still above my minimum of $120.  
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Avoiding a quick sale:** Selling to John for $120 would be a safe option, but I want to see if I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $165.  This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 165}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not by too much.
* **Value proposition:** Emphasizing the product's value and highlighting the ""great deal"" reinforces the worth of the price.
* **Positive tone:** Using a friendly tone continues to build rapport and encourage negotiation.
* **Open-ended question:** This encourages Bob to engage and potentially make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $155? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:** Bob's offer of $155 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Potential for higher price:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate a price closer to my initial target.  
* **Limited rounds:**  We're approaching the middle of the negotiation rounds, and I want to avoid selling to John prematurely."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concerns.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $160?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's a great deal on this product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Offering to split the difference shows a willingness to meet halfway and demonstrates flexibility.
* **Fairness appeal:** Emphasizing that the price is ""fair for both of us"" strengthens the appeal and makes the offer seem reasonable.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation positive.
* **Direct question:** This urges Bob to respond and hopefully accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $152? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $152
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still above $120.
* **Few rounds remaining:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to be strategic. I want to see if I can push for a higher price.
* **Potential for higher price:** I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob, and I don't want to sell to John for a lower price just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $152 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $157.  This is my final offer before I consider other options.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 157}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** Stating this is my ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to take action.
* **Slight compromise:** While still above his last offer, it demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Alternative option:**  Mentioning that I'm considering ""other options"" (selling to John) subtly adds pressure.
* **Direct language:** The clear statement ""Let me know if you're interested"" prompts Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited rounds:**  With only two rounds remaining, the pressure is on to make a decision.  
* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer is only $3 above my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Unlikely to get a better offer:**  Given Bob's repeated resistance to higher prices, it's unlikely I'll get a significantly better offer in the next round.
* **Risk of selling to John:**  If I reject Bob's offer and try to counter, there's a risk that we won't reach an agreement, and I'll be forced to sell to John for $120. 

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision at this point. It secures a sale above my minimum and avoids the risk of ending up with a lower price from John."
