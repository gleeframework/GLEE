"Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $150 for the product. Alice's offer of $125 is better than John's offer of $150, but it's still more than you're willing to pay. You want to save as much money as possible, so you should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price or find another seller."
