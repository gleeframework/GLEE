"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $110? ",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand where you're coming from, but $110 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $130 is still a bit higher than my budget.  How about $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
