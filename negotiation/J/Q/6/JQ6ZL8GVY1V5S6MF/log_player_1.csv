Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $8000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I still have room to negotiate.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $8,500. This still represents a great value for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $8200 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has moved closer to my desired price.  While I'd prefer a bit more, accepting his offer at $8,200 is a good compromise and ensures a deal.  It's also a better outcome than selling to John for $8,000."
