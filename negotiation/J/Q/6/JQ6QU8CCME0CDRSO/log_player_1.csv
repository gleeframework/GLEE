Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I believe it offers great value at this price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price slightly higher than your minimum. This leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""great value,""  Alice subtly suggests the product is worth the asking price without directly stating it's overpriced.
* **Open-Ended Question:** ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and potentially start a dialogue, giving Alice more information to work with.

While Alice knows Bob values the product at $120, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more to avoid missing out. By starting at $150, Alice gives herself the best chance to maximize her profit."
