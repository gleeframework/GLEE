"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a fair price given the value of the product.  This would give us both a good deal. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
