Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You have an advantage knowing that the product is worth $120 to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Profit but Not Too Much:** Offering it at $100 leaves room for Bob to still get a good deal ($20 profit) while you maximize your profit beyond your minimum ($20 profit instead of $0 with John).
* **Clear and Direct Communication:** The message is concise and clearly states your offer, making it easy for Bob to understand and respond.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob, as it's a win-win situation for both of you."
