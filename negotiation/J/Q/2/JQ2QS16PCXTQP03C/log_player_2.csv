I'm starting with a counteroffer of $700,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This gives us a good starting point for negotiation and leaves room for compromise."

Alice is still asking for too much.  Even though she came down from her original price, I'm still not comfortable going above my maximum of $800,000. I'll reject and continue negotiating."
