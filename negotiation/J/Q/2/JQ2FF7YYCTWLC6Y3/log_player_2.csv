"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but  $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above John's offer ($10,000) to leave room for further negotiation but still aim for a significant saving.
* **Polite and Direct:**  The message is framed politely to maintain a good negotiating relationship with Alice. 
* **Justification:** I haven't provided a strong justification for the lower price. This could be a tactic to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate without revealing too much about my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my asking price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above John's Price:** Alice's counteroffer of $11,250 is better than her initial offer but still higher than John's price. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** There's room to negotiate further.  Alice seems willing to come down, so I'll try to push for a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Would you be willing to do $10,800? That's the best I can offer."",
""product_price"": 10800
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from $10,500 to $10,800 to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Firm but Fair:** The message implies this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency. However, I'm leaving the door open for Alice to counter if she's absolutely unwilling to go that low.
* **Close to John's Price:**  I'm aiming to get as close to John's price ($10,000) as possible to maximize my savings."
