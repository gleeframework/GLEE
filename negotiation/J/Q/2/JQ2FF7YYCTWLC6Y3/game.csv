"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but  $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my asking price. What do you say?",11250.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice. I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Would you be willing to do $10,800? That's the best I can offer.",10800.0,Bob,4,
