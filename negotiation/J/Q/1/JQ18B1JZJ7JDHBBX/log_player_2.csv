"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a deal that benefits both of us. I'm offering it to you for $1400000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* You are willing to pay a maximum of $1,500,000.
* Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is better than John's offer of $1,500,000.
* However, Alice's offer is still higher than the product's value to you ($1,200,000). 
* Therefore, it's in your best interest to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate further or explore other options."
