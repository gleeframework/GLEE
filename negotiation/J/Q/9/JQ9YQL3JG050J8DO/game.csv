,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. It's a fair price considering the product's unique features and value. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product's unique features and value, but $750000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700000. Can you consider that?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $715000, which is very close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think?",715000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of the negotiation, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that you're serious about buying the product. I can do $710000, which is my absolute limit. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to consider other options. What do you think?",710000.0,Alice,9,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession. However, I'm still not comfortable with $710000. I'd like to make a final counteroffer of $690000.
