Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $8,000.  This is our baseline.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a price of $10,000 allows room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, or he might accept if he's eager to secure the product.
* **Safety Net:** If Bob rejects the offer, we don't lose out. We have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 to John. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes a one-shot negotiation. In a real-world scenario, more complex strategies involving multiple rounds of offers and counter-offers might be employed."
