"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You can get the product for $10,000 from John, so anything less than that is a good deal.
* Alice is willing to sell for $8,000, so there's room for negotiation. 
* Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* This offer is a good middle ground between your maximum budget of $10,000 and Alice's minimum of $8,000. 
* It shows that you're serious about buying the product but are also trying to negotiate a fair price. 
* It leaves room for Alice to counter with a slightly higher price, if she's willing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's new offer of $9,200 is still better than John's price of $10,000. 
* While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll be left with no choice but to buy from John at a higher price.
* Accepting Alice's offer saves you $800 compared to buying from John."
