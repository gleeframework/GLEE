"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start the negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I agree it could be useful, $18,000 is quite steep. I'm thinking closer to $8,000 would be a fair starting point. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Perhaps we could settle around $9,500? I believe that would be a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit low for me.  Would you consider $12,500? This would be my final offer."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for understanding.  $12,500 is a bit too high for me, especially since you called it your final offer. If you're willing to meet me at $10,000, I'm ready to close the deal right now. Otherwise, I'll have to consider John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is playing hardball and using John's offer against you.  He knows your minimum and is unlikely to go higher. Since you have a guaranteed offer for $12,000 from John, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob."
