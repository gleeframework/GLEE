"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a fantastic price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You are willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is offering $9,000. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to save money."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer! I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $8,500 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You are still trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is closer to your ideal price, you can still try to negotiate lower.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer will keep the negotiation going and might lead to a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $9,000, which is a fair price considering the value to me. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a fair price for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell it to you for $9,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and the price is getting closer to your target.  Accepting the offer at $9,200 saves you a significant amount compared to buying from John and still gets you the product.  You can always try to negotiate further in the future, but it's unlikely you'll get a better deal than this."
