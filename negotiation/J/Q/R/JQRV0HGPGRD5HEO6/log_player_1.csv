Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to aim for a higher profit margin.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $115, I leave space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting in the middle.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John gives me leverage. I won't accept any offer below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price more around $110. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $110 is better than John's $100, but I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'll counter to see if I can secure a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your interest. How about we meet in the middle at $112?"",
""product_price"": 112
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting $112, I'm signaling a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I haven't gone down to his offer price, indicating that I believe the product is worth more.  
* **Close to Backup:** I'm still comfortably above John's $100 offer, so I'm not in a rushed position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Could you consider $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Enough Profit:**  $108 is still a reasonable profit margin above my minimum ($100).
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob walking away. It's unlikely I can get a significantly better offer from him. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids further back-and-forth and allows me to move on."
