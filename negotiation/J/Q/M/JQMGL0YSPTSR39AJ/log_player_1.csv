Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** $12,000 is well above your minimum of $8,000, ensuring you make a decent profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** By not asking for the full $15,000, you signal that you're open to negotiation and encourage Bob to counter.
* **It's still attractive to Bob:**  $12,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $15,000. 

By offering this price, I'm maximizing my chances of getting a good deal while also keeping the negotiation process open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $10,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price. I believe I can get closer to my desired amount with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to drop my price too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $9,500 is a decent compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer and gets me closer to my desired price point.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will only result in a lower price, so accepting Bob's offer is the best option."
