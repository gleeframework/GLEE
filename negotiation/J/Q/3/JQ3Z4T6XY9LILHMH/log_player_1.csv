"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested and if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer down in the following rounds.  It's important to remember that my minimum acceptable price is $800,000, which I can get from John if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a decent amount, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a compromise, but still a significant amount for Bob.  I'm hoping he sees the value of the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are consistently lower than my minimum acceptable price. I've already made a significant compromise in the previous round and I'm not sure if I can get closer to my target price with Bob.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $800,000, which guarantees me a secure and acceptable profit."
