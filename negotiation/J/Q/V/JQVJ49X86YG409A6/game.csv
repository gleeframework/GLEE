"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good outcome. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
