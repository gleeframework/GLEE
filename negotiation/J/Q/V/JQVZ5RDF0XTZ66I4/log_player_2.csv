"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $115, which is a great deal. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $115 is tempting, you can get the product for a guaranteed $100 from John.  Since your goal is to save money and the product's value is capped at $100 for you, buying from John is the most financially sensible option."
