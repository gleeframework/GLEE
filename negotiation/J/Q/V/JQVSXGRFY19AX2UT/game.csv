"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of great value. I'm offering it to you for $20000. This price reflects the product's quality and potential. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $8000 for it. Would you consider reducing the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $8000 is significantly lower than what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $14000? This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit while providing you with a fair deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Given the current situation, I'd like to propose a price of $10000 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $10000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be, but I want to make this work.  Let's compromise at $12000. It's a fair price that considers both our needs.",12000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer.  I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $11500. This is a fair price that considers both our positions.  I hope you'll find it acceptable.",11500.0,Alice,7,
