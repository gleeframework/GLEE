,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob. However, I have to make a living, and I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it's the most I can afford. Let's make a deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I was thinking that $1,150,000 is a bit too low considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit more than that. How about we meet at $1,275,000? It's a fair price, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal happen.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a reasonable price, but $1,275,000 is still more than I'm able to pay.  I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's finalize this deal and avoid going back and forth any further.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let's see if we can make it work at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
