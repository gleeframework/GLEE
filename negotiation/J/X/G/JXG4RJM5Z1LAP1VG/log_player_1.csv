Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,800,000, which is my previous counteroffer. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

While I could push for more, Bob is unlikely to go higher. Accepting the $1,800,000 offer ensures a significant profit and avoids the risk of losing both Bob and John as buyers."
