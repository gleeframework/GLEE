**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting very close to my target price, but it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  With only three rounds remaining, the chance of getting the price down to $10,000 is slim. 

It's better to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $10,000. This guarantees I get the product at my ideal price and avoids further negotiation that might not be successful."
