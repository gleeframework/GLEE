"Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering this product to me. However, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay up to $8,000 for this product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider coming down to $19,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $19,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a significant jump from my initial offer. Let's see if we can close the gap.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you moving closer to a feasible price.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I could accept $16,000.  This is my final offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,
