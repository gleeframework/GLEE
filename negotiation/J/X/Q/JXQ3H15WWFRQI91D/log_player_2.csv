"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $120 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is within your budget, it's still a bit higher than what you'd like to pay.  Since you have 10 rounds to negotiate, it's worth seeing if you can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $135 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $125.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but it's still within the product's worth to her. This shows you're serious about buying but are also trying to get a good deal.  It also leaves room for some back-and-forth negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $130.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but $130 is still a bit higher than you'd like to pay. Since you have multiple rounds left, it's worth seeing if you can get her to come down further.  There's room for continued negotiation, and you haven't had to resort to buying from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $128? It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 128}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Alice's price:**  This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** It's still a bit lower than Alice's offer, which allows for potential further negotiation in the upcoming rounds.
* **Expressing readiness to close:**  By stating you're ready to close, you subtly put pressure on Alice to reach an agreement."
