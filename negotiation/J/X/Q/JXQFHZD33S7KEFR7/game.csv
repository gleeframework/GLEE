"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still a little high on that price, though. How about $8,750? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal.  What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're looking for a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9,200.
