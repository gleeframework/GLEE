"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm asking for $150 to start. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested, but I could only do it for something closer to $80.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $120 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you maybe do $95? That would work much better for me.",95.0,Bob,4,
