Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $120 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you maybe do $95? That would work much better for me.
