This is a starting point. I'm aiming high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me.  I'm hoping to get a better price than John's offer, but I'm prepared to accept a lower price if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $1,000,000 is a decent price, I'm still hopeful that I can get a better deal with Bob. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but I'm showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to come up with a higher counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob has come up to $1,100,000, which is a significant improvement from his initial offer. It's still lower than I'd like, but it's getting closer to my desired price. It's also more than what John is offering, so it's a good deal for me.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
