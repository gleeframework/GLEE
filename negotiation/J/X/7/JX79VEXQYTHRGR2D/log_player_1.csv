While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer to see if we can find common ground."

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm running the risk of going back and forth for too long.  I'm confident John will buy the product for my desired price, so I'll take the guaranteed deal and sell to him."
