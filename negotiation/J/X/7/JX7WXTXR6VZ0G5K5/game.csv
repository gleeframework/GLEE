"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900000 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000.  This is a fair price that still allows me to recoup my investment.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
