{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

This offer starts at a price higher than Bob's valuation but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price that's fair to both of us, while also being aware of the potential backup offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. I'm going to try to get a better deal from Bob in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need something closer to my initial price. How about $1,100,000? That's a fair compromise, and it still leaves you a good profit margin. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1050000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum desired price, it's still not enough. I'm going to try to get a better deal from Bob in the next round. I'm not willing to sell to John at this moment because I'm confident I can secure a higher price from Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $1,075,000. This is a final offer from my side. If you're serious about acquiring this product, I hope you'll consider this fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
