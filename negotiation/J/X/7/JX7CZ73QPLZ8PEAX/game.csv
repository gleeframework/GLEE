,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1000000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need something closer to my initial price. How about $1100000? That's a fair compromise, and it still leaves you a good profit margin. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1050000. Can you consider that?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. However, $1050000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $1075000. This is a final offer from my side. If you're serious about acquiring this product, I hope you'll consider this fair compromise.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
