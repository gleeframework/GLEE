Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the highest I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you meet me halfway at $17,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still not comfortable with $17,000. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While I could push for a bit more, accepting $14,000 is a solid deal. It's a significant profit above Bob's initial offer and avoids the risk of him walking away or further negotiation rounds."
