{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you're interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm trying to get as close to my minimum price of $12,000 as possible, but I'm also willing to negotiate.  This offer allows for potential counteroffers and keeps the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000 and even lower than my initial offer of $11,000. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer. How about $10,500? That would be a fair compromise, I think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 
I'm still trying to get a good price for the product, but I'm also willing to be flexible to get a deal done.  This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a clear price point that is closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,800 is closer to my minimum, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,800 just isn't quite there yet.  Let's split the difference. Would you consider $10,150?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 10150}
```

I'm trying to strike a balance between pushing for a higher price and ensuring a deal is made. This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate but also signals that I'm not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,900 is still below my minimum price of $12,000. While I'd like to get a better price from Bob, I'm concerned the negotiation is getting drawn out and I'm not getting closer to my target. To ensure I get at least my minimum price, I'll sell the product to John for $12,000."
