"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. It's still a great deal for me, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $8,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's still a fair price for a product worth $10,000 to you. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
