"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000. I understand this is a valuable asset to you, and I believe this price reflects its true worth.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer who's also keen on acquiring it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same as John's. There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. You'll get the same product for the same price from either seller. Therefore, it's better to reject Alice's offer to keep your options open. You might be able to negotiate a lower price with John or find another seller."
