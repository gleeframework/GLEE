Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's attractive to Bob while still maximizing your profit. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can afford to be a bit bolder.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This represents a significant investment but also a significant opportunity. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Tone:**  The message starts by highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's ""unique value proposition."" 
* **Justification:** By saying ""a significant investment but also a significant opportunity,"" you acknowledge the high price while framing it as worthwhile.
* **High Anchor:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. You can always come down slightly and still be above your guaranteed price from John.

**Important Note:** This is just one offer strategy. You can adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's negotiation style and risk tolerance."
