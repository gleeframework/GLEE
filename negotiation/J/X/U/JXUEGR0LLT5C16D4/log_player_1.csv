Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

This offer is a starting point.  It's above your minimum price of $120, but leaves room for negotiation.  It also acknowledges that the product is worth more to Bob, giving him an incentive to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, you can likely get a better price. Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to your desired $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise.  It's higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than your initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate.  It also keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $3 less than your previous counteroffer. At this point, it's likely that continuing to negotiate will only result in further concessions and potentially a lower price. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit that's reasonably close to your desired price."
