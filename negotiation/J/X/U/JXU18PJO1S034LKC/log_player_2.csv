Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is significantly higher than I'm prepared to pay. I understand the value of this product, but  $800,000 is my absolute maximum.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and acknowledging the product's value. While I understand your perspective, the $800,000 price point doesn't reflect the full potential this product offers.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its true worth.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than my budget.  While she has lowered the price, it's still not close to a point where I'd be comfortable accepting. I'll continue to try and negotiate a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $2,000,000 is still out of my price range. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $800,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be straightforward. To make this work for me, the price needs to be significantly closer to my valuation.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's closer to my budget, it's not yet within the range I'm comfortable with. I'll continue negotiating with Alice and see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise further, but $1,750,000 is still outside my budget.  I can't go higher than $1,000,000.
