"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it, considering its value to me and your potential profit. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $825,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my initial offer.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer $800,000, which would give you a good profit margin and still represent a significant saving for me.  Let's finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'll offer you a compromise: I'll meet you at $815,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",815000.0,Alice,5,
