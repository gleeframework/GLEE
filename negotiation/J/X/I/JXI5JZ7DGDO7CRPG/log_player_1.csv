Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer from another party."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,150,000 is:
    *  Above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
    *  Significantly below my guaranteed sale price, ensuring a profit even if there's a slight discount.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** Mentioning another offer creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept quickly."
