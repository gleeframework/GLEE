"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This sets a strong initial point for negotiation and gives me room to lower the price if necessary.  It's also important to remember that I have a backup option with John, so I don't have to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,800,000 is a lot closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get more. It's still early in the negotiation, and I have several rounds left to try and get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm confident that this is a fair price given the product's value to me."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1875000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,875,000. This is a small move, but it shows Bob that I'm serious about getting as close to my ideal price as possible.  It's also a good compromise point - it's halfway between my previous offer and his."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's getting close, and we're running out of rounds. Accepting this offer guarantees me a good profit and avoids the risk of having to sell to John for a lower price."
