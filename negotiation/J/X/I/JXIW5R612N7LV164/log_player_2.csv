"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $800,000 to you, and Alice is asking for $900,000. This is a significant markup. 
* It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. 
* Buying from John immediately would mean paying the full value, so it's better to try negotiating with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $750,000.  This would give us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to show Alice that I'm serious about negotiating.
* $750,000 is still a decent profit for Alice, as her value is $800,000.
* This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to make this deal work.  This price still allows me a decent profit and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but $850,000 is still too high. 
* I'm willing to continue negotiating and hope to reach a price closer to my value of $800,000.
* Buying from John now would mean paying the full value, and I still have a chance to get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm getting closer to your price, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $825,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer.
* This shows a willingness to compromise and suggests that I'm serious about closing the deal.
* $825,000 is still a good profit for Alice, as she values the product at $800,000.
* This counteroffer gives Alice some room to negotiate further if needed."
