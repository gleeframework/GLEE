"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $750,000.  This would give us both a good deal. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to make this deal work.  This price still allows me a decent profit and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's make this happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I'm getting closer to your price, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $825,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. What do you say?",825000.0,Bob,4,
