"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a good starting point because it's a significant discount from Bob's estimated value, but still leaves me with a decent profit margin.  I'm aiming to find a middle ground that's appealing to Bob while still maximizing my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is still above my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm not in a rush to sell and can continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $9,000.  This is a smaller concession than Bob's last offer, and hopefully, it will signal to him that I'm serious about getting a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $7,800 is too low for me.  While I'm not getting my ideal price, selling to John for $8,000 ensures I meet my minimum and don't risk further negotiation with Bob."
