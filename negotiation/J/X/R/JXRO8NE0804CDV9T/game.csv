"Alice,  $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I understand the value of this product, but I'm only willing to pay $850,000 at this point. This is a fair price that reflects both of our interests. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good middle ground. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",875000.0,Alice,3,
