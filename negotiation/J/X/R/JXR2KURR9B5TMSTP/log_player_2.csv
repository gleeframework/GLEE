"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $14,000, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  While $14,000 is lower than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?  I think this would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's still a bit above his ideal price, it's significantly lower than John's offer, and likely closer to the middle ground he can reach."
