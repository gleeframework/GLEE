"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $2,000 above your maximum price. 
* It's too early to buy from John, as we haven't explored any counteroffers yet. 
* Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $9,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still $1,000 above my maximum price of $10,000. 
* It's still too early to buy from John, as we are making progress in negotiation.
* Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $10,000, which is my maximum budget.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my willingness to purchase it immediately.  Let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $10,500. This is a compromise that takes into account your maximum budget and the product's value. I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $500 over my maximum budget. 
* We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and it's unlikely I'll be able to get a lower price from Alice.
* John is offering the product at my maximum budget, so it's a better deal to buy from him and avoid further negotiation."
