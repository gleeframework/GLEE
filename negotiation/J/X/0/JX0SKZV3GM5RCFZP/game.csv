"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $9,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $10,000, which is my maximum budget.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my willingness to purchase it immediately.  Let's close the deal at this price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $10,500. This is a compromise that takes into account your maximum budget and the product's value. I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
