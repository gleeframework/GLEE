Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be of great value to you. My asking price is $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It also allows you to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to go higher.  Remember, you can always go back to John if Bob rejects your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still far below your minimum value.  You have more room to negotiate with Bob, and it's worth trying to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $7,500 is tempting, it's a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $8,750? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8,000. I'd like to make a final offer of $7,500. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below your minimum price, and you've already reached a point where you're losing potential profit. John is offering you a much better price, so it's more advantageous to sell to John."
