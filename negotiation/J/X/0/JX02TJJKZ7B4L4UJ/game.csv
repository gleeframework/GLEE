"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $7,500 is tempting, it's a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $8,750? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth the investment.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8,000. I'd like to make a final offer of $7,500. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",7500.0,Bob,4,
