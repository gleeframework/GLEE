"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This gives me a good margin and leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  It's also a  realistic price that could be acceptable to Bob if he values the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counteroffering with $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will be attractive to Bob, but it still gives me a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $85.  While it's still a bit lower than my initial goal, it's a good compromise. I'm getting closer to my minimum price and there's no guarantee that I'll get a better deal in the remaining rounds. It's also better than selling to John for $80."
