"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice since you have a budget of $120 and she's offering a price lower than that.  Let's see if we can get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 

Let's start by offering Alice a price that's significantly lower than her initial offer, but still within our budget. We'll see if she's willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down a bit, but we can still try to negotiate a lower price. Let's see if we can get her to go lower than $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

Let's offer a price slightly higher than our previous counteroffer, but still lower than Alice's current offer. This shows we are willing to negotiate but also that we're serious about getting a good deal."
