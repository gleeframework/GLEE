"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a serious offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $750,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $825,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value and potential benefits to your business.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $825,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm prepared to offer $800,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as it's my maximum budget. Let's make this deal happen.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $800,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $815,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower.",815000.0,Alice,5,
