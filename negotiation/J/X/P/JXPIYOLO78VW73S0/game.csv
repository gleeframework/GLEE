"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant value.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $11,000. It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
