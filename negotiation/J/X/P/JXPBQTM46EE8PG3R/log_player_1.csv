{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $12,000 but below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It leaves room for negotiation while still being a profitable deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it's getting closer. Given the risk of further negotiation failing and needing to sell to John for $15,000, I'll accept Bob's offer to secure a sale and avoid potential delays."
