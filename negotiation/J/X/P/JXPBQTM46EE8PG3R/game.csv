"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!",13000.0,Bob,4,
