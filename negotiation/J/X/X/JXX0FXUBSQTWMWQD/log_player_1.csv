"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively high price of $15,000.  This is a strong opening offer that allows for potential negotiation while still ensuring I get more than my minimum desired amount.  Since I don't know Bob's perceived value, this allows me to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to accept it right away. I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more profit. Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate, so I'll see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, but still gives me a decent profit margin. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not going to give in easily."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer to $12,500.  While this is still lower than I'd like, it's only $500 less than my minimum acceptable price and we're already halfway through the rounds.  It's likely that I won't be able to get much more from Bob, so I'll accept his offer."
