"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a price below its worth to you, and I get a fair price for my hard work. Let's make this happen!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's below your maximum, it leaves a lot of room for negotiation.
* **Negotiation potential:** You can likely get a better price by counteroffering. 
* **No urgency:**  You have the option of buying from John if negotiations fail. 

By rejecting, you open the possibility of getting the product for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to compromise further, but I need to get at least $900,000 for the product.  This price still leaves you a significant profit, and it's a fair reflection of its value.  Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant savings:** Accepting Alice's offer means you save $100,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Fair price:** While Alice has lowered her price slightly, it's still a good deal for you. You're getting a product worth $1,000,000 to you for $900,000.
* **Limited room for further negotiation:**  Alice has already compromised, and further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or her going back to her original offer.

Accepting Alice's offer minimizes your risk and secures a good deal."
