{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 
 
This offer starts with a high price, but leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges that Bob might have a different value for the product. 

It's important to note that this is just a starting point. The best strategy will depend on Bob's reaction and the overall dynamics of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would you be willing to consider $9,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is a decent amount, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum of $10,000. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down to $9,250, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose $9,100 as the price for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,100 is close enough to my minimum of $10,000 that I'm willing to accept it.  It's a good compromise, and I'm not sure I can push for a higher price without risking losing the sale altogether."
