"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first.  $120 is a bit high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. We have plenty of rounds left to find a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate. I'll try to meet her halfway in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, I see you're trying to find a compromise. How about $100? That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

I'm offering Alice her value for the product. This might be our best shot at getting the best possible deal without dragging the negotiation on too long."
