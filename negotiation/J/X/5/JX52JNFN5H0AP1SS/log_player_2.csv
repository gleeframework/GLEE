# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Buying from Alice at $120 is cheaper than buying from John at $150.
* **You're still getting a good deal.** You value the product at $150, and you can get it for $120, saving $30."
