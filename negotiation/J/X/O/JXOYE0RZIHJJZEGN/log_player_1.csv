Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($120). 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This allows for a back-and-forth where I can potentially increase the price closer to my desired amount. 
* **Building rapport:** Starting with a friendly message helps set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** It's below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Potential for a counteroffer:** I'm still hopeful to get a better price from Bob. There's room for negotiation. 
* **John is a backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay $120 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $80 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $90? It's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for both of us.
* **Open communication:** I'm keeping the communication open and friendly to encourage further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiating room:** Even though it's closer, there's still room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is safe:** John's offer of $120 is a good fallback option if negotiations with Bob ultimately fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to go down to $95.  This is really my final offer, as I'm confident the product is worth more. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** I'm signaling this is my last offer to create pressure on Bob. 
* **Small concession:** I'm making a small concession to show I'm still willing to compromise, but not giving in too much.
* **Confidence in the product:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to reinforce its worth.
* **Directness:** I'm asking for a clear decision to avoid further back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $87 for the product. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not enough:** Bob's offer of $87 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below it.
* **Risk of going lower:**  Continuing to negotiate could result in a price that is too low and not worth the effort.
* **John's offer is secure:**  John is willing to pay my minimum price, guaranteeing my desired profit.  Selling to John is the safest and most profitable option at this point."
