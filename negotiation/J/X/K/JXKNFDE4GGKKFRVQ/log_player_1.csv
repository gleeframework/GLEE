Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product is incredibly valuable and could benefit you greatly. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, trying to sell to Bob first allows me to potentially earn even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers him a substantial discount from my minimum price and John's offer. 
* **Anchoring Bias:**  By starting with a high initial offer, I aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value, making him more receptive to a price that's still very beneficial to me. 

This strategy attempts to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and ensuring the sale doesn't fall through, leading to a potentially lower profit with John."
