Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at $15,000 might make Bob feel like he's not getting any deal, potentially pushing him away.
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, selling at $13,000 or $13,500 is still significantly more profitable than selling to John for $12,000."
