Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This leaves room for negotiation, but still ensures I make a profit above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm confident Bob will be interested as the product is worth $12,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $11,000 is still a good deal for me, exceeding my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation, potentially leading to a lower price or a deal falling through altogether."
