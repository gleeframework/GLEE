"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $15000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14000. Let me know if this is something you'd be comfortable with.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $13000? That's my absolute maximum, and I think it's a fair price considering we're both willing to compromise.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I'd like to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13500. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",13500.0,Alice,5,
