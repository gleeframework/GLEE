It's always worth exploring if you can get a better deal, even if it's just a little better.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

You're still $1,000 above your ideal price, and John is offering the product for your maximum.  Rejecting and counter-offering again gives you another chance to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I'd like to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13500. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is only $1,500 more than your desired price.  This is a good deal, and you could potentially save $1,500 by accepting. While further negotiation is possible, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price. It's a calculated risk, but accepting the offer is likely the best move here."
