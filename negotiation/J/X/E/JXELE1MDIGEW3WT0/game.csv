"I understand you're working with a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit off. How about $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,075,000. I'm willing to go a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's worth to you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
