"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I can offer you a compromise at $13,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $12,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $13,250. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",13250.0,Alice,5,
