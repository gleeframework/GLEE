Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $780,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $825,000 is a bit too high, but I can do $810,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.

We've gone back and forth a few times now, and Alice is clearly holding firm around the $810,000 mark. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice won't budge much, and I might end up losing the deal altogether. At $810,000, I'm still getting a significant discount compared to John's offer."
