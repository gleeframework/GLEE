"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $700,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking!",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly.  Would you be willing to consider $750,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $750,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $825,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. It seems like we're getting closer. How about we settle at $780,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",780000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $780,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $825,000 is a bit too high, but I can do $810,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",810000.0,Alice,7,
