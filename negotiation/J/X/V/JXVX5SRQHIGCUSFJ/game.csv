"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. My initial offer is $18,000.  Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $14,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle at $16,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a deal. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a deal. I'm open to further discussion if you have any other proposals.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, Alice, but $14,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $13,750. Can you consider this price?",13750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $13,750 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  To show you I'm serious about making a deal, I'll come down to $14,250. This is a fair price that's closer to your offer while still allowing me to make a profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",14250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $14,250, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay that price. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider this price?",14000.0,Bob,8,
