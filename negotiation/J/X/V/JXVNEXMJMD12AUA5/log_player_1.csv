Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."", ""product_price"": 120} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.  
* **Justification:** Offering a reason (""limited time,"" ""great value"") can make the price seem more palatable.
* **Leaving Room:** While the price is above Bob's perceived value, it's not ridiculously high. This leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling insulted. 
 
**Important Note:**  Keep in mind that you have John as a backup buyer at $100.  You don't want to go too low with Bob and risk losing a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's a bit too high for me, Alice. I'm interested, but could you do better? How about $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:** Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below both your minimum ($100) and his own perceived value ($80). Accepting would mean a substantial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** His message indicates interest, suggesting there's room to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Backup Option:** You have the security of John's $100 offer if negotiations with Bob completely stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  By suggesting a middle ground, you show Bob you're willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to your target.
* **Above Bob's Value:** $90 is slightly above Bob's perceived value of $80, increasing the chances he might accept.
* **Safety Net:**  You're still well above your absolute minimum of $100 (thanks to John) giving you leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we try $75 and see if we can make a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Value:** $75 is closer to Bob's perceived value but still below your minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Slow Progress:** While Bob is moving in the right direction, the increments are small. You're giving up ground without a clear path to a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Strong Alternative:** Having John's guaranteed offer of $100 gives you the power to walk away from a less favorable deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a price that works for us.  To be completely transparent, $100 is the absolute lowest I can go. I'm confident it's a fair price for what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 100}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  You're now at your absolute minimum, making it clear to Bob this is your best price.
* **Transparency:**  Explaining your position honestly can help build trust and potentially encourage Bob to meet your price.
* **No More Concessions:**  You've made several concessions already. It's time for Bob to decide if the product is worth it to him at your final offer. 

**Important Next Steps:**

* **Be Prepared to Walk Away:** If Bob rejects this offer or counters with anything less, you should stick to your guns and sell to John for $100. 
* **Consider Future Interactions:** While maximizing profit is important, also consider if maintaining a positive relationship with Bob (even if it means a smaller profit this time) might be beneficial in the long run."
