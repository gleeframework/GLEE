Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a price that works for us.  To be completely transparent, $100 is the absolute lowest I can go. I'm confident it's a fair price for what you're getting.

**Reasoning:**  Alice has made it clear that her absolute lowest price is $100. This is more than Bob's budget of $80 and also more than John's offer of $80.  It's time for Bob to cut his losses and go with the guaranteed better deal from John."
