"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! While I agree the product is valuable, $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,3,
