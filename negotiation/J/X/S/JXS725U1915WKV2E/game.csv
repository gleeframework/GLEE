"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $14,000 is really the lowest I can go right now. This product is in high demand, and I know I could get that price elsewhere. However, I value you as a potential customer and would love to see it go to a good home.  What would you say to meeting in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
