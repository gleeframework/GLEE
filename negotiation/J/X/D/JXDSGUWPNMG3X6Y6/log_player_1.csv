Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a truly unique and valuable item, and I believe you'll find it to be a great investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $15000 for your product. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can get more. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $18,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $16500. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good starting point for us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is now closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate.  It's better to secure the sale at $16,500 than to potentially get nothing if Bob changes his mind or if I have to sell to John for the lower price."
