"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $16,000.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,000 is still slightly above my comfortable price point. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $14,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, so I'll counter with $15,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",15500.0,Alice,5,
