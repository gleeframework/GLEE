"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $9,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate you working with me.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little bit of a stretch. Would you consider $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",8000.0,Alice,5,
