"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available elsewhere. Considering its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this represents a fair opportunity for you to acquire it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is a bit lower than her product's worth to her, you have a better alternative. John is offering the product for $1,200,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can save $250,000."
