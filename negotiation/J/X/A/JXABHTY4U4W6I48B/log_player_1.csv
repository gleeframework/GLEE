Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. Ideally, you want a price closer to this to incentivize him.
* **The Zone of Agreement:**  The potential negotiation space lies between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to start high but leave room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal.  Avoid being too aggressive, as that could push Bob away.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available elsewhere. Considering its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this represents a fair opportunity for you to acquire it."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting this adds perceived value for Bob.
* **""Fair Opportunity"":**  Framing it this way avoids sounding like a demand.
* **Price:** It's below your minimum but leaves space for a counter-offer if Bob wants to negotiate further.

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, having John as a backup ensures you won't lose out."
