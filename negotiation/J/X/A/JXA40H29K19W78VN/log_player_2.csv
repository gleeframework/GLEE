"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $1,200,000.  He has a maximum budget of $1,500,000 and knows Alice is willing to sell for less than that. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $950,000 is a substantial reduction from Alice's initial price of $1,200,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but wants a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is still a good deal for Bob. While he could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially ending the negotiation is high.  At this price, Bob is saving $400,000 compared to buying from John, and there's a good chance he won't get a lower price. It's a reasonable risk to accept and secure the product."
