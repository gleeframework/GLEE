"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $650,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly unique.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still a ways off from that number.  Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. How about $750,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product is worth it.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really serious about this, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $825,000 again, but I'm only willing to go this low once more. If you're not at $825,000, I'll have to consider other options.",825000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you holding firm, but I need to be firm as well.  I can do $775,000, but that's my absolute limit.  If we can make a deal at that price, I'm ready to close.",775000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000. That's the lowest I can go. If you're not at $825,000, I'm going to have to consider other options. I'm starting to lose patience, and I'm not sure how much longer I can keep negotiating.",825000.0,Alice,9,
