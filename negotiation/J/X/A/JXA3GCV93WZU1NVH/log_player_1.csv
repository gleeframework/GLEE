Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as the product is worth $1,000,000 to you and I'm only asking for a small premium.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This is a strong starting offer. It leaves room for negotiation while still securing a profit for you. It's important to start with a price that you're happy with, but also one that leaves room for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, selling for $900,000 is below the minimum I'm willing to accept. I believe I can still get a better price by rejecting his offer and counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to accept $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Even though I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go lower than $1,000,000. John is offering a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  It's time to move on and sell to John."
