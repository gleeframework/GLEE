**Reasoning:**

Bob is incredibly unlikely to move significantly from his $1,000,000 offer. He's sticking to a slow incremental increase strategy.  Continuing the negotiation risks leaving Alice with an offer further below John's guaranteed $1,200,000. It's time to cut losses and secure the guaranteed sale."
