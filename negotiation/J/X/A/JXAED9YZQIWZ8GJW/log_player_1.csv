"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,450,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
