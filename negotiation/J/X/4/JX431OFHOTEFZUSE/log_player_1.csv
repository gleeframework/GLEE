{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's something that I believe will be invaluable to your business. My initial price is $1,750,000, which I believe reflects its true worth. I'm open to discussing the price further and finding a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, $1,750,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I will counteroffer and try to get a price closer to my desired value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,600,000 is still a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

While $1,400,000 is closer to my desired price, I can still try to push for a higher amount. I will counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 still doesn't quite cover the value I've put into this product. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,450,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
