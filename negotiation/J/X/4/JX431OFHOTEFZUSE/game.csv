"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's something that I believe will be invaluable to your business. My initial price is $1,750,000, which I believe reflects its true worth. I'm open to discussing the price further and finding a solution that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, $1,750,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,600,000 is still a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 still doesn't quite cover the value I've put into this product. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,450,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
