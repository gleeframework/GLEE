Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to start high, hoping Bob is willing to negotiate.  $110 is a bit higher than what I would get from John, but I'm hoping to get closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is better than nothing, it's far below what I consider the product to be worth. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit, but I'm still holding out for more than Bob's initial offer.  $95 is a good compromise, and it's still higher than what I'd get from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a bit more,  $85 is getting closer to my minimum value and it's higher than what Bob offered initially.  I'm going to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation."
