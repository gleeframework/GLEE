"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly enhance your business operations. Given its value and potential impact on your projects, I propose a price of $10,000 for it. This price reflects its high quality and the benefits it can bring to you. I understand its worth to you is $8,000, but I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000 and the price John is willing to sell at. By rejecting this offer, you open up the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice or simply proceeding to buy from John at your desired price point."
