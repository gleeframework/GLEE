"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and importance, I believe it's worth $12000. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $12,000 to both of us, it's in my best interest to try and negotiate a lower price. There's no immediate need to buy from John, as I have 10 rounds to work with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob. Considering the value of the product, I think we can still find a middle ground. How about we aim for $11500? This price respects the value of the product while allowing us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly, but I'm still hoping to get a better price. I have several rounds left and can continue negotiating. Buying from John right now would mean paying the full $12,000, which I'm trying to avoid."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $11,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I respect your position, Bob. Let's try to bridge the gap. How about we set the price at $11250? This acknowledges your budget constraints while ensuring a fair return for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,250, which is close to my ideal price of $11,000.  With only 5 rounds left, it's likely I won't be able to get a lower price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at the full price."
