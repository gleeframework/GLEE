"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $175 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160. This is still a great deal, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price. Let's try to make this work.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $140, which is a fair price considering my limit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $140 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $145? This is a good price for both of us, and we can finally close the deal. What do you say?",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $140, which is my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to accept that, I'm going to have to consider purchasing from John.",140.0,Bob,6,
