"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This allows for potential negotiation while giving me a comfortable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $9,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm countering with $10,500. This is still significantly higher than Bob's last offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. It's also closer to my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for further negotiation but reducing the risk of accepting a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to settle for a price that's too low. I'll counter again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm countering with $10,000. This is a compromise, acknowledging that Bob is unlikely to go much higher. It's also a good test to see if he's willing to get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push him further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10250}
```

I'm countering with $10,250. This is a small increase from my last offer, signaling that I'm flexible but also that I won't drop my price significantly. I'm hoping this will be enough to tempt Bob into accepting."
