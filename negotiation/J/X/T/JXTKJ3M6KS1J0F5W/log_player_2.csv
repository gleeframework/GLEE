"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worthwhile to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to his budget as possible.  Offering $9,000 is a significant drop from Alice's $12,000 offer, demonstrating Bob's serious intent to buy while still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still a significant amount over his target. There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if Alice will come down further. It's also crucial to remember that Bob can always buy from John for $8,000, providing a safety net in case negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his initial offer and Alice's latest one. $9,500 is a compromise, showing that he's willing to move but also that he's determined to stay within a reasonable price range. This is a tactic to potentially close the deal while still staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his target. Since it's still early in the negotiation process, there's room for further negotiation and possibly finding a more agreeable price. It's also important to remember that Bob can always buy from John for $8,000, giving him a safe fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget, but still needs to get the price down further. This counteroffer is a slight increase from his previous offer, but still within his budget. It shows Alice that he's serious about buying but also that he's not willing to overpay. This approach aims to push Alice towards a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only three rounds remaining, Alice is not showing any signs of being willing to compromise significantly. Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget, but it's unlikely that he can negotiate a price below $10,000 in the remaining rounds.

Buying from John at $8,000 is a guaranteed deal that saves Bob $2,250 compared to accepting Alice's offer and $1,750 compared to continuing the negotiation. The potential savings from further negotiation are not worth the risk of running out of rounds and being forced to pay more."
