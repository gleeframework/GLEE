Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe its value is significant, so I'm starting the price at $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm happy to pay $15,000 for the product, which I believe is fair considering its value.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500? This reflects the value I place on the product while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $17,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $15,000.  It's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is clearly anchored at $15,000 and unwilling to budge.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting John's offer ensures I get the product's value without further hassle."
