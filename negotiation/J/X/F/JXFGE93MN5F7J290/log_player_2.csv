{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,000 is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. By offering $13,000, he's showing Alice he's serious about buying but also trying to get a price closer to his target. This price is still higher than Alice's value of $12,000, leaving potential for a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is slightly higher than her previous offer. While it's still a better price than John's, Bob can still try to push for a lower price. There's room for negotiation and potentially getting a price closer to his initial counteroffer of $13,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to split the difference between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  This shows that he's willing to compromise and hopefully leads to a final deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffers are getting closer to her initial price. This suggests she may not be willing to budge much further.  Bob has already made several counteroffers, and continuing might lead to further price increases.  At this point, the savings from negotiating are minimal compared to the risk of Alice getting firm and driving the price up even more. Buying from John provides certainty and a known price, even though it's slightly higher than Alice's current offer."
