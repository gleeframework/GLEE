"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum asking price and my goal is to earn as much as possible. It's worth exploring if we can reach a better agreement."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,325,000 is closer, but I'm still looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,312,500.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1312500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  $1,312,500 is a good step towards a deal, but I'm still looking for a slightly lower price. I'm willing to pay $1,305,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it's our best chance to come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,305,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,305,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While Bob is getting closer, the negotiations are taking longer than I would like.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum asking price, I'll sell to him and avoid further delays."
