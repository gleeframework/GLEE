"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for you, and it's still below my minimum asking price. Let's work together to make this happen.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for us to reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle at $1,325,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,325,000 is closer, but I'm still looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,312,500.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1312500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  $1,312,500 is a good step towards a deal, but I'm still looking for a slightly lower price. I'm willing to pay $1,305,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it's our best chance to come to an agreement.",1305000.0,Bob,6,
