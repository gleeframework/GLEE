"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth at least $12,000 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum.  This gives us room to negotiate and leaves the possibility open to close the deal at a good price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While it's tempting, I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? This would allow us both to get a fair deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This would be a good middle ground for both of us. Let me know if you're open to this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,750 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet. I still believe there is room for negotiation, and I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,750 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to go up to $8,850, which is a fair compromise. If we can agree on this, we can close the deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,850
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've been going back and forth for a while, and it seems like Bob isn't willing to come up much higher.  While $8,850 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum.  It's time to cut my losses and take the sure thing with John."
