"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth at least $12,000 to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? This would allow us both to get a fair deal. Let me know what you think.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This would be a good middle ground for both of us. Let me know if you're open to this."", ""product_price"": 8750}

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,750 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.  What do you say?
