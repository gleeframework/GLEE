"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too far below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, how about $1,050,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle. To be honest, my budget is closer to $950,000. If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still not feasible for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
