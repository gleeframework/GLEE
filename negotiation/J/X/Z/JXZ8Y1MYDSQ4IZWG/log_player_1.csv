"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let's start our negotiation with a strong foundation."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, his offer is too low to consider. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too far below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, how about $1,050,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle. To be honest, my budget is closer to $950,000. If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures I don't lose money. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  There's still a chance to close the deal with Bob at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still not feasible for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
