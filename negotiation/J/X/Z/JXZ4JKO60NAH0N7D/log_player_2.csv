"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high for Bob. While it's a good deal for Alice, it's not within Bob's budget.  Bob should reject the offer and counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my maximum value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing us to reach an agreement. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $925,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price in the next round.  There's still room for compromise and Bob should aim to get the price down further before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $875,000. This would allow both of us to make a reasonable profit and finalize the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to find common ground here. $875,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $900,000, but this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I will be forced to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that she won't go lower than $900,000. While this is a better price than her previous offers, it's still above Bob's budget.  Since Bob has a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000, it makes more sense for him to take that option and save money. There's no guarantee that Alice will budge further, and Bob risks further negotiation without a definitive outcome."
