"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.  That's a great price considering what it's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'm interested in the product, but I'm not sure if $120 is a good deal for me. Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, I'm guessing it's worth less to me. I'd like to save as much money as possible, so I'll reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $150.
