"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and while I value it at more, I'm willing to make this concession. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer ready to pay full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Here's why:

* **You have a better alternative:** John offers the product for $800,000, which is significantly less than Alice's $1,000,000 offer. 
* **Saving money is key:** Your goal is to buy the product while saving as much as possible. Accepting Alice's offer would mean overpaying by $200,000.

While Alice's message tries to create urgency, you're better off sticking with your more affordable option."
