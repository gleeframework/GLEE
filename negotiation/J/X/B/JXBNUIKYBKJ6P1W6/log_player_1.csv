Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $950,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob accepts, I'll be very happy. If he rejects, I'll see his counteroffer and decide if it's worth pursuing further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my ideal price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm offering $900,000.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my original offer and his counteroffer.  It's still a good deal for me, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is a bit lower than I'd prefer, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price than John's offer.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to Bob for $875,000."
