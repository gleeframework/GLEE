# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.

Alice's offer is too high. I'm willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but I want to see if I can get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows me to counter-offer and potentially save some money."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,050,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to compromise. I can see that you're very interested in the product, and I'd like to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,150,000.

While Alice's counteroffer is a step in the right direction, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm aiming to get the price down closer to my target of $1,050,000.  I'll counter-offer again, hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I was thinking that $1,100,000 is still a bit low considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the same price I initially offered. If you're willing to meet me there, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,150,000 is the best price for this product. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,225,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think we're getting too close to the wire. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not sure I'm willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to make one last offer. I'll meet you at $1,200,000, which is the same price I initially offered. If you're willing to meet me there, I'll consider it a fair deal. But if not, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is sticking to her initial price, and we're running out of time. While I'd prefer to pay less, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  Buying from John guarantees I get the product, even though it's at a higher price."
