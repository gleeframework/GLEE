"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its potential value,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it. This price reflects its worth to me, while also leaving room for a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
