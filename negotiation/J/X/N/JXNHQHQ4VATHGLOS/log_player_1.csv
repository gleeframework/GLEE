Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

Since I am aiming to maximize my profit, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $800,000, there's no reason to offer a lower price to Bob. I'm offering the product for the full $800,000. This way, if Bob accepts, I get the best possible deal. If he rejects, I can still sell to John for the same amount."
