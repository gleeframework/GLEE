"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob! However, I'm not sure I can meet you exactly at $100. How about we compromise at $110? It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $105. How about we meet in the middle again, at $107.50? It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",107.5,Alice,5,

"I can see you're really close to making a decision, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go back to $105. How about we try one more time to meet in the middle? I'm willing to go down to $106.50. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this great product.",106.5,Alice,7,
