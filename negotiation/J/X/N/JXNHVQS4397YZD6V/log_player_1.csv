Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for crafting Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice will accept no less than $1,500,000 for the product.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **John's Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $1,500,000 from John.

**The Optimal Strategy**

Alice is in a strong position. She knows John will buy the product for her desired price. Therefore, Alice should aim for a price that's slightly below Bob's maximum valuation, maximizing her potential profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm offering it at $1,199,000."",
""product_price"": 1199000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** The message is polite, professional, and hints at the product's value without revealing Alice's bottom line.
* **The Price:** $1,199,000 is just under Bob's $1,200,000 valuation. This makes the offer very tempting for Bob, as it represents significant savings. 

**Why this works:**

* **High Probability of Acceptance:** This offer gives Bob a strong incentive to buy. 
* **Maximized Profit:** While Alice could ask for the full $1,200,000, setting the price slightly lower increases the likelihood of a quick and clean sale.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, Alice will sell to John without further negotiation."
