"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. Let me know if that's something you'd like to consider.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250? I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement.",11250.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go to $12,000. That's as low as I'm willing to go. Let me know if that's something you'd like to consider.",12000.0,Alice,5,
