"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down and still reach a favorable outcome. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the product's ""value and potential"" helps justify the high initial price.
* **Leaving Room:** Since you know Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and you won't go below $1,200,000, there's a good range to negotiate within."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below your aspirational selling price. You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and selling to John is a solid backup option. Rejecting this offer signals that you're aiming higher and are willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While your assessment of the product's value to me is accurate, I believe its potential for you warrants a higher investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Counter:** It's good practice to acknowledge Bob's offer and show you're engaging in the negotiation seriously.
* **Standing Firm (For Now):**  The counteroffer of $1,500,000 keeps the negotiation moving but doesn't concede too much ground at once. 
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  Suggesting a middle ground can sometimes help break stalemates and encourage the other party to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and its potential for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly negotiating strategically and incrementally increasing his offer. However, $1,350,000 is still a significant difference from your target price. You have the leverage of John's offer and enough rounds to hold your ground a bit longer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. To be candid, I have another potential buyer who is prepared to offer $1,200,000.  In the spirit of our discussions, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,450,000.  This feels like a fair offer given the product's potential."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing a Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning John's offer, you introduce a sense of urgency and competition, potentially motivating Bob to increase his offer.
* **Slight Concession:** You are showing a willingness to move from your previous offer, indicating you're aiming for a deal. 
* **Final Strong Position:**  This offer is a strong position - it's a significant gain from Bob's last offer while still leaving you some negotiating room if needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, I'm still not comfortable with the offer. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, and you're willing to sell it to another buyer for $1,200,000, I believe I can get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your latest offer, so I'll propose $1,225,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's potential and the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to use your disclosure of John's offer to his advantage.  He's now trying to anchor the negotiation too close to your absolute minimum. While you've made concessions, he needs to understand that you value the product's potential for him.  Rejecting this offer maintains a firm stance and signals that his current proposal is unacceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but your last offer doesn't reflect the real value of this product, particularly given its potential in your hands. I'm willing to make one final concession at $1,300,000.  This is my bottom line.  I believe it's a fair offer and a good opportunity for you to capitalize on everything this product has to offer."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** You're signaling that this is your final offer, adding a sense of urgency to the negotiation.
* **Justification:** By reiterating the product's potential value for Bob, you're reminding him why he was interested in the first place.
* **Firm but Fair:** The $1,300,000 price is a significant compromise on your part, but it still represents a considerable profit beyond your minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Constraint:** With only a few rounds left, you need to push Bob towards a decision while still leaving room for him to accept a price above your fallback option (John)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're willing to make one final concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your latest offer, so I'll propose $1,275,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's potential and the value it holds for me. I'm willing to make a final concession, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to accept.  Here's why:

* **Strong Profit:** While not your ideal price, $1,275,000 is a $75,000 profit over your guaranteed offer from John.
* **Bob's Signals:** Bob has consistently moved upwards, even if incrementally. His language about a ""final concession"" and ""budget"" suggests he's nearing his limit.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing might yield a slightly better price, but there's a risk of Bob walking away entirely. You've reached a point of diminishing returns.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:**  Accepting now secures a good deal.  Pushing further for a small gain carries the risk of losing Bob and having to settle for John's offer."
