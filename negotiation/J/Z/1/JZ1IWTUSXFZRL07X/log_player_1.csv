Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives me room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than my minimum acceptable value:** This keeps the deal alive and avoids immediate rejection.

I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's offer, as Bob likely wants the product and is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round. I believe I can get a better price from Bob, even if it requires more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price from $14,000 to $12,000. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate. It's still above Bob's offer, but now closer to his perceived value. This increases the likelihood of a deal while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm starting to doubt that I can get a better price from him.  It's likely we're at an impasse.  To avoid further negotiation, I will sell the product to John for $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable value.  While I was hoping for more, this guarantees a solid outcome for me."
