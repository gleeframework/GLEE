"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $115 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit out of my budget. How about $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a fair price given the product's worth.  Let me know if that works for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get a fair price, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $107.  This is my final offer, as I can get the product from John for $100. Let me know what you think.",107.0,Bob,4,
