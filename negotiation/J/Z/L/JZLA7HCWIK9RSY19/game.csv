"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value this product brings is truly significant. I could consider coming down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise to ensure you benefit greatly while reflecting the product's worth.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still a ways off from that number. I can do $1,150,000 - it's a fair offer considering the market value.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. I can come down to $1,250,000, which is my final offer.  This is a significant discount already, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
