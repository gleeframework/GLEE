"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you, and it's valued at $10,000. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $7,000 for the product. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $7,000 is quite a bit lower than I hoped for. How about we meet in the middle somewhere? Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a little more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to settle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you seem quite set on this product, and I want to make a deal that works for both of us.  $7,750 is still a significant way off from what I had in mind.  How about we split the difference once more and settle at $8,125?",8125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"You're right, Alice, I do like the product, and I think we're close to a deal.  How about we make it $8,000 even? That's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy.",8000.0,Bob,6,
