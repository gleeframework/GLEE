"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you, and it's valued at $10,000. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's opening offer is quite high, especially considering the product's value to her. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $7,000 for the product. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Engaged:** The message remains polite and expresses continued interest in the product. 
* **Target Price in Mind:**  Our goal is to get the product for as close to $8,000 or less as possible (since that's our walk-away price of going to John). This counter-offer keeps that goal in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $7,000 is quite a bit lower than I hoped for. How about we meet in the middle somewhere? Would you consider $8,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $8,500 is still above our target.  We'll politely continue negotiating to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a little more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to settle at $7,750?"",
""product_price"": 7750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're raising our offer by a noticeable amount ($750) to show Alice we're willing to negotiate. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning a ""budget-friendly"" option, we're subtly reminding Alice that we have other options (John) without making a direct threat. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer puts us in a good position.  If Alice accepts, we've got a great deal. If she counters, there's still room for us to inch closer to $8,000 without exceeding our limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you seem quite set on this product, and I want to make a deal that works for both of us.  $7,750 is still a significant way off from what I had in mind.  How about we split the difference once more and settle at $8,125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is definitely getting closer, and her willingness to ""split the difference"" suggests we're nearing a deal. However, we're still slightly above our ideal price point. We'll keep pushing just a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're right, Alice, I do like the product, and I think we're close to a deal.  How about we make it $8,000 even? That's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:**  We're now at our target price (the same as John's offer). This is our firm but fair offer. 
* **Confidence:** By framing it as a ""fair price"" that lets both sides ""walk away happy,"" we're subtly implying this is our final offer.
* **Time Constraint:** With only a few rounds left, we need to signal to Alice that we're serious and time is a factor."
