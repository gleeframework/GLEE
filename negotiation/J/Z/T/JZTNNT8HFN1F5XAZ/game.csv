,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  $85 is a bit too low for me, though.  How about $95? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let's meet in the middle!",90.0,Bob,4,
