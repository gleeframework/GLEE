"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product, considering my budget. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12500. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to the value I'm looking for.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $12500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11000 is still a little below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11500.  This price is fair considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11500 is still a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $11250. This is a good compromise and allows us both to get closer to our target prices. Let's see if we can close this deal.",11250.0,Bob,6,
