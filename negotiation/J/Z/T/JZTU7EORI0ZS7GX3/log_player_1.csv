Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product, considering my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is my floor price, I think I can get closer to my desired amount with some negotiation.  I'm going to see if I can push Bob a bit higher."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to the value I'm looking for.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $12500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $11,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a bit more.  I'll see if I can get Bob to budge a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is still a little below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500.  This price is fair considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11500 is still a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $11250. This is a good compromise and allows us both to get closer to our target prices. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like to get closer to $11,500,  $11,250 is a fair price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn.  This is a good outcome for both of us."
