Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $115 is above your minimum of $100, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's within Bob's range:**  $115 is lower than Bob's perceived value of $120, making it potentially appealing to him. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, you can still negotiate downwards, and if he accepts, you've secured a good price. 

It's important to keep in mind the potential of selling to John for $100 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's important to remember:

* **You're in a strong position:** You know John is willing to pay $100. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** You can still try to get a better price from Bob.
* **Rejecting the offer doesn't mean you lose:** You can counteroffer and potentially get a better deal, or sell to John if negotiations with Bob fail.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain your leverage and continue exploring options to maximize your profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. While I appreciate your offer, $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $105? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** The counteroffer of $105 is a middle ground between your initial offer of $115 and Bob's offer of $100. This shows you're willing to negotiate but not at the expense of a reasonable profit.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message reiterates the product's value for Bob and emphasizes that $105 is still a good deal for him.
* **Maintain Flexibility:**  By not accepting Bob's offer outright, you retain the option to sell to John if necessary, which strengthens your position in the negotiation."
