"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $1500000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it.  This reflects a fair value considering my maximum spending limit and allows for potential profit for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering your budget.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $800000. This is a fair price, considering my budget constraints and allows for a decent profit for you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer it to you for $950000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I get a decent return on my investment.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your latest offer is getting closer, but I still need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to finding a deal. Let's make this happen.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $975000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I need to ensure I get a decent return on my investment.",975000.0,Alice,7,
