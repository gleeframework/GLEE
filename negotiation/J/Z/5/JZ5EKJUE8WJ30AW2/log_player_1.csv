Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $12,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is likely to counter-offer, giving you the opportunity to negotiate.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  The price is significantly lower than the product's value to him, making it a good deal.

By setting this initial price, you're demonstrating your willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profit that's close to the product's potential value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am only willing to pay up to $12000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price.  While you'd prefer to get more, accepting his offer ensures a sale and prevents the risk of further negotiation potentially resulting in a lower price or a complete deal breakdown."
