"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good price for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is generous, the value of this product is truly significant, and $850,000 falls short of what I can accept. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's on the table."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us, and it allows us to close the deal without further delays. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer, but we're still under John's offer.  It's worth one more counteroffer to try and get closer to that $1,000,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to accept $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end."", 
""product_price"": 1050000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm going to offer my final price of $950,000.  This is a significant move for me, and I believe it's a fair price for a product that's valuable to both of us. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has indicated this is his final offer, and it's still below John's standing offer.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely Bob will meet the $1,000,000 mark. It's more profitable to take John's guaranteed offer at this point."
