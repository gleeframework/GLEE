Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price, aiming for the best possible deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $1,400,000 is a significant amount, but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate and potentially get a better deal than he would from John.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, so there's potential for him to accept a price slightly below that. 

**Strategy:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've secured a very good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer, keeping in mind John's offer of $1,000,000 as my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, and there's still room for us to find a price that works for both of us. 

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer closer to my initial asking price, aiming for something between $1,300,000 and $1,350,000. This keeps the negotiation going while still protecting my interests. 
* **Monitoring John's Offer:** I'll keep John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind as a safety net. If the negotiations with Bob don't yield a better price, I can always choose to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** This counteroffer represents a compromise between my initial price of $1,400,000 and Bob's offer of $1,200,000.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This price is well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, ensuring that I'm not losing out on a significant profit.
* **Attractive to Bob:**  $1,350,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's below the product's value to him ($1,500,000). This increases the likelihood of him accepting.

**Strategy:**

* **Finding a Win-Win:**  I'm aiming for a price that both Bob and I find acceptable, allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Staying Flexible:**  I'm ready to negotiate further if needed, but I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly lower than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is lower than I initially hoped for, it's still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  We've been through several rounds of negotiation, and it's likely that continuing to haggle will only prolong the process and increase the chance of Bob walking away.
* **Secure Profit:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a profit of $250,000, which is a substantial amount. 

**Strategy:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The risk of rejecting Bob's offer and potentially having to accept John's lower offer is too high.  
* **Finality:** This offer allows me to finalize the sale and move on to other opportunities.  While it might not be the absolute best price, it's a good outcome considering the circumstances."
