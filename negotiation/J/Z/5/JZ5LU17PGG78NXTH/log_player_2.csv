Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than you're comfortable with, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.

Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've given you a lot of concessions, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.

Alice is clearly holding firm, and while there are still rounds left, the potential savings by pushing further are diminishing.  $1,120,000 is a reasonable compromise, and it's better to secure the deal now than risk Alice walking away."
