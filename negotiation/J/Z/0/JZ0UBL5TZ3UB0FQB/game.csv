"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's try to meet in the middle from my original offer. How about we settle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above your target, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $1,250,000? It's a fair price, considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet at $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $1,225,000? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",1225000.0,Alice,7,
