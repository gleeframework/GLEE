Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet at $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $1,225,000? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $1,225,000.  You have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,200,000. It makes more sense to take the sure thing and buy from John, saving you $25,000."
