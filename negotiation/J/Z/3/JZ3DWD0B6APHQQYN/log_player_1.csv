Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $115. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By initially offering the product at a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120), I am aiming to secure a favorable deal while leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Negotiation Space:** I don't want to start too high and scare Bob away.  A slightly lower price than his perceived value gives him an incentive to negotiate.
* **Backup Plan:** I am aware I have a backup offer from John for $100. This knowledge allows me to negotiate from a position of strength."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment.  How about $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $105 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm looking for a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation because I am confident I can get a better offer from Bob than my fallback option with John ($100)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic aims to find a compromise that seems fair to both parties. 
* **Maintaining a Margin:**  I am still aiming for a price above my minimum ($100) to maximize my profit.
* **Encouraging Agreement:** By framing the price as a fair compromise, I hope to nudge Bob towards accepting and closing the deal."
