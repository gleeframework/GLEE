Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8000 at this time. Let me know what you think.

The product is worth at least $12,000 to me, and Bob's offer is significantly lower. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to sell the product for $15,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a great opportunity for you to own this incredible product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $15000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's my absolute limit. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll need to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell the product for $12,500.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $12500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer and go up to $11250.  This is my final offer, and I'm ready to move forward if you're willing to accept.
