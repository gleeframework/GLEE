"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $18000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure it'll be worth more than that to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $8,000.  He should try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to sell the product for $15000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a great opportunity for you to own this incredible product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a lower price than the initial $18,000, it's still above his budget. He should continue to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $15,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute limit. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell the product for $12500.  This price reflects the value of the product while also being within your budget. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than previous offers, $12,500 is still over his budget.  He should continue to try and negotiate a lower price, or potentially consider buying from John if he's worried he'll lose the opportunity."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $12,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer and go up to $11,250.  This is my final offer, and I'm ready to move forward if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're pushing your budget, but $11250 is still a bit short of where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $11750 as a final compromise. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this incredible product. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While Alice has lowered the price, it's still above Bob's comfortable budget. 
* **Limited rounds:** This is round 7, leaving only three rounds left.  It's likely that Alice will continue to hold out for a price closer to her desired amount.
* **Guaranteed price:**  John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000, which is within Bob's budget and a much better deal than what Alice is currently offering.

It's important to consider that Bob has a finite number of rounds to make a deal. While he can continue to negotiate, the risk of getting stuck in a prolonged negotiation with Alice, without a guaranteed outcome, is high.  Buying from John gives him a guaranteed deal within his budget."
