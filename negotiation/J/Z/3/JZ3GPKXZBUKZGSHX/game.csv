"Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $18000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure it'll be worth more than that to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to sell the product for $15000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a great opportunity for you to own this incredible product. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $15000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's my absolute limit. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll need to consider other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to sell the product for $12500.  This price reflects the value of the product while also being within your budget. Let me know if this works for you.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $12500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer and go up to $11250.  This is my final offer, and I'm ready to move forward if you're willing to accept.",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pushing your budget, but $11250 is still a bit short of where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $11750 as a final compromise. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this incredible product. Let's make this deal happen.",11750.0,Alice,7,
