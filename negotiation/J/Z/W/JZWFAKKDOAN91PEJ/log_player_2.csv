"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $140 is higher than your maximum budget of $150. You have room to negotiate a better price. By rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer, you can try to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still above her valuation leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize potential savings while acknowledging interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $110 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $125?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $125, which is a reasonable price and within your budget. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and waiting might risk losing the deal. It's better to secure the product at a good price now."
