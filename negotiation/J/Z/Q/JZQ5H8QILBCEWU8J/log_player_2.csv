"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about negotiating. It's also a bit higher than Alice's perceived value, leaving room for compromise.
* **Fairness:** The offer is still within the range of what the product is worth to you. 
* **Openness:**  The message emphasizes your willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price.  While I appreciate your interest, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and a $9,000 price point is within your budget and a good savings compared to John's offer.
* **Compromise:**  Accepting this offer represents a successful compromise, and it's reasonable to assume further negotiation might not yield much more savings.
* **Time:** Continuing to negotiate risks running out of time and being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
