"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I'm proposing a special introductory price of $125 for you. This is an exclusive offer tailored just for you, considering your appreciation for high-quality items. I'm confident it will meet your expectations and provide substantial value. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $150 for the product.
* Alice's offer is $125, which is less than your maximum, but still higher than what the product is worth to her ($100).
* You can get the product from John for $150, which is your maximum price.
* It makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John for a lower price, saving yourself $25."
