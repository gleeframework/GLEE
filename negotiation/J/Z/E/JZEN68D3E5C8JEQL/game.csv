"Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  To start, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This reflects the product's value and the potential we see in our partnership.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $800,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,050,000.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair offer that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to a point where I can make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $925,000 is getting closer, I'm still not at a point where I can accept.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap. I'm prepared to go down to $975,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the product's value and our shared interest in seeing this deal succeed.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting very close.  I'm willing to move a bit more to show I'm serious.  Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,6,
