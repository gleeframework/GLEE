Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $15,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While I appreciate your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than $10,000. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $13,500?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and making a counteroffer. I understand the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.

You have three options:

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my $12,000 minimum. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
