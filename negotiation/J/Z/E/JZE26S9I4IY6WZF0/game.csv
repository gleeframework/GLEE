"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not comfortable going all the way down to $8,600. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,700. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for both of us. What do you think?",8700.0,Alice,5,
