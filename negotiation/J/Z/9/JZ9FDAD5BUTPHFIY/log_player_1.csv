{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140, which is a good starting point to maximize my profits while still being competitive.  I'm leaving some room for negotiation, knowing that Bob values the product at $150. I'm also framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, which could make him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $130 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $140 by counteroffering.  I'll aim for a middle ground in my next offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $135?  It's a fair price that still gives you a good value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 135}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to propose $130 for the product. This would allow me to stay within my budget while still getting a good value. Thank you for considering my request. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $130. While it's not my ideal price, it's still better than selling to John for $100. There's a risk that Bob might reject my next counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  $130 is a good compromise, allowing me to close the deal and get a decent profit."
