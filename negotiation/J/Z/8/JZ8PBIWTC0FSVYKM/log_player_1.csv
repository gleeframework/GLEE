Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a great price. I'm asking $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000 is a good starting point.** It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation.
* **The message is friendly and encouraging.**  It highlights the value of the product for Bob without revealing too much about your own valuation.

**Why this strategy:**

* **Maximize profit:**  You're aiming for a price closer to your minimum value while still leaving space for negotiation. 
* **Avoid immediate rejection:**  Bob might be willing to negotiate from $10,000, especially if he sees the value in the product.
* **Safety net:** If Bob rejects, you have John as a backup buyer, ensuring you get your minimum desired price."
