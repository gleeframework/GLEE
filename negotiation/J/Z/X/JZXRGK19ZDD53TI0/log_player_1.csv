Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not selling yourself short, and you have room to negotiate down if needed.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob incentive to accept, as he'll be getting a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can lower the price slightly, or even accept a counteroffer if it's reasonable.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while ensuring a smooth negotiation. Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than your minimum desired price. It's better to reject his offer and see if you can negotiate a higher price. You can still get a good deal while leaving room for a reasonable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $9,000? It's a fair price that still gives you a great deal on this product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher on the price. How about $8,200? I'm trying to get the best deal possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, but it's still not quite there.  You've already had a few rounds of negotiation and it's starting to feel like Bob isn't willing to meet you in the middle.  It's better to cut your losses and sell to John for $8,000 than to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with a lower price or a drawn-out process."
