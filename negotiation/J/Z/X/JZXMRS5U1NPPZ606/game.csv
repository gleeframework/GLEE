"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget constraints. I would like to propose a price of $110. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while keeping my expenses within my desired limit.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me.  $110 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about $115? This allows me to make a bit of profit while still being a good deal for you.",115.0,Alice,5,
