"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter-offer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  $1,250,000 is the highest I can go at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  This counteroffer starts with a significant reduction from Alice's price, aiming to establish a strong negotiating position.
* **Reasonable Compromise:**  $1,250,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget, but it leaves room for some negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains positive and open to finding a compromise, avoiding an adversarial tone."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, but that's my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above target:**  $1,350,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation room:**  There's still room for further negotiation, as Alice has already lowered her price. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** By rejecting, Bob can potentially get closer to his desired price or even secure a deal with John for a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit away from your offer.  I can go to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal here."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Move:**  This counteroffer is a smaller step than the previous one, demonstrating that Bob is serious about a deal but still trying to get the best price.

* **Closing the Deal:**  The message expresses confidence in closing the deal, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Alice to accept."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from your price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000. This would be a good deal for both of us and allow us to close this transaction. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above budget:**  While Alice has lowered her price, $1,325,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for better deal:**  There's still a chance that Bob can get closer to his desired price or even secure a deal with John for a better price.
* **Risk of accepting:**  If Bob accepts, he will exceed his budget. The risk of continuing the negotiation outweighs the benefit of accepting at this point."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While I'm getting closer to your price,  $1,300,000 is still the most I can offer at this point.  It's a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
