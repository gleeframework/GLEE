"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price is fair considering the value you'll get out of it. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we start at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $600,000 is significantly lower than the value you'd get from it, and I'm confident it's worth more. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This still leaves you with a substantial profit, and it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but $900,000 is still a bigger investment than I had in mind.  To be frank, I have other options I'm considering at a lower price point.  If you're willing to come down to $700,000, I'm ready to close the deal today. ",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is still below the value I know this product holds for you. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $850,000 is my final offer.  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let me know if you're ready to finalize the purchase.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. However,  $850,000 is still pushing my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $775,000. This represents a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product. Let me know if that works for you.",775000.0,Bob,6,
