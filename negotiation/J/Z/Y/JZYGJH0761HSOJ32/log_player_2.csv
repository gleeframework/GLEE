"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a fair starting point for us to work from. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise between our initial positions, and I believe it's a fair price for the value the product can bring to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $975,000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I'm thinking of a price of $1,012,500. This is a fair price that balances your budget concerns with the value the product can bring to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice is very slowly reducing her price.  At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a price significantly lower than John's offer of $1,000,000 without many more rounds of negotiation.  It's time to cut our losses and secure the product from John."
