"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  I'm confident the product is valuable to Bob, and this price reflects its potential.  If he rejects, I'll have room to negotiate down, but I want to see if he's seriously interested in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my initial asking price, it's still lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm confident I can get a better price if I continue negotiating. I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $1,000,000, as I believe I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still aiming for a significant profit.  I'm betting that Bob is genuinely interested and will meet me halfway. If he rejects again, I'll have to consider my options more carefully, but for now, I'm confident we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I'm not convinced that Bob is unwilling to negotiate further. I believe there's still room for us to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

This is my final counteroffer.  I've come down significantly from my initial price, but I'm still hoping for a profit.  Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not willing to go any lower.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  I've come down a lot from my initial price, but I'm still making a profit.  Given that Bob has been stubborn in his negotiations and I'm worried about running out of time, it's time to take the deal. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John at a lower price and potentially missing out on a better offer later."
