"Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'd like to get closer to the market value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,500,000 represents its full value, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its unique nature.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit far off from what I'm comfortable paying. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the maximum I can go.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. Let's make this our final offer: $1,225,000. This represents a significant price reduction on my end and I believe it's more than fair.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the reduction, but I still think $1,225,000 is too high. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. I'm going to reiterate my previous counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
