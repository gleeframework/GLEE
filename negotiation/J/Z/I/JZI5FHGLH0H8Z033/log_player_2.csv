"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than $12,000, he can likely get a better deal by negotiating. There's a good chance Alice is willing to lower her price to secure a sale, especially since she values the product at $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a price close to his maximum budget. He offers $8,500, leaving some room for negotiation while still being significantly lower than Alice's offer. This aggressive counteroffer shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal and might encourage her to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $9,000, which is within Bob's budget and a significant improvement from the initial $10,000 offer. Accepting this offer saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John. While there's always a possibility of getting an even lower price with further negotiation, the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential savings."
