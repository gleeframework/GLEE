"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $650,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a significant gap for me.  To be honest, my budget is closer to $700,000.  Would you be willing to meet me somewhere around there?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $700,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be closer to my minimum. Let's try $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're at an impasse.  Your last counteroffer didn't show much movement.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000, but that's my final offer.  I need to see some significant movement on your end to continue this negotiation.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're feeling like we're at an impasse, but I'm still not willing to meet your price of $750,000. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to be at $1,200,000 or higher to make this deal worthwhile. Let's try $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
