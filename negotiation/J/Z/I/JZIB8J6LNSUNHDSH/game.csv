"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given the market and my current budget, I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product. This reflects my genuine interest and the value I see in your offering. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer. While $900000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below what I believe the product is truly worth. To bridge the gap and demonstrate my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to lower my price to $1000000. This takes into account the market value and your current budget, while ensuring a fair return for me. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and $1000000 is getting closer to where I'd like to be. However, to finalize a deal, I need to be at $950000. This reflects my budget constraints and the market value I've researched. I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, allowing for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",950000.0,Bob,4,
