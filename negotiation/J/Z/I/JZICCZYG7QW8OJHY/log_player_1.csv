Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start with a higher price in negotiations. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Anchoring:** By offering a price of $120, you are ""anchoring"" Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher point. Even if he doesn't accept this price, it makes a lower price (but still above your minimum) seem more reasonable.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $80 with John, so there's little risk in aiming high with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly downward during negotiations if necessary.  However, don't go below your $80 minimum."
