"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $135?",135.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $135 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my ideal price.  How about $140?  That's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $140, which would be $130. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
