"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is too low and doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than $12,500. I'm willing to go up to $12,200. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value and the market conditions.",12200.0,Bob,4,
