"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,050,000 for the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
