Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob without explicitly stating his perceived value. 

This offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest while keeping my options open to sell to John if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $175 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $120.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would result in a loss for me. While I could sell to John for $150, I'm still willing to negotiate with Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $140? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but offering a counter-proposal. This shows willingness to negotiate but also maintains my position of not accepting a price below my minimum.
* **Justification:** I'm justifying my counter-offer with a value proposition (""great deal for you"").
* **Confidence:** I'm expressing confidence in the product's value, subtly reinforcing my stance.

This counter-offer positions me closer to my goal while leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $130. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm willing to negotiate, his offer is getting closer to my minimum.  However, I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $150.  To maximize my profit, I will sell the product to John."
