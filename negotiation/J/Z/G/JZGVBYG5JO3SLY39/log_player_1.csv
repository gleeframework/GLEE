Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $9,800? It's a compromise that I'm willing to make to get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. Let's settle at $10,200 and call it a deal. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 10200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're firm on the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable going above $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so how about we try $10,050? It's my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is clearly an error ($1,050 instead of $10,050) and continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better outcome than John's offer.  It's time to cut losses and secure the sale with John."
