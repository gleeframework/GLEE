"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial deal.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that still gives you a good profit, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can work something out.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away with a win. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is a fair compromise and a great deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $1,300,000 is closer, but still not quite there. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,325,000. This is a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will satisfy your needs.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,275,000, which is a significant step closer to my budget.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1275000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget. $1,275,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering $1,300,000. This is a final compromise from my end, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
