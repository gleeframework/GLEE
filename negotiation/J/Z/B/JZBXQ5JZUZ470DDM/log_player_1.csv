"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,700,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see how far he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,600,000. This is still above my minimum value, but it's closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.  I'm not willing to sell at a loss.  I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,550,000. This is a significant concession, but it's still above my minimum value. I'm hoping that Bob will see that I'm serious about making a deal, and he'll meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $1,475,000 is getting closer, I'm running out of time. I'm concerned that we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.  To avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely, I'll sell to John for $1,500,000. This guarantees me my minimum value and ensures a successful sale."
