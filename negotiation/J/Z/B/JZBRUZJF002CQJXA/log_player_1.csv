"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am interested in purchasing the product, but my budget is limited. Could we possibly agree on a price closer to $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $80, and I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $75 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $82.50? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 82.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget, could we agree on a price of $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $80 is exactly what I'm willing to accept, so I'll take it.  It's a fair price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
