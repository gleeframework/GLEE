Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $119. I believe it will be highly valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($120) without going over. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below his maximum leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $100 provides a safety net, ensuring Alice doesn't need to go below that price."
