"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1350000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1350000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a new offer of $1250000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1250000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering a final counteroffer of $1300000. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm afraid $1300000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at a price I'm comfortable with. My final offer is $1200000. I'm hoping you'll consider this price, but I'm also prepared to buy from John if we can't agree.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
