"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about $950,000?  That's a significant discount from my initial price and gives us both some room to compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above your target. How about we meet at $920,000? That's a fair price for both of us.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $920,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $935,000. It's a good deal for both of us and gets us closer to an agreement.",935000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm running out of time and need to make a decision soon.  $915,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $925,000 as a final offer.  Let's close this deal.",925000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your urgency, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'll meet you halfway between $915,000 and $925,000, so how about $920,000?",920000.0,Bob,8,
