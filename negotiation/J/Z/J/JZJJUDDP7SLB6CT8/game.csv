"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. While $8,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to move a bit closer to your range. How about we meet halfway and settle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Could you consider something closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but the value of this product is truly significant.  I could come down to $10,500, which is a very competitive offer considering its worth. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm getting closer to my limit. Could you do $9,500? That would seal the deal for me.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, you're getting very close to my absolute bottom line. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000, but that's my final offer.  This is a fantastic deal on a product you won't regret owning.",10000.0,Alice,7,
