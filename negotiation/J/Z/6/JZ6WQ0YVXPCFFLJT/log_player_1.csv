"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob.  This is a negotiating tactic to see if I can get closer to my minimum value. I am confident I can get a better offer than John's $12,000, but I want to see how much Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, so I'm rejecting it. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $11,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up in his next offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is $10,500, which is only $500 less than my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm accepting this offer to avoid risking further negotiation and the chance of Bob walking away.  While I would prefer to get closer to my minimum value, I'm confident I can get a better price from another buyer in the future."
