"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $8,000. I believe you'll find it's a great investment.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $6,000. Would you consider a price in that range?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit out of your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering its value to you is $8,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. I'm definitely interested, but $9,000 is still a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a fair price considering its value and my budget constraints.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit out of your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,500. This is still a good deal for me, considering its value to you is $8,000.",8500.0,Alice,5,
