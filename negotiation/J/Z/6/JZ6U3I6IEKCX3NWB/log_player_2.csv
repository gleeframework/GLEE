"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $8,000. I believe you'll find it's a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is way above your maximum price. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $6,000. Would you consider a price in that range?"",
 ""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While I'm willing to pay up to $8,000, I want to start the negotiation significantly lower to leave room for bargaining. 
* **Anchoring:** Offering $6,000 first sets a lower anchor point for the negotiation. This might make Alice more receptive to a compromise closer to my target price.
* **Polite but Firm:** I want to convey that I'm serious about buying but also firm about my budget limitations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit out of your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering its value to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, which is good, but $9,000 is still above my absolute limit and leaves little room for me to save.  I need to push back a bit further, but I also need to show I'm willing to move closer to her price. Let's see if I can get her closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. I'm definitely interested, but $9,000 is still a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a fair price considering its value and my budget constraints."",
 ""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting $7,500, I'm showing Alice I'm willing to compromise and move closer to her price.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating both the product's value to me and my budget constraints to reinforce why this price is reasonable. 
* **Urgency (Slight):**  While I haven't explicitly threatened to walk away, mentioning that $9,000 is ""still a stretch"" hints that I have other options (John)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit out of your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,500. This is still a good deal for me, considering its value to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice has come down significantly and is now only $500 above my alternative option (John). It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and I risk jeopardizing the deal. Accepting at $8,500 secures the product at a reasonable price, even if it's not the absolute lowest I could have gotten."
