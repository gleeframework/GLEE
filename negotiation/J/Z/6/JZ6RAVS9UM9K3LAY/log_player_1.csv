Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $18,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to earn as much as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $18,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere above my minimum. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  A higher initial offer helps me understand how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay. 

This strategy balances risk and reward. While Bob might reject a high offer, the potential for a significantly higher profit justifies the attempt."
