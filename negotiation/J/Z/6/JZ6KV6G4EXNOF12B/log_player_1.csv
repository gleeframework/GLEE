Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to go lower than my minimum of $1,500,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by:

* **Being reasonable:** $1,200,000 is a compromise between your minimum and Bob's perceived value.
* **Highlighting benefits:** Emphasizing the value for both parties makes the offer more appealing.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Leaving space to negotiate makes it more likely Bob will consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $1050000 for the product. It's still a good deal for you considering your minimum price, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price ($1,500,000).**  It is not a good deal for me.
* **I still have the option of selling to John for a much higher price.** This gives me leverage in the negotiation.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer, but $1,050,000 is simply too low. While I understand your budget constraints, I am committed to getting at least $1,200,000 for this product. To demonstrate my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to reduce the price to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1150000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1100000. This would be a fair compromise, allowing you to make a decent profit while staying within my price range. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price.** While it's still lower than my ideal, it's within a reasonable range for negotiation.
* **I risk losing the deal to John by continuing to negotiate.**  His offer represents a good compromise.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a reasonable profit, avoiding the risk of losing the deal to John."
