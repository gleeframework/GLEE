"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $1000000 to you, and I'm willing to go lower than my minimum of $1500000. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $1050000 for the product. It's still a good deal for you considering your minimum price, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer, but $1050000 is simply too low. While I understand your budget constraints, I am committed to getting at least $1200000 for this product. To demonstrate my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to reduce the price to $1150000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1150000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1100000. This would be a fair compromise, allowing you to make a decent profit while staying within my price range. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
