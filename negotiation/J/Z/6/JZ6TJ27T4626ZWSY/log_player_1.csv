Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $150 gives me some room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $150 is higher than my minimum, but still leaves space for Bob to make a counteroffer without me feeling like I'm losing too much.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and inviting to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget allows me to spend no more than $120. Would you consider accepting this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  
* **No Room for Improvement:**  There's no chance of getting a better price from Bob, as he's already stated his budget limit. 
* **Time and Effort:** Accepting avoids further negotiation rounds, saving time and effort.
* **Equal Value:** While I could try to push for a higher price, it's unlikely to succeed with Bob's firm stance."
