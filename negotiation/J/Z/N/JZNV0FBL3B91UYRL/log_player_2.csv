"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $90.  This is a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see why:

* **Alice's Offer:** $90
* **Your Maximum:** $100
* **John's Price:** $100

While Alice's offer is within your budget, you know John will sell it to you for $100. There's a chance you could get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she'll come down."
