Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a friendly and positive tone can encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:** The initial offer leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without me immediately resorting to selling to John.

This strategy balances the goal of maximizing profit with the need to keep Bob engaged and potentially secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I can only pay up to $10000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's tempting to take $10,000, it would be a huge loss. 

Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer, potentially bridge the gap, or ultimately walk away and sell to John for a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $11,500?  This is a fair compromise, and it still allows you to get a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while presenting a counteroffer that's closer to his price but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing this as a fair compromise to encourage Bob to see it as a good deal.
* **Keeping Options Open:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation open, giving me more flexibility in case Bob rejects it."
