Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product which I believe would be highly beneficial to you.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $13,500. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $15,000. Aiming for a price slightly below this ($13,500) increases the likelihood of a sale while securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  While John offers a safety net at $8,000, securing a deal with Bob at a higher price is much more desirable.
* **Negotiation Room:** The offered price leaves a small margin for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle."
