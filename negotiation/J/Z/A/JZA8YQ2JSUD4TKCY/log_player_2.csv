Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, I have another buyer who's offering $80.  I'd prefer to work out a deal with you, but I'm only willing to go as low as $82. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning:

* **Time pressure:** Alice is implying she has another buyer, creating a sense of urgency.  
* **Good deal:**  While not the absolute lowest, $82 is significantly less than John's $100 price and a reasonable compromise. 
* **Risk of losing out:**  Pushing further might make Alice go with the other buyer, leaving you to pay more with John."
