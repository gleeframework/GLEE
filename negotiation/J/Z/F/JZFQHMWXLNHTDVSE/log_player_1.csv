"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth so much to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my desired price.  If he rejects, I'll lower the price a bit in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm going to try and push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $12,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some breathing room.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm lowering my price from the previous round, but not by too much. I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still want to get a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here. Let's meet in the middle at $11,750.  That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,750 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to go a little higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference this time? I'm willing to come down to $12,125.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 12125}
``` 

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm still pushing for a good deal.  I'm hoping that by offering a compromise, Bob will be more likely to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle at $11,900? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $11,900 is still a good deal and more than what I'd get from John.  I'm willing to close the deal here to avoid risking further negotiation and potentially getting a lower price."
