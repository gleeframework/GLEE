Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a great price.  How does $110 sound? Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $110 is more than your minimum price of $80, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $110 is significantly lower than the $150 value Bob places on the product, making it a good deal for him. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can potentially go higher if Bob counters, but have a fallback in John who will pay $80."
