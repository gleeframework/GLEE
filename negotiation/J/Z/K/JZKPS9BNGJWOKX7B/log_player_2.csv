"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $15,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can save $3,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer. It's likely Alice will accept a counteroffer closer to her value of $8,000. Buying from John for $15,000 is a less desirable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $9,500? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but still above her value of $8,000.  This gives her room to negotiate, but also shows Bob is serious about making a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a good price for you considering the value you place on the product. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $15,000.  While Bob could potentially negotiate a lower price, the risk of Alice walking away or the deal falling apart isn't worth the potential savings. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price."
