"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's not worth buying from Alice at $180.  You can get the product from John for $100, so you should reject Alice's offer and proceed to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
``` 

This is your best possible price, as you can get the product from John for $100. It's unlikely Alice will accept this right away, but it establishes your bottom line and starts the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is still too high. You can get the product from John for a lower price, so rejecting her offer and counter-offering again is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

You're still aiming for the lowest price, but this is a more reasonable counteroffer. You're showing Alice that you're serious about buying, but are not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is still too high. While $140 is getting closer to your ideal price, John is still a better option. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

You're getting closer to Alice's likely acceptance point, but still staying below your own maximum price from John.  It's a good compromise that shows you're serious but not desperate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While you can still get the product for $100 from John, Alice's offer is now within your acceptable range. With only 3 rounds left, it's likely you won't get a better deal from Alice.  You're saving $5 compared to John's price, making it worthwhile to accept this offer."
