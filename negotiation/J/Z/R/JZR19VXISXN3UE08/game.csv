"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe this product has great value, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your budget considerations, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I could meet you halfway at $16,000. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm proposing $13,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I want to find a price that works for us both, I can't go as low as $13,000. How about we split the difference again and settle on $14,500?  This is my final offer.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $14,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $13,750. Can you consider this revised offer?",13750.0,Bob,6,
