,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1200000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to negotiate. I'm prepared to lower the price to $1700000. This reflects the significant value the product offers, while acknowledging your budget constraints.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1700000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think a fair price for the product would be $1350000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1350000 is still a significant distance from my minimum.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I can't go below $1550000. This reflects the unique value and potential of this product, and I believe it's a fair price.  I'm open to discussing further, but if we can't reach an agreement, I'll need to consider other options.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1550000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1400000, which is the lowest I can go. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement, but I need to be careful with my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
