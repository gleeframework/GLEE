"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's, but I can potentially get a better deal.**  I know the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting the offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially save even more money.**"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within my budget and a good deal.**  I'm saving $1,500 compared to buying from John.
* **Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of losing the deal isn't worth it.**  There's a chance Alice might reject my counteroffer again, and I could end up paying more."
