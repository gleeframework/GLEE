"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its value to you, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both parties. To start, I propose a price of $950,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for my budget. How about we bring it down to $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're aiming to pay significantly less than our maximum budget. Starting with a lower offer gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer but remains firm in seeking a more favorable price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $700,000, we're aiming for a price closer to Alice's value ($800,000) while still leaving room for potential counteroffers."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. In light of your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $850,000. This still allows us to maintain a fair profit margin while considering your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference and settle on $775,000?"",
""product_price"": 775000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  By suggesting a price directly in the middle of our previous offer and Alice's counteroffer, we're demonstrating a willingness to compromise and move closer to a deal.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  While a compromise, the offer is still significantly below Alice's initial asking price, keeping the pressure on her to move closer to our desired range.
* **Time Consideration:** We're now four rounds in, so finding a middle ground becomes more crucial to avoid reaching a stalemate or running out of rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. Considering our previous discussions, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose a price of $825,000 for the product. This still reflects a fair valuation given its worth to you, while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I can tell we're both motivated to make a deal.  How about $800,000?  That's a fair offer, and it saves us both from any further negotiation."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Going for the Win:** We're now at round 6, and Alice has consistently moved her price down. Offering her exact value ($800,000) could be seen as a bold move, but it could also be the key to closing the deal quickly.
* **Avoiding Stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate in small increments could lead to a stalemate or force us to accept a price higher than we'd like as time runs out. 
* **Projecting Confidence:**  By offering a price we believe is fair and then holding firm, we signal confidence in our position and that we're close to our limit."
