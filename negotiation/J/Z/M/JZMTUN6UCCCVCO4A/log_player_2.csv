"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to you. My minimum acceptable price is $800,000, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair deal.  Given the potential value of this product to your business, I believe a price of $900,000 would be mutually beneficial.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  Even though Alice is willing to negotiate, her offer of $900,000 is still more than you are willing to pay. 
* **John's offer is your fallback:** You can get the product from John for $1,000,000, which is still within your budget. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Alice's offer, you create pressure for her to lower her price. You can then potentially negotiate a better deal with Alice or stick with John."
