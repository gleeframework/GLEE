"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have no information about Alice's minimum price, so there's a possibility you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation and allows for potential back-and-forth. I'm aiming to get as close to my maximum budget of $1,200,000 as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate as I have no information about her minimum price, and I can still potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my budget, but it's closer to my maximum price. I'm increasing my offer by $150,000 to show that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to stay under my budget. This should encourage Alice to consider lowering her price further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget, but it's getting closer. Since I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000, it's still worth trying to negotiate further to see if I can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making my final counteroffer at my maximum budget.  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I believe this offer is reasonable. If Alice rejects this, I'll purchase from John for $1,200,000."
