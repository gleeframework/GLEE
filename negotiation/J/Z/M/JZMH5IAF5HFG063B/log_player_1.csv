Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 16000}

I've reached a point where the negotiations are getting too close to my minimum, and I'm worried about running out of rounds.  It's time to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
