"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're beginning with a strong anchoring point significantly above our minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, subtly influencing Bob's perception.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  We want to avoid a low initial offer that could lead to protracted negotiations.  This price provides a benchmark for Bob's counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,300,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below our minimum acceptable price and our guaranteed offer from John. We have room to negotiate and will aim to steer the price closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer reflects. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we consider $1,750,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Apparent Concession):** By appearing to concede and meet Bob ""halfway,"" we create a sense of momentum and encourage him to reciprocate.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This counteroffer keeps the price well above both Bob's initial offer and our guaranteed sale price with John. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps us gauge Bob's flexibility and willingness to move closer to our desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my position, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,400,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he sees the value in the product. However, $1,400,000 is still below our guaranteed sale price with John. We're in a strong position to negotiate further and aim for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to work towards a deal.  While your offer is tempting, the value this product brings to the table is undeniably higher.  I'm confident we can find a number that works for both of us.  How about we settle at $1,600,000?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** We start by acknowledging Bob's efforts, fostering a collaborative atmosphere.
* **Justifying the Price:**  The message reinforces the product's high value without explicitly dismissing Bob's offer.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  We make another smaller concession, moving closer to Bob's offer but staying above our guaranteed sale price with John. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  By consistently aiming for a higher price, we subtly signal to Bob that time is a factor, potentially pushing him to agree sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. Given my financial constraints, I would like to counter with an offer of $1,550,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 now exceeds our guaranteed sale price with John. While we could try to negotiate for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk Bob could walk away. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
