"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the price.  However,  $1,100,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers you. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000. This reflects the true value of the product and ensures a win-win for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
