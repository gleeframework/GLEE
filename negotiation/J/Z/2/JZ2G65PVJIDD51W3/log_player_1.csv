Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a suitable offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning he has a potential profit margin of $200,000 if he buys at your minimum price.
* **The Goal:** Maximize your profit by getting as close to $1,200,000 as possible without pushing Bob to reject the offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. I know its value is significant to you, and I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning**

* **High but Reasonable:** This price is high, reflecting the product's value to Bob, but leaves him with a $50,000 incentive to buy from you instead of seeking alternatives.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, you've left some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value and the fairness of the offer, potentially making Bob more receptive.

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes Bob is rational and motivated by profit. If you have insights into his personality (e.g., he's highly competitive, risk-averse, etc.), you might adjust your approach.
* **Alternative Buyers:**  While John provides a safety net, knowing if there are other potential buyers (and their budgets) could influence your strategy."
