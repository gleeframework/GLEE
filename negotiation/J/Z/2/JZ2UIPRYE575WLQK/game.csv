"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Could you do $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price still allows me to achieve a reasonable profit while acknowledging the value you see in the product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,150,000 is closer, it's still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work. Let's compromise at $1,200,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go while still covering my costs.  I'm confident this product will bring you significant value, making this a worthwhile investment.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
