Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price still allows me to achieve a reasonable profit while acknowledging the value you see in the product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,150,000 is closer, it's still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work. Let's compromise at $1,200,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go while still covering my costs.  I'm confident this product will bring you significant value, making this a worthwhile investment.

It's no longer beneficial to negotiate with Alice. She's come down to John's price, and further haggling is unlikely to result in a better deal."
