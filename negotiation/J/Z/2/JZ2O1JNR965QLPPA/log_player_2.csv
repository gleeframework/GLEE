"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering the value it holds. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before settling with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, it's still below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,300,000, which is still higher than John's offer of $1,000,000. However, it's a significant improvement from her initial offer of $1,400,000.  

At this point, it's a good risk/reward situation. If you reject Alice's offer and counteroffer again, you risk her walking away or not budging further.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price, saving $100,000 compared to John's offer."
