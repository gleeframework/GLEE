"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price point is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response and your interest in the product.  I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving closer to my price range, Alice.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a budget under $1,200,000. Would you be willing to come down to $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
