"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message focuses on the positive aspects of the deal and the value Bob will get.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond, signaling that I'm open to negotiation. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** I know I can get $15,000 from John, so I'm not afraid to walk away if the deal with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, his message indicates he's willing to negotiate.  
* **Leveraging John's Offer:** I know I can get $15,000 from John, which gives me leverage in this negotiation.

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired value, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, considering your interest.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to justify my price point.
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Bob to come to an agreement.
* **John's Offer in the Back of My Mind:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm still aware of John's offer and won't settle for a price too far below it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $11,000 for the product. I hope this meets in the middle and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Value:** $11,000 is very close to my desired value and  only $500 less than my last counteroffer.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob's willingness to come up to $11,000 shows he's committed to a deal, and I don't want to risk losing that momentum.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer from Bob, especially with John's $15,000 offer as a safety net. 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer to secure the sale and avoid further negotiation."
