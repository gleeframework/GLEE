"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $100. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is willing to negotiate, she's unlikely to go below $120.  It's better to take the guaranteed deal from John at $100 and avoid further back-and-forth."
