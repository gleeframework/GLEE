Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob.  There are still 8 rounds left, so I have time to explore other options."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,800 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a higher price with Bob. It's still early in the game, and I have plenty of rounds left. I also have the option to sell to John for $10,000 if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,800 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,200. This is my final offer before I move on to other potential buyers.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9200}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,900 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm going to keep pushing for a higher price. I have 4 rounds left, and I still have the option to sell to John.  I'm not going to settle for a low price unless I have to."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $8,950 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to settle for anything less than $9,000. I have two rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price or sell to John if I need to."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I don't want to lose this deal. If you're truly interested, you need to accept this final offer."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,900 for the product. Can you consider my offer?

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round and Bob's offer of $8,900 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. It's better than nothing, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that's so low, especially since I have a guaranteed sale to John for a much better price.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to a more profitable deal."
