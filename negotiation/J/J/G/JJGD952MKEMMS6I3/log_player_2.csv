"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $110. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While $110 is less than the product's worth to Alice, it's still more than you want to pay. You know John will sell it for $80, so it makes sense to try and negotiate a better price with Alice first."
