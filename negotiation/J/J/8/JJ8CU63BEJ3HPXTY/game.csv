"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll accept $1,100,000. This still leaves you a significant profit margin, and it's a fair price for the value of this product. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you'll gain from this product. Let me know if you're willing to close the deal at this price.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
