"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $100 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position. While I value your interest, $100 is unfortunately too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm proposing $120 for the product. This still allows you a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let's see if we can find common ground.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I am still unable to meet at $120, but I am willing to go up to $110 for the product. I hope this revised offer is within your acceptable range.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your latest offer.  While I'm happy to see we're getting closer,  $110 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115.  This allows me to make a fair profit while still giving you a good deal on the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",115.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I am willing to pay $110 for the product, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. I hope this aligns with your expectations and we can finalize the transaction.",110.0,Bob,6,
