{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $130 leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Positive framing:** Emphasizing the value and deal for Bob might encourage him to accept. 
* **Open to negotiation:** By saying ""Let me know what you think"", I leave the door open for counteroffers and continued negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a sale at a profitable price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make a counter-counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $100 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.

You have three options:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your latest offer.  While I'm happy to see we're getting closer,  $110 is still a little too low for me.
