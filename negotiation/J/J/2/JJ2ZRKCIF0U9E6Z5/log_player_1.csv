Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000). This creates room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and encouraging, highlighting the value of the product and leaving the door open for discussion. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my potential earnings:** By starting higher, I have more room to negotiate down without reaching my minimum.
* **Encourage Bob to accept:** The price is within his range, and the positive message might make him more inclined to engage.
* **Keep the negotiation open:** By leaving the door open for discussion, I can adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe there's room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially reach a deal that benefits both of us. Selling to John guarantees $10,000, but I'm not willing to give up on getting a higher price from Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this deal happen. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm reducing my price from $9,500 to $9,000, showing a willingness to compromise while still staying above Bob's offer. 
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's position but maintain my stance on the price. I'm using language that invites further negotiation and emphasizes finding a compromise. 

**Reasoning:**

By offering $9,000, I'm:

* **Maintaining a good negotiating position:** It's a reasonable counteroffer that doesn't completely cave to Bob's demands.
* **Staying above my minimum:** I'm still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, leaving room for potential concessions without sacrificing too much. 
* **Encouraging further negotiation:** The message is friendly and inviting, suggesting I'm open to a final agreement that's mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think we can do better. Would you be willing to meet me at $8750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to settle for that amount. I believe I can potentially push for a higher price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer.  Selling to John guarantees $10,000, but I'm motivated to see if I can reach a better agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $8,900? This is my final offer, as it's getting close to my minimum acceptable price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm reducing my price to $8,900, which is only $150 away from Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a reasonable price.
* **Message:** I'm highlighting the fact that this is my final offer, adding a sense of urgency and potentially pushing Bob to accept. I'm also reiterating that this is getting close to my minimum acceptable price.

**Reasoning:**

By offering $8,900, I'm:

* **Closing the gap:** I'm significantly closer to Bob's offer, making it more appealing to him.
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm still slightly above Bob's offer, leaving room for potential negotiation if he wants to counter.
* **Setting a deadline:** My final offer message creates a sense of urgency, making Bob more likely to accept.

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a deal:** By offering a price that's close to Bob's desired amount, I'm increasing the likelihood of a successful negotiation.
* **Maximize my earnings:** While $8,900 is not my ideal price, it's still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Limit further negotiation:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm hoping to avoid further back-and-forth negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close, but I think I can get it even better. Would you be willing to meet me at $8800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is getting really close, and Bob's offer is tempting, but I've already conceded a lot. At this point, I'm worried that further negotiation with Bob might drag things out and still result in a price I'm not happy with. 

Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, which is a safe and sure bet. While I might be able to squeeze out a few hundred more from Bob, the risk of a drawn-out negotiation that ultimately results in a lower price is not worth it."
