"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $10000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value the product at significantly more than $10000, I'm willing to compromise. I'm confident that $12000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can make this work!",12000.0,Alice,3,
