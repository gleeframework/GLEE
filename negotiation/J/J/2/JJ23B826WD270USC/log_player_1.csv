Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant returns you'll gain.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start the negotiation significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offered price of $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate while still securing a substantial profit for you.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's high value without revealing your bottom line, encouraging Bob to seriously consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still giving Bob a chance to make a deal that's beneficial for him if he perceives the value to be higher than $1,300,000."
