Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $100. I believe it would be highly valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price higher than John's offer ($80) but lower than Bob's perceived value ($120) to maximize potential profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $100 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit if Bob accepts. 
* **First Refusal:** By offering the product to Bob first at a price closer to his perceived value, we increase the likelihood of a sale before resorting to John's guaranteed offer."
