"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:**  This first offer serves to gauge Bob's interest level and willingness to negotiate. His response will provide valuable information about how to proceed.
* **Alternative Option:**  Keep in mind that you have the option to walk away and sell to John for your minimum acceptable price. This knowledge gives you leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than both your asking price and your minimum acceptable price. Rejecting this offer signals that you're serious about a higher valuation and keeps the negotiation open for a potentially better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for both of us, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,800,000. This reflects the product's potential and offers you a fair price."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  Lowering the price by $200,000 shows a willingness to negotiate but avoids drastically dropping to Bob's level. 
* **Justification:**  Emphasizing the product's value and fairness helps justify the higher price point.
* **Maintaining Value:**  This counteroffer still keeps the price significantly above Bob's perceived value, aiming to find a middle ground closer to your desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product has value, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to make sure I'm not overpaying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, but it's time to cut your losses.  Here's why:

* **Limited Upside:** Even if you negotiate Bob up slightly, you're unlikely to gain more than $100,000-$200,000 over his current offer. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000. There's no risk of further negotiation or a failed deal.
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time and effort. Selling to John allows you to move forward and potentially use those resources for other opportunities. 

While you could potentially squeeze a bit more from Bob, the risk and potential gains aren't worth jeopardizing a guaranteed sale at your desired minimum."
