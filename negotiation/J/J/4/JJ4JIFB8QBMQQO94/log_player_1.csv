Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

This is a reasonable starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter and see if we can reach an agreement. However, I have John as a backup, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer than my initial price, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still above Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up a bit, as we seem to be getting closer to a deal. If he rejects, I'm prepared to make another counteroffer, but I'm getting closer to my ""walk away"" price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to continue to lower my price. John is offering my minimum, and it's time to secure a certain sale."
