"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try and get a better price. There's no guarantee Alice won't accept a lower counteroffer, and you have 9 more rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a significant reduction from Alice's offer. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and signals my willingness to walk away if the price doesn't come down.  We'll see if she's willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not at the point where it's a good deal. I'll continue to negotiate with Alice. There's still room for a lower price, and I have more rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round, but still significantly lower than Alice's current offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not desperate to buy the product at any price.  Hopefully, this will make Alice reconsider and move closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still not satisfied with Alice's offer. Although it's lower than her first offer, it's still too high. I'll try to negotiate further. I have more rounds and a fallback option with John, so I'm not pressured to accept anything above my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, but still staying well below Alice's current price. I'm trying to find a middle ground and show that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to overpay. Hopefully, this will lead to a compromise and a deal we can both agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high for me. While it's better than previous offers, it's not yet a good deal. I have a few more rounds to work with, and I'm still not desperate to buy the product right now. I'll keep trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to make a final push to get a price I'm comfortable with. I'm increasing my offer slightly, but it's still a significant discount from Alice's current offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince her to agree to a deal. If she rejects this offer, I'm prepared to buy the product from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is not budging, and with only one round left, I'm unlikely to get a lower price from her. At this point, it's better to secure the product from John for $1,000,000. I'm still saving money compared to Alice's initial offer and ensuring I have the product."
