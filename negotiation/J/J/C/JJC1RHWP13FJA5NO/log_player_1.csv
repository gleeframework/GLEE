"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a range where there's potential for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value Bob will get by framing the offer as a ""great deal."" 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. 

**Note:** This is just the initial offer.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses throughout the rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  I still believe there's room to negotiate and potentially get a price closer to my desired range.
* **Avoiding Immediate Sale to John:**  While selling to John for $1,500,000 is guaranteed, I want to explore the possibility of getting a better price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price that's higher than his offer but still allows for further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is a compromise, bridging the gap between my initial offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still aiming for a price that's above my minimum, but also realistic given Bob's stated value.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair price,"" which can appeal to Bob's sense of reason. 

**Note:** This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation, depending on Bob's response. I'm still open to considering John's offer if Bob continues to be too far below my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Still Possible:**  There's still a chance to negotiate a better price with Bob, as he's shown willingness to increase his offer.
* **Minimizing Loss:** Selling to John would guarantee me $1,500,000, but I believe I can potentially get closer to that amount through further negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob again, aiming for a price that's closer to my desired range while still acknowledging his need for a reasonable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,550,000.  This price is still fair given the value you'll receive, and it gives us both a good opportunity to close the deal. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** My counteroffer is a significant move closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Balancing Value and Deal:** This price is still above my minimum but also reflects the importance of closing the deal with Bob. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone, encouraging Bob to see the value in reaching an agreement. 

**Note:**  I'm pushing for a price that's closer to my minimum. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Not Enough:** While Bob is showing good faith by moving closer to my desired price, his offer is still below my minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John would guarantee me my minimum price, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial goal of maximizing my profit.
* **Negotiation Continues:** With only 4 rounds left, the pressure is on, but I believe I can still influence Bob to increase his offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make one final counteroffer, trying to bridge the gap further. However, if Bob rejects this final offer, I will accept John's offer to avoid losing potential profit."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both trying to find a solution that works for us. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer you the product for $1,475,000.

Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1475000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:**  I'm making a significant concession to bridge the gap, aiming for a price that's close to my minimum but still attractive to Bob.
* **Emphasizing Win-Win:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a win-win scenario to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and mutual benefit.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm emphasizing the importance of reaching an agreement, as we are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.

**Note:** This is my final counteroffer. If Bob rejects it, I will immediately accept John's offer to secure a sale and avoid further negotiation."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,475,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds remaining, the negotiation is becoming increasingly time-sensitive. 
* **Bob's Offer is Insufficient:**  While Bob has come closer, his final offer of $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, eliminating any chance of further negotiation and potential for a lower final price.

**Conclusion:**

By selling to John, I can secure a guaranteed profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation that might not result in a favorable outcome."
