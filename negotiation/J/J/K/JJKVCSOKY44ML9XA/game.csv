"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer you $1,100,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to accept $1,250,000 for the product. This price is fair to both of us and allows us to reach an agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
