Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the value, my assessment of the product's potential and long-term benefits leads me to a different figure.  I could consider letting it go for $1,900,000.  This is a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution.

While $1,900,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than my maximum budget. I can counteroffer again to see if we can find a middle ground."
