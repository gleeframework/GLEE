"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is a bit out of my range.  Given my research and the market value, I'd be willing to offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering our respective goals and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the value, my assessment of the product's potential and long-term benefits leads me to a different figure.  I could consider letting it go for $1,900,000.  This is a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate the compromise you've shown. However, $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  I believe this is a reasonable price that reflects the value we both see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
