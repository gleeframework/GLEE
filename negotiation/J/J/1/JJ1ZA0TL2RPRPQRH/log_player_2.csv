Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible but I can't let this go for less than $140.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down in price, her ""final offer"" of $140 is still more than your maximum budget. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $120, which aligns with your goal of saving money."
