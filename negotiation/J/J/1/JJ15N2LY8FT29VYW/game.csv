"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value, and I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $10,000 is significantly below its value.  I could consider letting it go for $17,000. This is a fair offer, considering the quality and potential of what I'm offering.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $17,000 is still a bit steep for my budget though.  How about $11,000? That's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While I value your interest, $11,000 is too low. I'd be willing to accept $15,000. This is my final offer, as it's the lowest I can go.",15000.0,Alice,5,
