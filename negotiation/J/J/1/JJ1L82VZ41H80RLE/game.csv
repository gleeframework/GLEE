"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant investment. I could go up to $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're willing to make a significant investment in this product, and I appreciate your interest. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $950,000. This is a more reasonable price considering the value I have in mind.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  How about we settle on $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",900000.0,Alice,7,
