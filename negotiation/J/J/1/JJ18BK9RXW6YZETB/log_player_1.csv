Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it. I'm asking for $14,000. Let me know your thoughts, and we can go from there."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land closer to your desired price. 
* **Justification:** While I haven't explicitly stated why the product is worth the asking price to Bob, the message implies there's value beyond the $10,000 he perceives. This could be due to scarcity, unique features, etc. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and invites a counter-offer. This keeps the communication open and avoids alienating Bob with an overly aggressive initial price. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, there's always a risk that Bob will reject the offer outright. Weighing this risk against potential reward is crucial in any negotiation."
