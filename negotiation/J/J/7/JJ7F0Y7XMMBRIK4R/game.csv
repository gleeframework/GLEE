"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1200000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was hoping we could discuss a lower price. Considering the product's value to you is $1500000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the value I'll get from the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. Considering the product's value to me is $1500000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1100000. This is still a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's value to you is $1500000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the value I'll get from the product.

"Thank you for your latest counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950000. Considering the product's value to me is $1500000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1050000. This is a compromise that still leaves me with a decent profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest counteroffer, Alice. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's value to you is $1500000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, and I believe this is the maximum I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1000000.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
