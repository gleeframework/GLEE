"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  While the product is worth $100 to you, it's worth $80 to Alice. This means there's room for negotiation. You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we split the difference and meet at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You can likely get it for closer to your initial counteroffer of $85.  Let's see if you can get her to budge a bit more."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $90 is still a little too high for me. I'm really looking to pay $85 for this, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 85}
