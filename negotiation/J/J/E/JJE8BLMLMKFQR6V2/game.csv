"I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. Given the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $12,500.  What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,500 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  Would you consider $13,000? This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you at this price. However, I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll give you a final offer of $13,250, but I'm not budging from that. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",13250.0,Alice,5,
