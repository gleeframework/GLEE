"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it allows room for negotiation and potential profit. I'll see how Bob reacts to this initial offer before making any further adjustments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is my minimum value, I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I will reject his offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $12,000, which is still a good profit for me.  I'm hoping this demonstrates a willingness to compromise and encourages Bob to meet me halfway."
