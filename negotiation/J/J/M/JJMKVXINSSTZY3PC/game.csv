"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a slightly lower price point.  Considering the product's value to you, I'd like to propose $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the potential of the product while still being within my budget. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Considering the product's significant value to you,  I'd be willing to accept $1,100,000.  This price allows me to make a fair profit while acknowledging your  business needs. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  While $1,100,000 is closer to my target,  I'm still looking for a more substantial price reduction.  I'm willing to offer $1,075,000.  This price represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's work together to bridge this small gap and reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,075,000 is still a bit below my target.  I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000.  This compromise demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal, while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's finalize this agreement and move forward together.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
