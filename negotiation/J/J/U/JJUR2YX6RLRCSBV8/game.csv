"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  Would you consider $1,175,000? This reflects my willingness to be flexible while still acknowledging the product's worth.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
