"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a unique item that's worth a significant amount to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a great product, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  To be completely transparent, I have a hard limit at $1,050,000. If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you have a hard limit, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'll offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope it's within your budget.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
