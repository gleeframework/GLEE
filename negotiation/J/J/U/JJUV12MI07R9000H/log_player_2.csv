"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he can still try to negotiate further, Alice's offer is within his budget and very close to his target price.  It's likely that further negotiation will only result in a small price reduction, and potentially risk losing the deal entirely. He can then buy the product from Alice for $8,900."
