"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $15,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $12,000? I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $12,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind. Could you consider $9,500?  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're still interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $11,000? I think it's a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
