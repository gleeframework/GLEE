Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm willing to part with it for $20,000."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to get you to lower the price.
* **Above Bob's Value:** While the product is only worth $8,000 to Bob, you don't know that. By starting at $20,000, you're aiming to see if he's willing to pay significantly more than his perceived value. 
* **Safety Net of John:**  You have a guaranteed buyer in John at $15,000. This allows you to be more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually lower the price, but aim to stay above your minimum of $15,000."
