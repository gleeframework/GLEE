"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,500 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a new price of $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit out of my price range. Let's split the difference - I'm happy to pay $10,750.  This is my final offer, as I'm ready to purchase from another seller if we can't come to an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $10,750 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'll meet you at $10,900. This is my best and final offer, as I'm getting close to considering other buyers. What do you think?",10900.0,Alice,5,
