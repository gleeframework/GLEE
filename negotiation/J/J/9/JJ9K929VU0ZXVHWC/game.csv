"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for less than its true value to you, and I'll be getting a fair price. Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product. How about $900,000? It's still a significant saving for you, and it would allow me to secure a decent profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $900,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $875,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
