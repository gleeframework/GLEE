,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900000 simply doesn't reflect the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This price still allows for a profitable margin for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $1200000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950000 remains significantly below the product's real value.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1100000. This is my final concession, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your final concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $1100000. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
