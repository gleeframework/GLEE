"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $9,000, which would be $8,500. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,4,
