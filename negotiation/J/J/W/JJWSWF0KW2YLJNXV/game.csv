"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,350,000?  That way, we both get a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000. This would be a good middle ground for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,325,000 is still not quite meeting my expectations. Let's try one last compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,340,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good opportunity to finalize the deal. What do you say?",1340000.0,Alice,5,
