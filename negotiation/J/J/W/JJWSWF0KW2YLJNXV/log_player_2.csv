{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting allows you to counter-offer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,350,000?  That way, we both get a good deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, you're still aiming to save as much as possible. Rejecting allows you to continue negotiating and see if you can get closer to $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000. This would be a good middle ground for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,325,000 is still not quite meeting my expectations. Let's try one last compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,340,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good opportunity to finalize the deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,340,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,340,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,340,000 is only $40,000 more than what John is selling it for.  While you'd ideally get it for $1,325,000, continuing to negotiate might risk Alice walking away and leaving you with only John's option.  Accepting now secures a good deal within your budget."
