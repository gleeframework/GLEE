"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your suggestion, $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to pay $100 for the product, given its value to me.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $110.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
