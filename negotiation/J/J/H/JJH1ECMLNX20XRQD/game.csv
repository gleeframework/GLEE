"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your generosity. However, I am unable to meet the price of $1,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm sticking with $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a mutually beneficial deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
