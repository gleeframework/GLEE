"Hello Bob, it's great to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for both of us. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and acknowledging the value of the product. While I understand your perspective on the price, $600,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,400,000 is still outside my budget. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but I have a firm limit. Would you consider $700,000? This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while staying within my constraints.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, the $700,000 offer is still considerably lower than what I can accept.  Let's try to find a middle ground - how about $1,100,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility. I understand this product holds significant value, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. To be completely transparent, my absolute maximum budget is $800,000. If you're willing to consider this, I'm ready to close the deal today.",800000.0,Bob,6,
