"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, it's great to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's significantly more than your $800,000 limit and even exceeds her own valuation. Rejecting this offer and providing a counteroffer is the best way to start negotiating a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for both of us. Would you consider $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $600,000 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, it's a strategic starting point. It leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Within Budget:** This counteroffer stays well within your $800,000 maximum budget.
* **Respectful but Firm:**  The message acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating your position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and acknowledging the value of the product. While I understand your perspective on the price, $600,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $1,400,000 is still far beyond your budget. It's important to demonstrate that you're serious about a price closer to your range. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,400,000 is still outside my budget. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but I have a firm limit. Would you consider $700,000? This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while staying within my constraints."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Offer, Firm Limit:**  Increasing the offer to $700,000 shows you're willing to negotiate upwards.  Clearly stating your ""firm limit"" emphasizes that you're being serious and realistic.
* **Finding Common Ground:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground where Alice still makes a significant profit, and you get the product at a price you can afford.
* **Time Consideration:**  We're in round 4, so it's crucial to start moving towards a potential agreement.  Continuing to lowball could make Alice lose interest."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I value your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, the $700,000 offer is still considerably lower than what I can accept.  Let's try to find a middle ground - how about $1,100,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $1,100,000 is still significantly over your budget. Alice is making concessions, but it's important to hold firm to your limit and continue negotiating.  You're now halfway through the rounds, so the pressure is on to reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility. I understand this product holds significant value, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. To be completely transparent, my absolute maximum budget is $800,000. If you're willing to consider this, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is your last and final offer. By stating your absolute maximum budget, you're being transparent and showing a sense of urgency.
* **Walking Away Point:** By framing it as a ""take it or leave it"" deal, you're also subtly implying that you might consider John's offer if Alice rejects it.
* **Respectful and Decisive:** The message remains respectful, acknowledging Alice's position while firmly stating your limits and desired outcome.

This strategy puts the ball firmly in Alice's court. It's now up to her to decide if she's willing to accept a lower profit margin to close the deal or risk losing the sale altogether."
