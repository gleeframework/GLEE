# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $22,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. It's in my best interest to reject this offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $22,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  I could consider coming down to $19,000. This reflects the value and quality you'll be receiving. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $19,000 is still above my maximum budget.  I'm going to reject her offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $19,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm getting. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be fair to myself as well.  $12,000 is simply too low for the quality and benefits this product offers.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,500? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,500 is still above my budget. While it's a step in the right direction, I'm not sure I can negotiate it down any further in the remaining rounds. To avoid the risk of going over budget, I'm going to buy the product from John for $10,000."
