"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $12000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $8500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $8500 is lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $10000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to move closer to my target price.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9000.  This is my absolute maximum, as I have another option for $8000.  Let me know if this works for you.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and your need to stay within your budget. I'm willing to go down to $9500 for the product. This is a great deal for both of us, and it would be a shame to miss this opportunity.  Let's close this deal. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,5,
