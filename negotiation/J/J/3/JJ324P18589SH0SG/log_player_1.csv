{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* This offer gives me a decent profit, but it's also low enough to incentivize Bob to counteroffer.  
* The message is friendly and creates a sense of opportunity for Bob. 

I'm hoping Bob will counteroffer, allowing me to gauge his interest and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement. If he doesn't counter, I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $12000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $8500 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I need to see if I can get closer to that value through further negotiation. 

I'm choosing to **reject Bob's offer** and proceed to the next round. This will allow me to make a counteroffer and see if I can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $8,500 is lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to move closer to my target price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $10,000:** This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still maintaining a significant profit for myself. It's a reasonable midpoint that encourages further negotiation.
* **Positive message:**  My message reinforces Bob's interest and emphasizes the value he would be getting at this price. It's a friendly approach that keeps the negotiation amicable.

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if he doesn't. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price of $15,000 through further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9000.  This is my absolute maximum, as I have another option for $8000.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I am hoping to get closer to that value through further negotiation.  

I'm choosing to **reject Bob's offer** and proceed to the next round. This will allow me to make a counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground. It's still possible to get closer to my target price."

```
