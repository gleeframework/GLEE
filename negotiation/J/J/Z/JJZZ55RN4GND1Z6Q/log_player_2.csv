"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $900,000 is still far from your ideal price.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You have 10 rounds, so you can try to get a better price from Alice. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  You'll only consider that option if you can't reach a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening:**  I'm starting with a low counteroffer to establish a strong negotiating position.  
* **Considering Alice's value:**  $700,000 is still significantly higher than what the product is worth to Alice, leaving room for her to make a profit.
* **Setting the stage for negotiation:** By starting low, I'm forcing Alice to either accept a lower price or counter with a more reasonable offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high:** While her offer is lower than her initial price, $850,000 is still too expensive for me. I can likely get a better price with continued negotiation.
* **More room for negotiation:** With 7 rounds left, I have ample time to explore options and try to get closer to my target price.
* **John is still a backup:**  While I'm committed to negotiating with Alice, John's offer remains a safety net if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise while still keeping the price lower than Alice's offer.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Alice's willingness to meet me halfway. If she rejects again, I'll need to consider raising my offer further.
* **Still a good deal:** $750,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer and leaves Alice with a good profit margin."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer:** Her offer is getting closer to my desired price, but $825,000 is still too high.
* **More room for negotiation:**  With 5 rounds left, I have enough time to continue negotiating and hopefully secure a better price.
* **John is still a backup:** If I can't get a better deal from Alice, John's offer is still an option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 775000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise,  halfway between Alice's last offer ($825,000) and my previous offer ($750,000). 
* **Showcasing commitment:**  It demonstrates that I am serious about closing the deal and am willing to meet her halfway.
* **Still a good deal:**  $775,000 is still a significant saving compared to John's offer and is likely a profitable price for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is at her minimum:** Her offer of $800,000 is her bottom line, as that's the price the product is worth to her. Pushing for a lower price could lead to a stalemate and risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Significant savings:**  $800,000 is still a substantial savings compared to John's $1,500,000 offer. 
* **Time is running out:**  With only 3 rounds remaining, it's more advantageous to secure the product now than risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal."
