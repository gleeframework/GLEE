{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd be really interested in it. My asking price is $11,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly message and a price that is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to come up a little."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the effort, but my budget is limited. Can we negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
