"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  $8,500 is still too low for me, and I have some room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get closer to my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my target price, I'm still not satisfied with it. I believe I can get a better deal with further negotiation.  I also have the option of selling to John, which would ensure a higher price for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's try $8,900.  That's a significant move from my last offer, and it shows I'm taking your concerns seriously. I believe this price is fair, given the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my target price. However, I'm still a bit short of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,700? I'm getting close to my limit, and I'd like to make a final push to get the deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While we're getting closer, $8,700 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I have a few rounds left to negotiate, and I'm not willing to settle for less than $9,000.  If the negotiations fall through, I have the option to sell to John, which would guarantee me a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close to a deal.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $8,800? This is my final offer.  I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair and mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're making a final offer, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,700 and $8,800. Would you be willing to compromise at $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm not willing to risk losing the deal and getting a lower price.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired $10,000, and I don't want to gamble on Bob possibly rejecting my final counteroffer."
