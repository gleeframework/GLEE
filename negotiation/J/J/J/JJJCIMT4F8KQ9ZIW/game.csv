"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you.  It's worth at least $800,000 to me, and I'm confident it holds the same value for you.  I'm offering it to you for $850,000.  This gives you a chance to acquire it at a premium, while still ensuring I receive a fair price. Let me know what you think!",850000.0,Alice,1,
