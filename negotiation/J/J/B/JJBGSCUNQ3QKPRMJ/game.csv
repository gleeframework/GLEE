"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $90 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider a price of $70? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $70 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference at $85? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's make a deal!",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $70 and $85, which would be $77.50. Would you be open to considering this offer?",77.5,Bob,4,
