# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. I understand it's worth $1500000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1200000. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  While you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, saving you $300,000.
* **This is a good deal for you.** You're still getting a valuable product for significantly less than your maximum budget."
