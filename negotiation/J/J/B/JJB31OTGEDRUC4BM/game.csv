"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product is high, but given my budget, I would like to propose a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about we aim for $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, reflecting the value of the product. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say? ",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,550,000.  This is a fair offer considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. ",1550000.0,Alice,5,
