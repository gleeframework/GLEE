"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let's make this happen! "", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $1,000,000. I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my minimum value ($1,500,000) while leaving room for negotiation. This strategy allows me to potentially secure a better price, but also provides a safety net by ensuring I can still sell to John for my minimum desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product is high, but given my budget, I would like to propose a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about we aim for $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to secure a higher price. I still have 8 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, reflecting the value of the product. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say? "", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000, which is still above my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. I'm hoping this offer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but still leaves room for potential further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000 for the product. This still leaves me with some savings while acknowledging the value of your offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum desired price, it's still below my target. I have time to negotiate further, so I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I still have 6 rounds left, and I believe I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,550,000.  This is a fair offer considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,550,000, which is only $50,000 above my minimum desired price.  This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable deal for me.  It's time to see if Bob will bite."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Given my budget, I would like to propose a final price of $1,500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum desired price, and I've already established that I can sell to John for that amount. It's a fair deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
