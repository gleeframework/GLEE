Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $9000 is a more reasonable price for the product. I'd like to buy the product for $9000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm aiming for a higher price, and $9,000 is still below my minimum. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $9,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's a fair price considering the value to you. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'll counteroffer again."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a little further, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  I'm proposing $10,000. That's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a good compromise. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $10000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9500, which was my previous offer. How about we go with $9750?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750

$9,750 is close enough to my minimum of $8,000 and it's better than selling to John. I'll accept Bob's offer."
