Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate if he rejects the initial offer.  It's also a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay more than $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product but would be willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a great deal for a product you'll really enjoy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $105. This is a compromise, but it's still within my minimum acceptable range. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to buy the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $95. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable going below $100. It's clear Bob is determined to pay as little as possible, and further negotiations might just lead to a stalemate. Selling to John for $100 guarantees me a decent profit and saves me the hassle of further negotiation."
