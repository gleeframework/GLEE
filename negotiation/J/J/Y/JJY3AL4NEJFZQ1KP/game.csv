"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,100,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for a bit less.  How about $1,000,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get the product for a bit less, but I have to make sure I'm getting a fair price for it. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for a little less.  How about $1,025,000?  That's a good middle ground and a fair price for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're looking for a good middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not giving away too much. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is a fair price, and I think it's a great compromise.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
