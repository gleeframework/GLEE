"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you're willing to pay a maximum of $12,000, and Alice's offer is exactly that price, there's no benefit in accepting it.  You can get the same product from John for the same price, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice."
