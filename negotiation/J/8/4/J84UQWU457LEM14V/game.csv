"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to get at least $1,150,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I still feel that $1,150,000 is beyond my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,125,000. This price aligns more closely with my financial capacity while still reflecting the value of the product. I hope this proposal will lead to a mutually agreeable solution.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
