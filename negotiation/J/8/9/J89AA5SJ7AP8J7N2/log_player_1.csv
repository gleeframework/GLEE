Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. Bob knows the product is worth $120 to him, so there's potential for a deal that benefits both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to keep my spending within $80 for this item. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is your minimum price, you know the product is worth $120 to Bob. There's still room to negotiate a price that's more favorable to you.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $80 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a little to $90.  That way we can both be happy with the transaction. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. I'll stick to my budget of $80 for this product. Could you possibly meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is adamant about his $80 price point, and you've already lowered your price to $90. At this point, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome. Selling to John guarantees you your minimum price, securing a sale without further haggling."
