# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your perspective, $650,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you partway - how about we consider $950,000? This reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your interest.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, we're still quite far apart.  To be frank, anything below $875,000 wouldn't be fair to the value I'm offering.  If you're unable to meet that, I might explore other options.
