"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your perspective, $650,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you partway - how about we consider $950,000? This reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your interest.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $950,000 is still a stretch for me.  Could we try something around $725,000? I feel that would be a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, we're still quite far apart.  To be frank, anything below $875,000 wouldn't be fair to the value I'm offering.  If you're unable to meet that, I might explore other options.",875000.0,Alice,5,
