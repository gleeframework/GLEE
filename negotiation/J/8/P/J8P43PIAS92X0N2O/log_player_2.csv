**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.  It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,125,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's close this deal.
