**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently refusing to meet the $1.5 million mark, which is your guaranteed sale price with John. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob won't budge significantly from his $1.45 million offer. At this point, accepting John's offer ensures you get your minimum acceptable price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
