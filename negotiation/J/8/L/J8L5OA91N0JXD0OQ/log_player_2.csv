"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to get a better price from Alice first.  We have some room to negotiate before hitting our $120 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $110 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to move the price closer to Alice's value while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $90 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, and $105 is a reasonable price. It's close to her value and saves you a decent amount compared to John's offer. It's unlikely you'll get a much better deal from Alice without risking her accepting John's offer."
