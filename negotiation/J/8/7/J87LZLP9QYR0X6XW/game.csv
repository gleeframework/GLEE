"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit rich for me right now. I'm interested, but I'd need to be closer to the $650,000 mark to make this work.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I think that's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can make this deal work.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
