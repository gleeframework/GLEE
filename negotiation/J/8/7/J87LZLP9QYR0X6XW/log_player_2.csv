"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit rich for me right now. I'm interested, but I'd need to be closer to the $650,000 mark to make this work."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Alice is coming down, but we're still a good bit away from our ideal price and John's offer. Let's see if we can push her a little further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I think that's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

Alice has met our maximum budget. There's no point in going to John, as they offer the same price. We've successfully negotiated a good deal!"
