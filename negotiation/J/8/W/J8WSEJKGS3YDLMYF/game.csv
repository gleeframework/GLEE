"I understand where you're coming from, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try 110? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference and try $105? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're a savvy negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to give a bit more, but I'm not willing to go all the way to 105. How about we meet at 108? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",108.0,Alice,5,
