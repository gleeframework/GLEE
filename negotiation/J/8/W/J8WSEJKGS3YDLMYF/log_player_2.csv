"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. There's a good chance she might be willing to go lower, and you have room to maneuver before needing to go to John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try 110? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. You're still $10 below your absolute limit ($150) and it's worth trying another counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference and try $105? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're a savvy negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to give a bit more, but I'm not willing to go all the way to 105. How about we meet at 108? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While you could try another counteroffer, you're now only $3 away from your absolute limit with John. Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product for a good price and avoids the risk of Alice walking away or you having to pay more to John."
