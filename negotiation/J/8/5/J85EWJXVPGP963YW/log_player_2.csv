"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good starting point, it's still above Bob's target of $1,000,000. By rejecting, Bob can start the negotiation process and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to discuss this. However,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his target, it's still above $1,000,000. Bob has more leverage because he can still buy from John. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This shows my commitment to making this happen. Let's see if we can close the gap."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I need to make a bit more on this deal. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000, but that's as high as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting very close to his target, he still has leverage with John's offer. He can try to push Alice down a little further to reach his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting very close.  I'm willing to go to $1,078,000. This is almost my absolute limit, but I really want to work with you on this deal.  Let's find a way to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1078000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this deal, Bob. I appreciate your enthusiasm. I'm willing to meet you at $1,078,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. However, I'll throw in a sweetener - I'll include some additional support and maintenance services with the product, which is worth $20,000. So, if you're willing to meet me at $1,078,000, I'll include the services for free. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,078,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,078,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. This is a great deal for him, as he's getting the product for only slightly above his target price and also receiving additional support and maintenance services worth $20,000. It's highly unlikely he'll be able to get a better deal than this, especially with the additional value of the services."
