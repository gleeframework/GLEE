Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I like the spirit of compromise, but I'm still a bit far from your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $11,750. How about we do $12,125? This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,125.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $12,000, and we are already in round 7. It's better to secure the product from John at $12,000 than to risk Alice not going any lower."
