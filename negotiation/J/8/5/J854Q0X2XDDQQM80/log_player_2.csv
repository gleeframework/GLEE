"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best price possible, so he's starting with a significant counteroffer. He's offering $10,500, which is $1,000 below Alice's initial offer. This is a reasonable starting point considering the product is worth $10,000 to Alice. If Alice rejects, Bob can continue to negotiate and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the best possible price. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, he can likely get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering $10,750, which is a slight increase from his previous offer. This shows Alice that he's willing to compromise, but he's still aiming for a price closer to his own valuation of the product. This offer is also still below Alice's offer of $11,000, demonstrating a continued negotiation effort."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is close to Bob's last counteroffer of $10,750. This suggests a compromise is within reach.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a price significantly lower than John's offer of $12,000 and is within Bob's budget."
