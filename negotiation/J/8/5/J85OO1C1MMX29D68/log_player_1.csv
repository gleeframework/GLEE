I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation.  I want to see if I can get a higher price, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get a little closer to my initial asking price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob a price in the middle of our valuations.  I hope this will be appealing enough for him to accept, but I'm still confident that I can sell to John if needed."
