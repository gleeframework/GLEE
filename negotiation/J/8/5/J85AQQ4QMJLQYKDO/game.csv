"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to negotiate a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $1,075,000? I think that's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,075,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $1,100,000? This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
