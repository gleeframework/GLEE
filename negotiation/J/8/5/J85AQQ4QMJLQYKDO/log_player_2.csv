# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to negotiate a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,075,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $1,100,000? This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled this is her final offer. While we could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are getting smaller and we risk pushing Alice away. Accepting at $1,100,000 secures a significant discount from both Alice's initial offer and John's price."
