"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I understand your perspective, I'm not able to go as low as $850,000.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This price still allows me to achieve a good return while recognizing the value the product holds for your business.",925000.0,Alice,3,
