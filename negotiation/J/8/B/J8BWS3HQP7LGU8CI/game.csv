"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested, but only if we can get closer to $7,000. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
