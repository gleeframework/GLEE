"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value for both of us. This product is not just an item; it's a gateway to experiences and possibilities that can significantly impact your life positively. Given its significance, I understand its worth to you stands at $10,000. However, considering its rarity and the effort put into acquiring it, I propose a transaction price of $12,000. This offer allows you to enjoy a substantial discount compared to its market value while ensuring a fair return for me. I believe this price strikes a balance between our interests and respects the intrinsic value of the product. Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations, and we can proceed with the transaction. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is a discount from the market value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. He can get the same product from John for $10,000, making it the more financially beneficial option."
