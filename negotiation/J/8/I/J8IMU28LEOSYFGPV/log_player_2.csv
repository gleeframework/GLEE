Alice's offer:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to you ($90 vs $100). It's worth exploring if you can get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I need to make a profit. I can do $87.50 for the product. Is that more to your liking? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still a bit higher than what you're willing to pay. You've already made a counteroffer, so there's room to keep negotiating.  Let's see if we can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, but $87.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $86 for it.  Let's see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 86}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $88 for the product. Is that a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $88 is very close to your target price of $85.  It's a good deal, considering you can always buy from John for $100.  There's a good chance Alice won't come down further, so it's worth accepting this offer to secure the product."
