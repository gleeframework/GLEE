Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

This offer leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a price closer to the value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'll counter-offer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I still need to make a profit. $9,000 seems like a fair compromise, considering Bob's offer was still below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is finally above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. It's still less than what I initially hoped for, but it's a better outcome than selling to John."
