Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Bob's offer:

I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,575,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.

Although we could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $1,575,000 is a good deal. We are well above Bob's perceived value and significantly exceeding John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away altogether."
