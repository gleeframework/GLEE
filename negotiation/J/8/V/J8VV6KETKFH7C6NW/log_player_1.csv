{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer is the starting point. It is important to note that:

* **I am aiming high.**  Starting at my minimum acceptable price ($150) gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit.
* **I am being polite and friendly.** This helps build rapport and can make Bob more receptive to negotiation. 
* **I am providing a reason for the price.** This helps justify the price and makes it seem more reasonable. 

We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me, would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While it's tempting to accept $60, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I need to hold firm and see if I can get closer to my target price.

I will counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $60 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. This product is worth a lot more, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm still holding firm on my minimum acceptable price, but I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. By dropping the price to $120, I'm demonstrating flexibility. 

I am also:

* **Reiterating the value of the product.** This helps remind Bob of its worth and justifies my asking price.
* **Expressing confidence in the product's value.** This reinforces my belief in the product's worth and may make Bob more likely to consider a higher price.

I'll see how Bob responds to this counteroffer and adjust my strategy as needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I could go up to $75, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $75 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price. 

I've already given Bob a substantial discount from my initial asking price, and it's clear we're too far apart in our valuations.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with him.

I will sell the product to John for $150. This ensures that I get my minimum acceptable price and avoid the risk of a prolonged negotiation that might not result in a profitable deal."
