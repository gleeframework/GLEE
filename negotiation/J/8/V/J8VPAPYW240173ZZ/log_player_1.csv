Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm running out of time and this offer is still above my minimum threshold of $8,000. It's important to reach a compromise and secure the sale before running the risk of losing the deal altogether."
