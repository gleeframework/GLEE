"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can exceed your expectations.  I'd like to start the conversation at $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see its potential, $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best possible price. He's offering a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still higher than Alice's minimum value. This should open a negotiation window, and hopefully Alice will counter with a more favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but I know the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue trying to get a better deal.  It's possible Alice will be willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,075,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of getting the best possible price, while also being realistic about Alice's willingness to negotiate.  He's offering a price that's a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's counteroffer.  This shows he's serious about buying the product, but still wants a better deal."
