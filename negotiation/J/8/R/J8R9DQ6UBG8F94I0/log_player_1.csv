"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $9,000.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still giving me a profit above my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, we'll see how the negotiation goes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell it for less than my minimum of $8,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500. This is a good compromise, as it's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. Hopefully, he'll see that it's a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum price, so I'll accept it. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John and I still have a good chance to close the deal with Bob in the future if I manage to build a good relationship with him."
