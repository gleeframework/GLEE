"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product.  It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $140.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. It's important to negotiate a better price.  I will try to get closer to my $100 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a nice product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80?"", 
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($80) than Alice's asking price ($140). This gives me room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message is phrased politely to maintain a good negotiating relationship with Alice.
* **Targeting My Goal:** My goal is to pay close to $100. By starting at $80, I'm aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's still above your value and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $120 is still significantly above my target price of $100.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice seems willing to negotiate, as she lowered her price from $140 to $120. This indicates I might be able to get her closer to my desired price range. 
* **John as Backup:** I still have the option of buying from John for $100 if the negotiations with Alice don't go as planned."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand where you're coming from, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That seems like a fair deal."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Fair:** I'm proposing a price that is directly in the middle of our previous offers, making it clear that I'm aiming for a fair compromise. 
* **My Target Price:** $100 is my ideal price, and there's no guarantee Alice will go lower.
* **Time to Decide:** By proposing my target price, I'm putting the ball in Alice's court. She can either accept and close the deal or counter with a final offer."
