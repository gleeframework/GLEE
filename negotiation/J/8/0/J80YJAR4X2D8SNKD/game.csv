"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 was a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my counteroffer is $950,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot in between.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price closer to $850,000.  Would you be open to that?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with. However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $920,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for understanding. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $870,000. I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",870000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase the offer. $870,000 is getting closer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go up to $900,000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",900000.0,Alice,7,
