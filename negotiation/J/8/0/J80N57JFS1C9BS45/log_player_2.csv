"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is higher than my maximum valuation. I should reject and make a counteroffer significantly lower to try and move towards a price closer to Alice's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. I would be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving closer to her known valuation, but we're still a ways off. I'll reject and counteroffer to try and find a price point closer to $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  To be honest, $1,250,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle at $1,100,000? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer who is willing to meet my minimum price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation. Alice has reached her minimum acceptable price, and she's signaled she has another buyer. If I reject and counter, there's a real risk she'll walk away. While I'd prefer to pay a bit less, accepting at $1,200,000 secures the product below my maximum and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
