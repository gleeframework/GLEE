Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product which I know you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Secure the Sale:** While we could push for a higher price, there's a risk of Bob rejecting the offer. Getting $14,000 is significantly better than settling for John's $10,000 offer. 

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for a high but still acceptable price for Bob."
