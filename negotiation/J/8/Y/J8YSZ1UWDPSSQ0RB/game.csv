"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $12,000.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value this product brings.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. How about we split the difference at $12,500? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
