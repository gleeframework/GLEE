Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, I can afford to start high. Offering it at $2,000,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming to maximize profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" aims to justify the high price, potentially swaying Bob towards accepting. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message keeps the conversation open. If Bob counters, I can negotiate down towards my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John is a guaranteed backup provides me with a strong position in the negotiation."
