"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this works for you!",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about we settle at $775,000? That's a reasonable compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still a bit above $775,000. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000. This is a good price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let's see if we can seal the deal!",825000.0,Alice,5,
