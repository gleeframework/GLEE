"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to me. This unique item is worth $1,500,000 to me, reflecting its significance and quality. Given its worth to you, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us if we could come to an agreement that respects its true value. Therefore, I am offering you the chance to purchase this product for $1,200,000. This price not only reflects the value I place on the item but also allows for a fair transaction that considers your assessment of its worth at $800,000. I am confident that this proposal will lead to a mutually satisfactory outcome. Please let me know if you are interested in discussing further details or proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John at your target price.  Therefore, it makes the most sense to reject Alice's offer and proceed with purchasing from John."
