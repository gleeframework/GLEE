"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint and need to make sure it fits within it. Can you consider my counteroffer?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"I see you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. Let's try $9800 for the product. It's a bit higher than your last offer but still below the original price. I hope this meets your budget considerations.",9800.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9800 and my last offer of $9000. How about we try $9400? I think that's a fair price for this product.",9400.0,Bob,6,
