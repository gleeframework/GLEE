(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. You should reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is your maximum budget, and you're aiming to buy the product for the lowest possible price. You're hoping Alice will see the value in selling to you rather than dealing with John, but you're ready to walk away if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price. There's room for further negotiation, and it's worth trying to get closer to your target of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a compromise. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still a substantial amount, showing you're serious about buying the product. This offer gives Alice an incentive to negotiate further while keeping you closer to your goal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for your budget.  While you could accept and pay $1,050,000, it's worth trying to negotiate one more time to see if you can get closer to your desired price. It's possible that with one more counteroffer, Alice might be willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This final counteroffer is a compromise. It's a significant increase from your previous offer, showing that you're willing to meet Alice halfway. However, it's still below Alice's last offer and is closer to your desired price point.  This offer gives Alice a clear decision point: either accept and make a small profit, or risk losing the deal to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget than before, it's still outside of your ideal range.  Further negotiation might yield a slightly lower price, but the risk is that Alice will continue to hold out, driving the price up again.  At this point, it's more advantageous to go with John's offer. You've already been through multiple rounds of negotiations, and John's offer is guaranteed and within your budget."
