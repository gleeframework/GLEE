"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to do business together. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000, which is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's worth $1,000,000 to me, and her offer is $200,000 more than that.  It makes sense to try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make the purchase and giving you a decent return on your investment."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1050000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1150000. This is a fair price that still gives me a good return on my investment, and I believe you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than my maximum budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000 but not beyond that.  It's worth pushing to see if I can get her to budge further."
