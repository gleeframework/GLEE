"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to do business together. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000, which is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1050000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make the purchase and giving you a decent return on your investment.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1050000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1150000. This is a fair price that still gives me a good return on my investment, and I believe you'll be happy with the deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice. However, $1150000 is still a bit too high for me.  As I mentioned, I'm willing to go up to $1050000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
