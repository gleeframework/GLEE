"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and significantly lower than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you money."
