"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the value I place on it, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,000,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $950,000?  That's a fair compromise, I think.",950000.0,Bob,4,
