# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item, and I think you'll really appreciate its features.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,750. This is a great compromise that still gives you a good deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Bob should buy the product from John.  He is willing to sell it for $10,000, which is the best possible price for Bob. While Alice has come down in price, it is still not worth it for Bob to continue negotiating."
