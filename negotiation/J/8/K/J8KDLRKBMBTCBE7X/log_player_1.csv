Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  However, I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $100, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $80 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I value the product at.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob, or at least get closer to my desired price point before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a good deal for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
