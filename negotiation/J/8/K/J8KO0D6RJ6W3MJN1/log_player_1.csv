Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $175. This is a price that is higher than his valuation of $100, but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate if he rejects the initial offer. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is higher than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $140 to Bob. This is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it's a significant increase from his offer of $120, showing I'm willing to negotiate. This price is also closer to my desired range, and I'm confident that I can secure a deal at a price that is closer to my valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and significantly less than my desired outcome. I'm confident that I can get a better price from John, so I'll sell the product to him for $150."
