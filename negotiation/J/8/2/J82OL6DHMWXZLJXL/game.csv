"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've carefully nurtured and developed, and I know you would appreciate its potential. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, a price that reflects its worth and allows for a fair margin for both of us.  This is a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let me know if you're interested.",12000.0,Alice,1,
