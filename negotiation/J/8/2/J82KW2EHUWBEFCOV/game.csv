"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too far below my desired price.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, recognizing your interest in the product. I believe this price reflects the value it offers. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. However, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering the potential risks and rewards involved.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $700,000 is a step in the right direction, we're still a bit apart.  I'm willing to come down further to $850,000. This price reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
