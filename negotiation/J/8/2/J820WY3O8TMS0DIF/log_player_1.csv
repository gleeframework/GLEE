While we could push Bob a little further, accepting his offer of $795,000 is the most strategically sound decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Profit Maximization:** Holding out for the full $800,000 might backfire, risking the deal altogether. Accepting $795,000 secures a substantial profit and avoids the potential loss of the sale.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate cash flow, which is generally more valuable than a potentially slightly higher amount later.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate can strain the relationship and potentially lead to an impasse. Accepting shows goodwill and a desire to finalize the deal. 

Accepting Bob's offer at $795,000 provides the best balance of risk and reward at this stage of the negotiation."
