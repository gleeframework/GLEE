"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me. This is to leave room for negotiation and potentially get a higher price, but still within a range that Bob might find reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than my minimum, I'm not yet satisfied. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still below my ideal selling price. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not willing to settle for too low a price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to my desired price, and we are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and is a good compromise, considering I have a guaranteed backup offer from John."
