"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,050,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm still looking to get closer to the original price I had in mind. I can meet you at $1,075,000, which is a bit above your offer, but still a compromise from my original price. Let me know if this works for you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price for your product, and I'm trying to get the best deal for myself. $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me. However, I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000.  This is a fair compromise that's closer to your last offer but still within my budget. What do you think?",1025000.0,Bob,6,
