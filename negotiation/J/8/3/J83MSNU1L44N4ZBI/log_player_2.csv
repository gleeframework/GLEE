The product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and Alice is asking for $1,200,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me at this price.

While $1,100,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your desired price point. It's worth trying to negotiate further to get closer to $1,000,000."
