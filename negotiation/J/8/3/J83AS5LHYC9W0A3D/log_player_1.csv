{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation but still aiming high.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's significantly less than my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'll reject his offer and see if we can reach a more acceptable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,000,000. This is still above my minimum value, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I hope this counteroffer will be more appealing to him, and we can reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum value. I'm not willing to sell for less than what I consider the product to be worth. I will reject his offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $900,000. This is a compromise, but I'm still confident in the value of the product. Hopefully, this offer will be more enticing to Bob, and we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob has increased his offer again, it's still not close enough to my minimum value. I'm tired of negotiating with him and I'm not willing to sell for less than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  It's a guaranteed sale at a reasonable price."
