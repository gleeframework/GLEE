Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $12,000 as possible, as that's your guaranteed sale price from John.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at slightly below your guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and a perceived ""deal"" for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, this price leaves a tiny bit of room for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly eager. 

This strategy prioritizes securing the highest possible profit while still making the offer enticing to Bob."
