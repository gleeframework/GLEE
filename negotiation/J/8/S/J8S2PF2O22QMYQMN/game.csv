"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is really the lowest I can go right now.  This product is a game-changer, and I'm confident it will bring you a significant return on your investment. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to meet you at $1,600,000. My maximum budget remains at $1,200,000. I hope we can find a middle ground that satisfies both parties.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
