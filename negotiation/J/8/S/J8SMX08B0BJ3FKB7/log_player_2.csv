"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is within your budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to you. You can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $105, which is halfway between Alice's offer and my maximum price. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also trying to get a fair price.  It leaves room for negotiation while still potentially saving me some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is now within my acceptable range, and it's a good price considering John is selling the product for $120. There is a chance I could negotiate further, but the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and me ending up having to buy from John is too high.  Accepting this offer is the best course of action to secure the product at a reasonable price."
