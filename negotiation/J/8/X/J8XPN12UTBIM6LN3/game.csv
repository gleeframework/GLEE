"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, which is still a good price for you considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $130. This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to pay $115 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's closer to your desired price and still within my budget. Let's find a middle ground.",115.0,Bob,4,
