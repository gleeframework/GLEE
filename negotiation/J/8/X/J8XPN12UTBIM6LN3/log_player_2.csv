"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $100. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, which is still a good price for you considering the product's value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $130. This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum limit of $100. It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate further. There's a good chance you can get Alice to come down even more."

This is a fair price for both of us, as it's closer to your desired price and still within my budget. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 115}
