"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and your need to sell. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  This allows you a healthy profit margin while ensuring I don't lose out on this deal. Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
