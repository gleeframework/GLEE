"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount considering its value to me. I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay $1,200,000.  You should counteroffer Alice to see if you can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  This allows you a healthy profit margin while ensuring I don't lose out on this deal. Let's find a way to make this work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

While $1,000,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your budget. You can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's no need to accept Alice's offer yet. You should counteroffer Alice again to see if you can get closer to your target price."
