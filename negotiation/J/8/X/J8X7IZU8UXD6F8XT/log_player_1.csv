Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount considering its value to me. I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000:** This price is above Bob's valuation of $800,000, giving him a potential profit if he resells. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential benefit for Bob. It also sets a clear expectation that this is a starting point for negotiation. 

**Why this approach?**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  By starting high, you give yourself room to negotiate downwards while still aiming for a profit that exceeds your minimum.
* **Flexibility:**  This strategy allows for a dynamic negotiation where you can adjust your offer based on Bob's response.
* **Maintaining Options:**  You're not immediately locking yourself into a deal with Bob, allowing you to maintain the option of selling to John if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and your need to sell. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a huge loss for me.  It's better to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range.  I'll keep in mind that John is willing to pay $1,500,000, so I have a strong fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  This allows you a healthy profit margin while ensuring I don't lose out on this deal. Let's find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Reasoning:** My counteroffer of $1,000,000 is a compromise that allows me to maintain a decent profit while acknowledging Bob's budget limitations. It's a significant reduction from my initial offer but still considerably higher than Bob's initial offer. 
* **Message Tone:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes mutual benefit. It highlights the discount offered, aiming to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Strategic Approach:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward. It creates a clearer path to a potential agreement without immediately resorting to selling to John.  I'm strategically aiming for a price within the ""sweet spot"" where both parties can potentially benefit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This offer is closer to my budget, but also gives you a significant profit. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my desired range, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further lowering the price, and I'm not confident that I can reach a mutually acceptable price with him.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and ensures a successful transaction."
