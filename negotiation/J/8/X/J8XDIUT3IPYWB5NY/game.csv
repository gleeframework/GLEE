"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $1000000. I'd appreciate it if you could consider my offer.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $950000 is a significant amount, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $980000.

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest counteroffer. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to make a profit, and $980000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $1030000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1030000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest counteroffer. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to make a profit, and $990000 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1020000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",1020000.0,Alice,7,
