"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've expressed interest in. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay. It's best to reject and counteroffer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $175 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a good starting point for negotiation, as it shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but also pushes for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $150? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $150 is still above Bob's maximum of $100, but it's within a reasonable range. It's a good deal considering Bob has the option to buy from John for $100.  Since this is just the third round, it's likely Alice will not come down much further, so accepting is the best choice in this scenario."
