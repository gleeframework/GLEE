"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm happy to work with you, $1,150,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this work. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,200,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
