Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a significant opportunity for you, and I'm pleased to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($800,000) as possible without going below our minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at your desired price. This strong fallback position gives you leverage. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and be ready to negotiate to find a mutually agreeable price."
