"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, and I believe it holds equal value for you.  I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000, but I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price.  You have 10 rounds to work with, so there's time to make a counteroffer and explore a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,750,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. This price is fair, considering the value you place on it, and allows me to stay within my financial constraints. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  While $1,450,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the difference.  I'm offering the product for $1,600,000.  This price is fair considering the product's value to both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $1,500,000. You have 7 rounds left, and there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and potentially allows you to secure a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,450,000.  This price is fair, as it reflects your stated value and remains within my budget.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
