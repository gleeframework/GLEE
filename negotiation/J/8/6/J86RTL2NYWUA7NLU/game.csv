"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,750,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. This price is fair, considering the value you place on it, and allows me to stay within my financial constraints. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  While $1,450,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the difference.  I'm offering the product for $1,600,000.  This price is fair considering the product's value to both of us. ",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,450,000.  This price is fair, as it reflects your stated value and remains within my budget.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
