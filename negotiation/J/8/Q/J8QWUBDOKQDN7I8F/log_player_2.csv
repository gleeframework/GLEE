"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum, there's no reason to accept immediately. You have 10 rounds to potentially negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant discount shows Alice you are serious about negotiating. $11,000 is a reasonable starting point, as it's still within your budget and leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,400, which is a significant discount from her initial offer and within my budget. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk of Alice refusing further offers and pushing me to buy from John at the full price. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product for a good price and saves time."
