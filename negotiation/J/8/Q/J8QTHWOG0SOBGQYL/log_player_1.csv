{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to leave room for negotiation. This also gives me the opportunity to see if Bob is truly interested in the product at a price above what it's worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than what it's worth to me.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is unfortunately below my minimum price point.  How about we split the difference and settle on $77.50? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 77.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose $76 as the price for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $76. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $76
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to $80, Bob's offer of $76 is just above my minimum.  To avoid further negotiation and potential delays, I'll accept his offer and move on."
