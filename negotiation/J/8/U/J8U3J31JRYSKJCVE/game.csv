"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I believe you'll love. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it if we can meet in the middle.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your decision.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I'd like to make an even lower offer. I'm willing to pay $775000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious commitment to purchase the product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to make a slightly more aggressive counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value and your budget.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a compromise, Alice. However, $825000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I'd like to make an even lower offer. I'm willing to pay $775000 for the product, and I'm willing to throw in some extras, such as a free consultation or a warranty, to sweeten the deal. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate the extras you're willing to throw in, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $775000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $800000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your decision.",800000.0,Alice,7,
