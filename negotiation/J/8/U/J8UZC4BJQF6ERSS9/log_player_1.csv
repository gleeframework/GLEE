"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $160. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 160
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired selling point. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $160, there's room for Bob to counteroffer and for you to potentially still reach a price above your minimum of $120. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer will help gauge Bob's level of interest and give you a sense of how the negotiation might proceed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is still significantly below your minimum price of $120.  While it's good that he's engaging in negotiation, it's too early to accept such a low offer. You have room to negotiate further and try to reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you do $140? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (ish):** By countering with $140, you're moving closer to the middle ground between your initial offer and Bob's offer. This can signal a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price above your minimum.
* **Strategic Concession:** While you haven't accepted Bob's price, you are showing flexibility by reducing your initial asking price by $20. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** You're still holding at a price point significantly above Bob's offer, indicating that you believe in the value of your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I would like to counter with an offer of $125. This still allows me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $125 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $120. While you could potentially try to negotiate for a slightly higher amount, accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or the negotiations dragging on."
