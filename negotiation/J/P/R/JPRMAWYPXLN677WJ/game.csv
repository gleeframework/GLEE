"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is fair considering my value for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,000, which reflects the value I place on the product.  I hope you'll consider it.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer of $10,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to compromise further. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product brings to your business.",12000.0,Alice,5,
