Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's higher than your minimum but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate.  It also sets a friendly tone by suggesting the product would be a good fit for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $100 is a little high for me.  How about $90?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is less than the initial asking price of $100, it's still a good deal for Alice. It's significantly more than what she could get from John and is closer to Bob's perceived value of $120.  It also shows Bob that Alice is willing to negotiate and find a solution."
