"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. Considering your offer of $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $950,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a compromise that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I still think it's a little high.  Would you consider $875,000? I feel that's a fair compromise and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better price, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering your offer of $875,000, I'm willing to make a small adjustment and propose a counteroffer of $900,000. This is still a premium price for the product, but I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value it will bring to you.",900000.0,Alice,5,
