"Thanks for the offer, Alice! $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we settle at $115? That's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $115 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $125? It's a good balance between what I'm willing to sell for and what you're willing to pay.",125.0,Alice,5,
