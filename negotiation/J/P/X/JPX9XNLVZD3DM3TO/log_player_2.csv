"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $100.  It's worth attempting to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $125 is better than her initial price, it's still higher than your maximum budget of $100. Since you can buy the product from John for $100, it's worth seeing if you can get a better price from Alice or just go with John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to get it for $105.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you to find a solution. How about we split the difference and settle on $115?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $115 is getting closer to your budget, it's still higher than your desired price point. You can still potentially negotiate further, or simply buy from John for $100, which is a guaranteed lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your effort, but $115 is still more than I can comfortably pay.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close the deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
