,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to get it for $105.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you to find a solution. How about we split the difference and settle on $115?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your effort, but $115 is still more than I can comfortably pay.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close the deal.",110.0,Bob,6,
