Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,750,000. This is a significant premium for Bob, but it gives me room to negotiate if he rejects the offer. I'm confident John will pay my minimum, so I'm not in a rush to settle for less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not that much. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,600,000. It's still above my minimum and a significant premium for Bob, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. This is a good middle ground that could lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm starting to lose patience. I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum.  John is a guaranteed sale, and I'm going to take his offer to avoid further negotiation with Bob."
