"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating.  It's worth a few rounds of counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to drop the price closer to her own valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. This price reflects its worth to me and gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a better deal than Alice's first offer, Bob can still potentially get a better price. He's still well within his budget and has time to negotiate further.  There's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down further, especially since she's already lowered her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $11,750. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is closer to Bob's desired price point, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob has a clear budget limit and should continue to push for a better deal.  It's worth a few more rounds to see if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $11,250. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's the best way to ensure a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has clearly stated this is her lowest offer. While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of reaching an impasse and having to buy from John at a higher price is high.  At $11,500, Bob is still getting a decent deal, saving over $3,500 compared to John's price. It's a good time to accept and finalize the deal."
