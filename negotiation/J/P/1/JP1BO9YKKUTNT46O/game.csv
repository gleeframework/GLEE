"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. This price reflects its worth to me and gives us both a good deal.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $11,250. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's the best way to ensure a mutually beneficial agreement.",11250.0,Bob,6,
