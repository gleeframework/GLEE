"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $12,000.  Let's start there, and we can see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've invested a lot of time and resources into this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $15,000 for it. Can we discuss the details and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500?  It's a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're having a productive conversation. However, I'm still not quite there on the price. I'm willing to consider $14,000, which is a bit closer to my target, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair value for the product. Can we discuss the details and see if we can meet in the middle?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's close this deal.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,500 and $13,000, which is $13,250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,7,
