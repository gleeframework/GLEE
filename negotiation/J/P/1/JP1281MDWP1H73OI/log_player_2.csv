"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's something that can truly make a difference. While I can't disclose the exact details just yet, I'm confident it's worth at least $1500000 to me. I'm offering it to you for $2000000. If you're interested, I'd be happy to share more information and we can discuss the details further.  If this price isn't right for you, I understand, but I believe you'll be missing out on a great opportunity. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $2,000,000, which is more than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's better to reject the offer and buy from John for $1,000,000."
