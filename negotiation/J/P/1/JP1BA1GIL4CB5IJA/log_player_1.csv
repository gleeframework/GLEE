Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is a high initial offer, but it gives me room to negotiate. Since I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, I'm comfortable starting at a higher price. I'm hoping Bob values the product highly enough to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, but I'm still hoping for a better price.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a lower price to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm lowering the price to $1,350,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. It's also still above Bob's offer, leaving room for further discussion. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm starting to feel the pressure from John's guaranteed $1,000,000.  It's time to accept the offer and secure the sale."
