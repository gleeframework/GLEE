Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $140 creates a win-win situation:
    * Bob gets a $40 discount from the product's value to him ($140 instead of $180).
    * I make a $40 profit, which is better than nothing if he rejects the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a higher final price."
