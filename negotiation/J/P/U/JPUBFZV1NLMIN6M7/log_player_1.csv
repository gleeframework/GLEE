Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning the negotiation with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($100). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $95, I signal that I'm open to negotiation but not desperate to sell at a low price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm aware that I have a guaranteed offer from John at $80, which acts as my ""walk-away"" point in this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $95 is a bit too high for me. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $85 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm looking for a better deal. I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation because I have the security of John's offer at $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm looking for something closer to $90.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:**  I'm not drastically reducing my price, demonstrating that I value the product highly.
* **Compromise:** By suggesting a price of $90, I'm meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($85) and my previous asking price ($95). This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Clear Objective:** My message explicitly states my desired price point, making my intention clear."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $90 is still a little too high for me.  How about $87.50?  That's a good compromise and closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $87.50 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80) and provides a good profit margin. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might only yield a few extra dollars, and there's a risk that Bob could walk away from the deal entirely.
* **Time Value:** Accepting now allows me to complete the sale and move on to other potential transactions."
