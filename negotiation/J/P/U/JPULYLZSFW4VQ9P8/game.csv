"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and well above my minimum price.  Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  It's a fair price that considers both our positions.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down on your offer.  However, $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though, and offer the product to you for $850,000. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let me know if this works for you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, and I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about $775,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $825,000 to finalize this deal. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll consider it. Let's make this happen.",825000.0,Alice,5,
