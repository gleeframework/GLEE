"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $12,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price? "", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $15,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial one, it's still above Bob's budget. Since John is offering the product for Bob's maximum price, there's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice."
