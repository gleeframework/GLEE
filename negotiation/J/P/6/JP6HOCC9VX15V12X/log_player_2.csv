Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,050,000 is a step closer,  I'm still a bit away from my target. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $1,100,000. This allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,100,000 is a better offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,075,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,087,500.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,087,500 is a good compromise. It's within my budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer.  While I could continue negotiating, the potential gains are small, and there's a risk of Alice walking away. It's more advantageous to accept this offer and secure the product."
