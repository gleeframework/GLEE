"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your asking price and the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,050,000 is a step closer,  I'm still a bit away from my target. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $1,100,000. This allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,100,000 is a better offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000? It's a good deal for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and you to make a profit.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,075,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,087,500.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
