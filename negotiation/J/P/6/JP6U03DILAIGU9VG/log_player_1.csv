Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high offer close to my ideal price, but still within the range where Bob might be willing to negotiate.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  I'm emphasizing the value to Bob to make the offer seem reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for negotiation, making it clear that I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us. 

This strategy allows me to potentially secure a higher price while also keeping the negotiation open and leaving room to adjust my offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price more around $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I would get from the product. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $1,200,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I need to make sure I get at least that much.
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's still room for negotiation. Bob clearly values the product at $1,500,000, so there's a chance I can get closer to that price with another counteroffer. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always fall back on selling to John for $1,000,000. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiations open and have the opportunity to potentially earn a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still reflects the value you'll get from the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above my minimum:** $1,300,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I get a good deal.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm again emphasizing the value Bob will gain from the product to justify my price.
* **Open to further discussion:** I'm using language that encourages continued negotiation, leaving the door open for further adjustments.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still securing a price that meets my minimum requirements and leaves room for potential further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price or a stalemate, and I could end up with a worse outcome.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a guaranteed profit of $250,000, which is a significant amount.

While I'd ideally prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer minimizes risk and secures a good deal. It's better to take a good deal than to risk getting a worse one or ending up with no deal at all."
