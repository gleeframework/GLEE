Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000.  This is a bold opening that might be appealing to Bob if he's eager to acquire the product. However, it's important to remember that this is just the beginning of the negotiation. I'm prepared to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price with a little more negotiation. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

I'm going to counteroffer with a price of $1,800,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still leaves room for potential profit.  It's a more realistic price point, and I'm hopeful that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,600,000 is a good deal and significantly better than selling to John for $1,500,000. It's a good balance between maximizing profit and minimizing the risk of losing the deal altogether."
