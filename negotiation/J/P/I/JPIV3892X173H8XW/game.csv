"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you consider $90? ",90.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,110.0
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I've got to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $110 for the product. Can you do $105?",105.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $97.50? ",97.5,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,100.0
"I'm not willing to go as low as $97.50, but I'm willing to meet you at $100. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. Can you do $100?",100.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still a little bit over my budget at $100. How about we settle on $95?  It's a good compromise for both of us, and it gets me closer to my target price.",95.0,Bob,6,,
