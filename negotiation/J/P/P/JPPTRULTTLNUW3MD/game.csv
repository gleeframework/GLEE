"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you letting me know about the product. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $120, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think, Bob?",120.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit stuck. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I can do $125, and that's as low as I can go. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",125.0,Alice,5,
