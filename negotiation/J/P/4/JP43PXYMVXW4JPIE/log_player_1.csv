Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000 is a good starting point.** It's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and positive.** This helps establish a good rapport with Bob.
* **The offer is clear and concise.** There's no ambiguity about the price. 

This strategy allows me to potentially earn more than the $12,000 from John, while still leaving room for a successful negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, it's still significantly lower than the initial offer I made.  I'm confident I can get a better price.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially earn a higher amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, I'm still hoping for a bit closer to my initial price. Would you consider $13,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm not simply rejecting Bob's offer outright. I'm showing flexibility by making a counteroffer.
* **Meeting halfway:**  The price of $13,750 is the midpoint between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $13,500. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive message:**  I'm maintaining a friendly tone and emphasizing a fair outcome for both parties. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while still aiming for a higher price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,500 again? It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reaching a compromise:**  Bob has stuck with his counteroffer of $13,500. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, this offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and John's offer. 
* **Avoiding further negotiation:** There's a risk of going back and forth with Bob indefinitely.  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and secures a higher price than selling to John.

This decision balances maximizing potential earnings with the risk of further negotiation."
