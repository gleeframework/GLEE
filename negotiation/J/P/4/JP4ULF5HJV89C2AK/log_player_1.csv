Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you see the value in this product, but $750,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,200,000?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it seems unlikely he'll reach $1,000,000 quickly.  John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, and at this point, the certainty is more valuable than risking further negotiation with Bob."
