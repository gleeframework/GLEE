Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with an offer closer to your minimum acceptable price ($12,000) increases the chance of a higher profit margin. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, making him feel like he's getting a better deal. 
* **Alternative Buyer Security:** You have the safety net of John, ensuring you won't be forced to accept an offer below your minimum.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how badly he might want the product."
