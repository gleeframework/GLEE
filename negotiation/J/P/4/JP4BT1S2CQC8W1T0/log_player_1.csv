Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but not so high that it's likely to scare Bob off immediately. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $60 is far too low.  While it's tempting to take it, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counteroffering with $85. This is a compromise, as it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $80, but it demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and could be more appealing to Bob than my initial offer of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $75 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $80. While I would prefer more, I'm willing to accept it at this point to avoid further negotiation and the risk of Bob walking away completely.  It's also a good opportunity to secure a sale before potentially losing out to John for only $5 more."
