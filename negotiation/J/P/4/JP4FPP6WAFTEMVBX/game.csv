"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more. How about $950,000?  That's still a significant discount from your perceived value, and it gets us closer to a deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I can't go as high as $950,000.  Would you be open to $875,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $912,500?  It's a fair meeting point, and I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal.",912500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting closer.  How about $890,000? I'm trying to be mindful of my budget.",890000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $900,000? It's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's get this done.",900000.0,Alice,7,
