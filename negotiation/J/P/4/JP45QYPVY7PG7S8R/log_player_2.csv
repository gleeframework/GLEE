"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can likely get it for closer to your $10,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $11,000 is a bit high for you.  However, $9,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $10,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's within his budget and is a good compromise.  While buying from John for $10,000 is slightly cheaper, it's not worth the risk of potentially losing the deal with Alice."
