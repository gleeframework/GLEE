"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal, you can likely get it for less.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from $150. However, I'm only willing to pay $100 for it right now.  Let me know if you're interested in that."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you showing interest. While $100 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is a good price considering you're willing to pay up to $150. Accepting this offer means you save $40 compared to buying from John, and it's still a better deal than the initial $120."
