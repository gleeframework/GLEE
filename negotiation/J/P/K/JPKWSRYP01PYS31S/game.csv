"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I know you've been looking for, and I'm confident it can help your business grow. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850000.  This price reflects its unique value and the potential it holds for your company.  Let me know your thoughts.  If this isn't the right price for you, I have another buyer ready to purchase it at $800000.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.",850000.0,Alice,1,
