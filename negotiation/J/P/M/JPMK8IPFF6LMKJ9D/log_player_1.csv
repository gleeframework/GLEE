{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit below my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping that Bob will find the offer attractive enough to accept, but if he doesn't, I can still make a counter-offer or sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $135 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $125?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

While I want to sell the product, $125 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to find a price closer to my ideal value."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $128, which is a fair price that's closer to my budget.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
