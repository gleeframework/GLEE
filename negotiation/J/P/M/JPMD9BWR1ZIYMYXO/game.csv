"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $450000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",450000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $450000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750000. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better offer elsewhere.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $750000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $550000, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial deal.",550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $550000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $700000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for both of us.",700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $700000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time I'll offer $650000. I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both of us.",650000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to find a mutually beneficial deal, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $680000. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",680000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making concessions, but $680000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make a significant compromise and offer $600000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",600000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm disappointed that we're still not close to an agreement, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $640000. This is the last concession I'm willing to make, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",640000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $640000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to make a final offer of $580000. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider purchasing the product from John for $1000000. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement before it comes to that.",580000.0,Bob,10,
