"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $92. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $88. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. ",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $88 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'll meet you at $90, and that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product offers.",90.0,Alice,5,
