"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which still offers you a good profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but I believe $1,400,000 undervalues the product's true potential. It comes with features and benefits that can significantly impact your business. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This price reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest. Let me know your thoughts.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,700,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is closer to my maximum. Let's aim for a deal that benefits us both.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
