Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and a chance for you to gain a significant advantage. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a slightly lower offer ($1,400,000) leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob, while still staying above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant advantage"" to make the offer more appealing. 

**Why not ask for the full $1,500,000?**

While tempting, it could make Bob feel like there's no room for negotiation. He might be put off and reject the offer outright, leading you to your backup plan with John. This approach balances ambition with a higher likelihood of securing a deal above your minimum price."
