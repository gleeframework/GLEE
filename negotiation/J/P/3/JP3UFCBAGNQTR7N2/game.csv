"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this.  While I agree the product is valuable, I'm thinking a price closer to $800,000 would be more in line with my budget.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  To be honest, $1,100,000 is a bit of a stretch for me right now. How about we settle at $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $950,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
