"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.**  You're only willing to spend $1,000,000. 
* **John offers a better price.** You can get the same product from John for $1,000,000.

Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the most financially advantageous decision."
