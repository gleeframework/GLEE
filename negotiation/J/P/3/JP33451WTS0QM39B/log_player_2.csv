"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $130 is a bit high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

We're starting with a counteroffer slightly above Alice's value for the product. This gives us some room to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly lower than her initial offer and John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. How about we split the difference and settle at $117? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, but we can still try to push for a better price. $117 is closer to her initial offer than our counter-offer. Let's see if she's willing to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, Alice. How about we settle at $110?"",

We're nudging the price down a bit further, aiming for a price point that's a good deal for us while still likely to be acceptable to Alice."
