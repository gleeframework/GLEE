"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm looking for a serious buyer who will appreciate its value. With that in mind, I'm willing to make a strong offer to you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase. What do you think?
