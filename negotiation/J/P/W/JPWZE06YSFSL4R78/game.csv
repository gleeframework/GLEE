"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm looking for a serious buyer who will appreciate its value. With that in mind, I'm willing to make a strong offer to you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1000000, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this counteroffer.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $750000. I appreciate your seriousness in making a deal. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $850000, which is still a great deal considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. I think this is a fair compromise and would love to hear your thoughts on this counteroffer. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1000000, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,4,
