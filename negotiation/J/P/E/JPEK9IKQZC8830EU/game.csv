"Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a very competitive price for something of this caliber.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart. That price is just not feasible for me. I'm willing to go up to $700,000, but that's my absolute limit.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I also need to be realistic about the value of this product.  Instead of just focusing on the price, how about we explore some creative financing options?  Would you be open to discussing a structured payment plan that fits your budget?",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to be flexible. However, even with a payment plan, that price is beyond what I'm able to manage.  I can offer $750,000 as my final offer. If you're not able to accept that, I'll need to explore other options.",750000.0,Bob,6,
