This offer represents a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but still allows me to make a substantial profit.  It's a good starting point for negotiations, and I can adjust my offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I will counter with a higher price, aiming for a compromise that allows me to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $1,300,000?  This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering we're getting close to the market value. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While $1,250,000 is closer to my desired range, I'm not confident we'll be able to reach a mutually agreeable price. To avoid further negotiation and potential delays, I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000, guaranteeing my minimum desired profit."
