Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $1,300,000?  This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.
