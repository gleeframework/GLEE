"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,400,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1400000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably less than Bob's perceived value of the product ($1,500,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). There's room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter-offer in hopes of reaching a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire for a competitive price.  However, my initial offer reflects the true worth of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's say $1,300,000, and we have a deal."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:** By splitting the difference between Bob's offer ($1,200,000) and my previous ask ($1,400,000), I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my target. This also maintains a strong position and signals the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, now at $1,250,000. While I could push for more, accepting this offer secures a $250,000 profit above my minimum.  It's a good balance between maximizing profit and the risk of Bob walking away if I push too hard."
