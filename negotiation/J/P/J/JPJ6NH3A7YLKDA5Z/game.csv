"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to see some more flexibility on the price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900,000 is too far below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we split the difference? I'm prepared to come down to $975,000. This price still represents a good value for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need for the product. Let me know your thoughts.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
