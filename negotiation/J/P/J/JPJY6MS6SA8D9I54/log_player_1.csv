Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value of the product, but it gives him room to negotiate.  It's also significantly below what I'm willing to sell it for to John. This strategy maximizes my chances of getting a good price from Bob while leaving open the option to sell to John if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be happy to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to sell it for to John.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $9,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $9,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000.  This is my final offer, so let me know if it works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $9,000 is a fair compromise. It's a significant improvement from his initial offer and it's still above my minimum threshold of $12,000.  Accepting his offer allows me to secure a sale without the risk of losing the deal to John."
