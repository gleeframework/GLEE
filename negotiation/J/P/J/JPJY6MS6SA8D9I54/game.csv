"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be happy to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $9,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $9,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000.  This is my final offer, so let me know if it works for you.",9000.0,Bob,4,
