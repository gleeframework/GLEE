,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1400000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1100000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This gives you a good deal while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1250000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to pay $1150000, which is closer to our desired outcome. This offer allows both of us to close the deal fairly. Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1200000? This price allows both of us to come away satisfied and finalize this deal.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
