Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1400000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1250000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to pay $1150000, which is closer to our desired outcome. This offer allows both of us to close the deal fairly. Let me know your thoughts.
