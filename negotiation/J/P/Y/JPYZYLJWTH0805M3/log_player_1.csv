Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Target Price:** I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Reasoning:**  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm taking a calculated risk.  A higher price gives me the potential to earn more, but there's a chance Bob will reject the offer.
* **Safety Net:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000, so I'm not losing money if Bob rejects. 

This offer balances the desire for a higher profit with the need to consider the possibility of Bob's rejection."
