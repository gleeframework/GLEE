You can do better than $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

You're still better off trying to negotiate a lower price.  Alice is willing to compromise, and it's possible you can get closer to your target price of $9,000."

Alice has come back to her original offer of $10,000. This is a good price for you, as it's still within your budget and saves you $2,000 compared to buying from John.  It's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate a lower price at this point, so accepting her offer is the best course of action."
