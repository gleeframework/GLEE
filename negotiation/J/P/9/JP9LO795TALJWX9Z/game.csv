"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'd find the product to be a great investment.",12000.0,Alice,3,
