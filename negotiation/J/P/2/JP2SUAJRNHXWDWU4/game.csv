"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,350,000. This price is still well below what I could get from other buyers, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
