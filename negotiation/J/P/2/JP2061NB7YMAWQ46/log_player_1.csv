Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,500,000, but I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation.  I'm aware that Bob might reject this initial offer, but I'm prepared to adjust my price based on his response and potential counteroffers. I also have the option to sell to John at any point for $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum value, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. I believe this price is still fair, considering the product's value to me, and I hope it encourages Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum value and within a reasonable range. I'm accepting his offer, as I'm confident I can't get a significantly higher price through further negotiations."
