{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $125 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that balances my desire to make a good profit while also leaving room for negotiation.  I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but below Bob's maximum value, creating a range for potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion. I am willing to pay $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, I'm not ready to sell to John just yet. I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115.  Let's see if we can find a price we're both happy with!"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am still unable to meet at $115. I am willing to pay up to $105 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still lower than what I initially hoped for, it's above my minimum acceptable price of $100 and closer to what I'm hoping for. Given that I can always sell to John for $100, accepting Bob's offer is the best course of action in this round."
