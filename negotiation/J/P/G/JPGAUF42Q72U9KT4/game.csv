"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I can do $90, which is a significant discount from my original price, but still a fair price for a great product like this.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $75?  That's a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you like the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle. I can do $85, which is a bit higher than your offer, but still a discount from my original price. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about this - I'll offer you $80 even.  It's my final offer, as I can always buy it from John for that price.  It's a fair deal and saves us both some time.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to save time, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at $80. I can do $92, which is a bit higher than your offer, but still a discount from my original price. I'm not going to go any lower than this.",92.0,Alice,7,
