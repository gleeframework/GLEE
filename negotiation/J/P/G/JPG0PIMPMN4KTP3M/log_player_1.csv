Round 2

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product is truly  higher than what you're offering.  I could come down to $14,500, which is my absolute bottom line. This is a great deal â€“ what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still unable to meet at $14,500. I remain firm at $12,000 as that aligns better with my budget. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

It's clear that Bob is unwilling to budge from his $12,000 offer.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better outcome. Accepting the guaranteed $15,000 from John is the most profitable decision at this point."
