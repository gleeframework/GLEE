"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a special price. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I will reject Alice's offer. I can get the product for $80 from John, so paying $85 to Alice is not a good deal for me.
