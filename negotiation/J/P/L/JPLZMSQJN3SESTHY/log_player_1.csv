"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, as the product is worth $10,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, $9,500 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly. "", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $9,800? I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think we can both be happy with this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired range. I'm willing to keep negotiating, hoping to get a better price, especially since John is a backup option at my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $9,800 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise: I'm willing to drop to $10,000 for a quick and final deal. This is my absolute minimum, and it's a fair price considering the product's worth. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to making a decision, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you meet me at $9,900? I think we can both be happy with this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,900 is still below my minimum price of $10,000.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that we won't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, it's wiser to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
