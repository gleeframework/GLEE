"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, my budget is limited, and I am looking for a more reasonable price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $500000.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $500000 is significantly below my initial asking price, I'm willing to come down to $1750000 to try and find common ground. This reflects the real value of the product, but still gives you a chance to make a solid investment. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is still far below what this product is truly worth. I'm willing to compromise further, but I can't go lower than $1250000. This price is fair to both of us and allows you to secure a valuable asset. Let's reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
