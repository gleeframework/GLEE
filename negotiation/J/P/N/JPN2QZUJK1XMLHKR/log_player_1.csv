Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  I'm willing to part with it for $20,000."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation is Irrelevant:** Knowing that Bob values the product at $8,000 doesn't change Alice's strategy in this scenario. This is because Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Alice should aim higher than $15,000 to maximize her potential profit. Starting at $20,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob attempts to counter-offer.
* **""Public Listing"" Tactic:**  By mentioning listing the product publicly, Alice creates a sense of urgency and potential competition, which might encourage Bob to accept the offer. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $20,000.  However, Alice is secure knowing she can sell the product to John for her minimum acceptable price."
