Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a fair offer considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, her latest offer of $850,000 is still above your maximum budget. You have the option to buy from John for $800,000, saving you $50,000. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Alice when you have a guaranteed option at your target price."
