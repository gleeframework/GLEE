"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a fair offer considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $700,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering the market value and my own budget.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
