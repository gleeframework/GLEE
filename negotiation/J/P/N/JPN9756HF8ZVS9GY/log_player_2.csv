"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a very fair price. How about $120? This is a great deal for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is offering it for $120. This is a good deal for you, as you save $30.
* Buying from John would cost you $150, which is more expensive. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option."
