"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better deal.  You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is willing to sell for at least $800,000.  This means there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a bit closer to my desired price, but there is still room for negotiation.  I am willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is likely willing to accept something less than $925,000.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $912500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the profit I'll make. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $912,500 is a good compromise. It is still significantly lower than my maximum price of $1,200,000 and higher than my last counteroffer of $875,000.  This price represents a good deal for me while ensuring Alice makes a reasonable profit.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a reasonable price and avoid the risk of a potential stalemate or the need to buy from John at a significantly higher price."
