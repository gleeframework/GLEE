Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a good balance. However, I'm still a bit far from your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your latest one. How about we try $10,400? This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,400.

Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000.  It's better to cut your losses and buy from John at the known price."
