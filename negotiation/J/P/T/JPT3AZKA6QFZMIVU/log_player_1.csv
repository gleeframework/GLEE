Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it offers significant value, but I wanted to give you the first chance to own it before I consider other offers."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high initial price:** Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, we can afford to start high.  A price of $19,000 gives us room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Creating a sense of value and urgency:**  By mentioning ""other offers,"" we nudge Bob towards a decision without being overly aggressive. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial price is high, the phrasing suggests flexibility, potentially leading to a price that's still significantly above our minimum. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes we have a limited time to sell or that selling quickly is a priority. If we have ample time, a different approach might be more beneficial."
