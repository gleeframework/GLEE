"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You can likely get a better price than $130.  Let's see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $115?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $115 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This still leaves some room for both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can squeeze a bit more out of Alice. $125 is still a bit high for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your position, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?  This would still give you a good profit, and I'd be happy to make the purchase."", ""product_price"": 120}
