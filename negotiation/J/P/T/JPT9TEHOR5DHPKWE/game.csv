"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $115?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $115 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This still leaves some room for both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?  This would still give you a good profit, and I'd be happy to make the purchase.",120.0,Bob,4,
