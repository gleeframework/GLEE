Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $115?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your position, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?  This would still give you a good profit, and I'd be happy to make the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
