"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal for something worth at least that much to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $110. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $110, it's closer to my minimum than his, and I still have time to negotiate.  I'll try to meet him halfway in my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is too low for me. How about $115? That's halfway between our initial offers and would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $112.50. Would you be willing to accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $112.5 is getting closer to my minimum, I still have some room to negotiate and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $112.50 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $113.75.  That's a fair compromise and a good price for a product you value so much."", ""product_price"": 113.75}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $113.75 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $112.25. Would you be willing to accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. Even though we're getting closer, I'm not ready to settle for a price that's so close to my minimum.  I have a few rounds left and I want to see if I can squeeze out a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I'm willing to meet you halfway once more and offer $113. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 113}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $113 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go down to $111.50. Would you be willing to accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $111.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $111.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm getting nervous about the possibility of not closing a deal. While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm worried I won't be able to get a better price in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, and I don't want to risk ending up with nothing."
