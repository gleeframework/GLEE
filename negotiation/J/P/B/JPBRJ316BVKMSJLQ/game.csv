"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $14000 for your product. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $14000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16000, considering your interest.  Let's see if we can make this work.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $15500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets us close this deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to meet me halfway.  I'm still hoping to get closer to $16000, though.  How about $15800?  It's a small difference, and it gives us both a fair deal.",15800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking to get closer to $16000, but $15800 is still a little out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $15600.  This is my final offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15600.0,Bob,6,
