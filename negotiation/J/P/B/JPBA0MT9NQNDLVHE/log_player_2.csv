"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,300,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for his maximum budget of $800,000. This is the lowest price he's willing to pay, so he's offering his best possible price upfront."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get Alice to come down further.  If Alice won't budge, buying from John at $800,000 is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now willing to pay a little more, but he's still trying to keep the price as low as possible. A counteroffer of $900,000 is a compromise, potentially appealing to Alice while still staying within Bob's acceptable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not willing to drop her price below $1,100,000.  At this point, it's better for Bob to buy from John for $800,000. He's guaranteed to get the product at his maximum budget, saving him $300,000 compared to Alice's offer."
