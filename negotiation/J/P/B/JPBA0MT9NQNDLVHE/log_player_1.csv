Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1300000} 

This offer is above Bob's valuation but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If he accepts, I get a good deal.
* **Start the negotiation:** If he rejects, it opens the door for counteroffers and potential compromise.
* **Maintain leverage:** Knowing John is willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me a strong fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price and significantly undervalues the product.  While I'd like to maximize my profits, selling to John for $1,500,000 is still a better outcome than accepting Bob's lowball offer.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value, hopefully finding a middle ground with Bob or ultimately selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still lower than my ideal price. By offering $1,000,000, I am:

* **Showing willingness to negotiate:** This indicates I am open to finding a solution that benefits both of us.
* **Bridging the gap:** The offer is halfway between Bob's initial price and my previous counteroffer, making it seem reasonable.
* **Keeping leverage:**  I'm still well above Bob's initial valuation, and I can always fall back on selling to John if Bob continues to lowball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 remains the more profitable option.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better price. I'm confident that with John's offer as a safety net, I can continue to push for a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer continues to bridge the gap between Bob's offer and my desired price point. I'm aiming for a compromise:

* **Moving closer:** $1,100,000 is a significant increase from Bob's $900,000 offer, demonstrating my flexibility.
* **Still above minimum:** It remains above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring a profitable sale for me.
* **Maintaining pressure:**  I'm not giving in to Bob's lowball tactics, but I'm also showing a willingness to find a middle ground.  

The goal is to either get Bob to accept this offer or push him to raise his counteroffer further. With John's offer as my safety net, I can afford to be patient and strategic in this negotiation."
