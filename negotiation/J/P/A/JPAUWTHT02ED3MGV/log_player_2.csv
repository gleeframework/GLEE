"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price of $1000000. It's a steal considering its true value. I'm confident you'll find it a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  While $1,000,000 is Bob's maximum, it's a good starting point to see if Alice will negotiate. There's no reason to accept the first offer, as there's potential to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product, considering its potential value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing Bob is serious about negotiating. However, it's not so low that Alice is likely to immediately reject it. 
* **Setting the Tone:** Bob's message is polite but firm, indicating he's willing to negotiate but also has a clear price point in mind.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  A counteroffer of $750,000 allows for a reasonable amount of back-and-forth before reaching Bob's maximum of $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is unfortunately too low for me. This product holds significant value, and I believe a price of $900000 better reflects its potential. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm confident this price is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's maximum, it's still too high. There's room for negotiation.  Bob should reject this offer and try to get Alice down to a price closer to his initial counteroffer of $750,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $825,000, which is closer to our target. This represents a significant step towards meeting your needs, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, bridging the gap between Bob's initial offer and Alice's latest offer.  It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while staying within a budget.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  The message is still firm, reminding Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal.
* **Setting the Stage for Agreement:**  A price of $825,000  positions Bob for a potential deal in the next round."
