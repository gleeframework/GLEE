"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. This product is valuable, and I believe we can find a compromise that benefits us both.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's continue discussing this and find a solution.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price point, but $775,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product for $800,000.  This is my absolute minimum, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",800000.0,Alice,5,
