Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this.  While I understand your perspective, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential for return on investment.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm aiming for a deal that works for both of us. To be direct, I have an offer for $1,500,000 from another buyer.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $1,350,000.  While she claims to have another buyer, it's impossible to verify. Since your absolute limit is $1,000,000 and you have a guaranteed offer from John at that price, it's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and take the sure thing."
