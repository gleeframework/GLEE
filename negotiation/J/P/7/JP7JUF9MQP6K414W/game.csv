"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value,  $1,750,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,400,000, which is still a fair price considering the value it offers.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,400,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible. To bridge the gap, I'd propose a price of $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it fairly reflects the product's value. Let's continue the conversation and see if we can finalize this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,600,000 is closer to my target, but I'm still a bit over budget. To finalize this deal, I'd need to come in at $1,550,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
