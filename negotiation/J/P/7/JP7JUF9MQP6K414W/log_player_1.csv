Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value,  $1,750,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,400,000, which is still a fair price considering the value it offers.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
