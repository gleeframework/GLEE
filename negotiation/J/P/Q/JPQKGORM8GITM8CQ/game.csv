"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet in the middle at $10,500.  This price still gives you a great deal on a valuable product, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps agree on $10,000? This would allow me to make the purchase while keeping my investment as low as possible.",10000.0,Bob,4,
