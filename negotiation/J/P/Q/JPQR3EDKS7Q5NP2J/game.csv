"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's a unique opportunity for you, and I believe it can significantly benefit your business.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me at this time.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good starting point for us to reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to our starting point, it's still below the value I need to realize. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, acknowledging the benefit this product offers you. This price reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair and reasonable offer for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to work towards an agreement. I believe this price is fair considering the value this product brings to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your commitment to finding a solution. While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below the value I need to achieve. I'm willing to consider $1,000,000 as a final compromise. This price represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's fair considering the substantial benefits this product will bring to your business.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,000,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $975,000. This shows my genuine interest in acquiring this product while staying within my financial constraints.  I believe this price strikes a good balance between our respective needs and would allow us to finalize this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  $975,000 is still a bit below where I need to be. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to accept $990,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise for both of us.  I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for your business.",990000.0,Alice,7,
