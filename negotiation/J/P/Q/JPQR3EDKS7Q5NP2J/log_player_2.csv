"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's a unique opportunity for you, and I believe it can significantly benefit your business.  I'm starting with an initial price of $1,200,000, recognizing the potential value you see in it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. You are aiming to save as much money as possible and $1,200,000 is far from your ideal price. It's best to reject and counteroffer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me at this time.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good starting point for us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to our starting point, it's still below the value I need to realize. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, acknowledging the benefit this product offers you. This price reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair and reasonable offer for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still a bit high for Bob, considering his target price is $1,500,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to drive the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to work towards an agreement. I believe this price is fair considering the value this product brings to me."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your commitment to finding a solution. While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below the value I need to achieve. I'm willing to consider $1,000,000 as a final compromise. This price represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's fair considering the substantial benefits this product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice has lowered her price, $1,000,000 is still more than Bob wants to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob wants to try to get the price down closer to his target.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to continue negotiating and try to achieve a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,000,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $975,000. This shows my genuine interest in acquiring this product while staying within my financial constraints.  I believe this price strikes a good balance between our respective needs and would allow us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  $975,000 is still a bit below where I need to be. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to accept $990,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise for both of us.  I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $990,000 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $975,000. While Bob might be able to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a significantly higher price is too high. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price that is still within his budget and significantly lower than John's offer."
