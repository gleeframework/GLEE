"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for the bare minimum just yet. I want to see if I can squeeze out a little more profit. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is still a decent profit for me and might be enough to convince Bob to come up a bit from his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,150,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000.  This is still a good profit for me, and I'm hoping that Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly more insistent on a lower price. I've already countered several times, and it's clear that we're not going to reach a deal.  I'm going to accept John's offer of $1,200,000 and sell the product to him. It's not my ideal price, but it's a guaranteed sale and better than risking a further drop in price with Bob."
