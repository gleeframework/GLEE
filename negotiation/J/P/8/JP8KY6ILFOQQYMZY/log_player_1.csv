Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175. This is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum acceptable price of $150 but leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer.  I also know I can always fall back to selling to John for $150, so I'm not under any pressure to accept a lower offer right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to sell for $140, as that's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm counteroffering at $160. This is still above my minimum price, but it's a compromise from my initial offer. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob, while still being a fair price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $145 is still too low, but I'm getting tired of this negotiation. I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  It's not my ideal price, but it's enough to cover my minimum acceptable price and avoids any further negotiation with Bob."
