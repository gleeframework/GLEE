"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price more around $12000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point. However, $12000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $15000?  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $15000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $13500? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.",13500.0,Bob,4,
