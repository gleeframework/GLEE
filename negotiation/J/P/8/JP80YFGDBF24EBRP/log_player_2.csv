"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to let it go for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. $100 is too high for you, and you can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make a profit. I can do $92 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$92 is still too high for you. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as you still have several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $92 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $88, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I still need to make a profit. I can meet you halfway, but I'll need to make a bit more. How about we meet at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is getting closer to your ideal price, you're still within your budget and have more rounds to negotiate. You can try to push for a lower price by counter-offering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still not there.  $89 is my final offer.  If you accept, we can close the deal.  If not, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 89}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $95. That's my final offer. If you're still interested, I'm willing to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $95 is still too high for you.  While you could continue to negotiate, you have limited rounds remaining, and it's likely she won't budge further.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $120, ensuring you get the product within your budget."
