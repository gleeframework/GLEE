"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product. I'm offering $1,150,000. This reflects the true value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's find common ground.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,150,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to keep negotiating. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $1,112,500?  This is a fair price that allows us both to move forward. What do you think?",1112500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer!  I can tell we're both motivated to make this work.  Would you be willing to settle at $1,090,000?",1090000.0,Bob,6,
