"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is well above my minimum of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value to Bob, hoping to encourage him to see it as a good deal.
* **Open Ended:**  I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counter-offer, which is likely to happen in a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a price of $9,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering both the value to me and the cost to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit.
* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is too low. It's only slightly above my minimum of $8,000, and I'm confident I can get a better price.
* **Negotiation:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer to continue the negotiation and try to secure a higher price. I have 8 rounds left, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm willing to be flexible to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows a willingness to compromise and might make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal.
* **Emphasis on Flexibility:** I'm emphasizing my willingness to be flexible, hoping to encourage Bob to accept this offer.
* **Still Above Minimum:** $10,500 is still significantly higher than my minimum of $8,000, which is important for maximizing my profit."
