"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering, but I am looking to keep my investment within $15000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $15000?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to keep your investment within $15000, but I'm afraid the product's value is worth more than that to me.

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're having a productive conversation. However, $18000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $20000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.",20000.0,Alice,5,
