"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $95? That way we both get a good deal.",95.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more like $85. It's a great product, but I'm on a budget. Can we meet at $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $85 is unfortunately too low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $90?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my price.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $87, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at $87?",87.0,Bob,6,
