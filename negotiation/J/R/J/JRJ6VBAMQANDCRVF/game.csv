"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you consider a price closer to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm eager to find an agreement that works for both of us, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,250,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,175,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've given this some more thought, and to be completely transparent, $1,175,000 is cutting it a little too close for me. I could consider $1,210,000, but that's really the lowest I'm willing to go. I believe this price accurately reflects the significant value this product will bring you.",1210000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close!  I can see you're firm on the value, so I'm willing to move a bit higher. How about $1,190,000 and we get this deal done?",1190000.0,Bob,6,
