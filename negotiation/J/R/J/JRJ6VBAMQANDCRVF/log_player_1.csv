"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We start with a price significantly higher than our minimum ($1,000,000) but below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a maximized profit.
* **Gauge Interest:**  The message aims to be polite and collaborative, gauging Bob's initial reaction and willingness to negotiate.
* **Alternative Option:**  We keep in mind our option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you consider a price closer to $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly lower than our initial ask and still leaves a substantial amount of potential profit on the table. We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to him, so there's room to negotiate upwards. We'll counter-offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $1,300,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm eager to find an agreement that works for both of us, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,250,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We want to signal a willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer, but not too drastically. $1,250,000 represents a compromise while still aiming for a strong profit margin.
* **Justification:**  Instead of just stating a number, we frame the counteroffer as a ""meeting halfway"" point, which can be psychologically persuasive.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** The tone remains collaborative, suggesting we're open to further discussion if Bob isn't immediately on board with this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,250,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,175,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are making progress in the negotiation, but $1,175,000 is still below our target range. We need to show Bob we are willing to walk away if we don't get a price closer to our minimum. This will encourage him to make a more serious offer in the next round.  We'll counter with a smaller concession, aiming for around $1,210,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've given this some more thought, and to be completely transparent, $1,175,000 is cutting it a little too close for me. I could consider $1,210,000, but that's really the lowest I'm willing to go. I believe this price accurately reflects the significant value this product will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1210000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We are being firm by stating our bottom line, but also fair by providing a reasonable explanation.
* **Value Emphasis:** We are reiterating the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits. 
* **Time Pressure (Subtle):** By mentioning a firm bottom line, we are subtly introducing time pressure as we only have 5 rounds left.

This approach aims to nudge Bob closer to our desired price while still leaving some room for a final round of minor adjustments if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close!  I can see you're firm on the value, so I'm willing to move a bit higher. How about $1,190,000 and we get this deal done? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,190,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Outcome:** While not our ideal price, $1,190,000 represents a significant profit of $190,000.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate risks a breakdown in the deal, especially with only four rounds remaining.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Holding out for a slightly higher price from Bob might mean losing the opportunity to sell to John if negotiations fail.

This acceptance balances risk and reward, securing a very good price without jeopardizing the entire deal."
