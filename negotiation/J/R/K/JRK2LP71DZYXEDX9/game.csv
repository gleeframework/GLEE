"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 is too far below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $160. This is still a good value for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $135. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make a deal.",135.0,Bob,4,
