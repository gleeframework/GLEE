Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $175.  Would you be interested in buying it at that price?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $175 is a reasonable starting point, considering the product's value to me.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly indicates that I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer if he's not comfortable with the initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $125 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer, potentially getting closer to my desired price.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I have John as a buyer for $150 provides a safety net in case negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 is too far below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $160. This is still a good value for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Reasonable Price:** $160 is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate while still protecting my bottom line.
* **Highlight the Value:** Emphasizing the product's value and Bob's potential satisfaction helps make the offer more appealing. 
* **Open for Further Discussion:** The message encourages Bob to counter again if needed, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $135. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $135 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **No significant progress:** Bob's counteroffers have not moved the needle much towards my desired price. 
* **John offers a better deal:** Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is more than Bob's offer and closer to my desired price.  The risk of further negotiation with Bob is not worth the potential for a lower price."
