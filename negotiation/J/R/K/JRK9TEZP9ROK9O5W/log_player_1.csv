Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he haggles you down.
* **Anchoring:** By suggesting $120, you're ""anchoring"" the price in Bob's mind. Even though the value is lower for him, the initial high price might make a lower offer seem more appealing. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have John as a backup buyer, ensuring you won't go below your minimum price. This gives you leverage in the negotiation. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. If he seems completely unwilling to meet your price, you can always adjust downwards, keeping in mind your $80 minimum."
