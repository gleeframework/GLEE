"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I'm confident this represents a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to aim for the maximum profit. 
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:**  The offer leaves some room for negotiation while staying comfortably above my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **Positive Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and inviting Bob's input. 
 
This strategy aims to gauge Bob's willingness to pay a premium while leaving options open for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,350,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is tempting, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I started high, and it's expected for him to counter lower. I'm confident I can get closer to my initial asking price, especially since we have plenty of rounds left. Selling to John is my fallback option, but I'll aim higher with Bob for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations. I'm still confident that this product offers you exceptional value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concessions:** I'm making a smaller concession in this round ($50,000) compared to Bob's previous move ($100,000). This signals that I'm willing to negotiate but am also aiming high.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** By proposing $1,400,000, I'm suggesting a price that splits the difference between our previous offers. This often feels psychologically appealing to both parties. 
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the higher price point. 
 
This approach maintains a firm stance while encouraging Bob to move closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,375,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is negotiating in smaller increments now, which suggests he's getting closer to his limit. While $1,375,000 is a good offer, I'm willing to push a bit further. I'll make a smaller concession to see if I can get him closer to $1,400,000.  I'm still comfortable rejecting his offer and continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's make this happen. How about we settle at $1,390,000? This is a strong offer reflecting the value you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1390000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:**  I'm only coming down $10,000 from my previous offer, signaling I'm nearing my bottom line.
* **Creating Urgency:** The language ""Let's make this happen"" introduces a subtle sense of urgency without being overly aggressive. 
* **Focusing on Value:** I'm emphasizing the benefits Bob will receive to reinforce the product's worth.

This counteroffer balances firmness with a desire to close the deal. It leaves room for Bob to make one final, smaller counter if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,380,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to close the deal. Here's why:

* **Strong Offer:**  $1,380,000 is a very good offer, significantly above my minimum ($1,200,000) and close to my earlier target.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob's counter-offers are getting smaller.  Continuing to negotiate might only yield a few thousand more, not worth the risk of losing the sale.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means I have the money in hand and can put it to use. The potential extra profit from more rounds isn't worth the delay. 

Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away later."
