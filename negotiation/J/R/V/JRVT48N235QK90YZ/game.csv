"Alice, thanks for the offer.  That said, I think $1,200,000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you think $1,200,000 is a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
