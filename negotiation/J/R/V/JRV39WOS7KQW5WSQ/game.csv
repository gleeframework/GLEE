"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $11,500, which I believe is a fair value considering its worth. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I do like the product, $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider something closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This price reflects the value of the product while still allowing for a reasonable profit for me.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $10,250 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and allows for a good deal for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
