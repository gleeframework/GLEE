"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $11,500, which I believe is a fair value considering its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is too high. It makes more sense to negotiate and see if you can get a price closer to your $10,000 limit before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I do like the product, $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider something closer to $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to start with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a great deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $9,000 leaves space for a compromise between your ideal price and Alice's valuation. 
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help you understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This price reflects the value of the product while still allowing for a reasonable profit for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but it's still above what John is offering.  There's room for further negotiation, and you haven't lost anything by continuing to counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $10,250 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increases:**  Instead of a large jump from your previous offer, a smaller increase to $9,500 shows willingness to move towards Alice's price while still aiming for a lower price point.
* **Signaling Seriousness:** By offering a specific price, you signal that you're serious about purchasing the product but need Alice to work with you on the price. 
* **Staying Competitive:** You're getting very close to John's price. It's strategic to keep the negotiation moving forward, but you also have a strong backup option if Alice is unwilling to budge further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and allows for a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met your target price of $10,000! There's no point in negotiating further, especially since John's offer is also $10,000.  You've successfully negotiated a good deal!"
