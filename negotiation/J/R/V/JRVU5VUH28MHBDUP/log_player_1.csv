Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?

Round 3

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground.  I can go as low as $12,500, but that's my absolute best offer. It's a fantastic deal for a product you won't regret having."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

Explanation: Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer.  It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John than to risk getting a lower offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
