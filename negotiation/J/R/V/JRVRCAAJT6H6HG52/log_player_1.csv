Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price slightly above the product's worth to Bob, aiming to get a good starting point for negotiation. I'm confident that John's offer of $1,500,000 provides a solid fallback option if Bob isn't willing to meet my initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my initial price and my minimum acceptable value.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer but still well above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable value. I'll accept this offer and avoid any further negotiation. There's no need to risk losing the deal by trying to push for a higher price, especially when I have a guaranteed fallback option with John."
