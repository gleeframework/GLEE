{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're past the halfway point in the negotiation, and Bob is still significantly below our desired price. While he's incrementally increasing his offers, we need to hold firm to get a price closer to the product's value. We'll make one more counteroffer, but we're getting close to the point where selling to John is the better option."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need you to meet me closer to my price. This offer is a significant concession on my part.  I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's time to put our foot down. We're offering to sell at our absolute minimum acceptable price. This sends a strong signal to Bob that we're serious and won't go any lower.  If he rejects this, we're better off selling to John."
