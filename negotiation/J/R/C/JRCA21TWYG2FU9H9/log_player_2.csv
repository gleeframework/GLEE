"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth buying the product from Alice at $18,000 when you can get it from John for $15,000.  Rejecting her offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer of $13,000. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation and leaves room to potentially compromise without going over my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $16,000 is closer to my maximum budget, I'm still willing to try and negotiate a lower price. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'll increase my offer to $14,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still below Alice's current offer. I believe this demonstrates a genuine attempt to negotiate a deal, but also leaves room for potential further compromise if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,500 is close to my maximum budget, I'm still hesitant to accept. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating with Alice. There's a good chance I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm raising my offer to $14,500. This is a small increase from my previous offer, showing that I'm willing to meet Alice halfway. It's also still below her current offer, demonstrating that I'm still actively negotiating for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would love to get the product for closer to my budget, Alice has lowered her offer to $15,200 which is only $200 above what I can get it for from John.  I'll accept this offer to ensure I get the product and save some time."
