"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.** You would pay $1,300,000 from Alice, which is less than the $1,500,000 you'd pay from John.
* **It's still within your budget.** Your maximum budget is $1,500,000, and Alice's offer is below that."
