Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he gets you to come down at all.
* **Justification:** Vaguely mentioning ""value"" can pique Bob's interest and make him curious about why you've priced it this way. 
* **Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quicker. 

**Important Note:** While John guarantees $15,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob if the negotiation is successful."
