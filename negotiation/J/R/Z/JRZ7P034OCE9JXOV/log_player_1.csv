I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price for the product. I'm confident Bob will find the price attractive, considering it's still below his perceived value of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of securing a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering with $8,800. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still remaining above my minimum price. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hopeful Bob will accept it."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and while I'd prefer more, it's the best I can get at this point.  I'm happy to secure this deal and avoid further negotiations."
