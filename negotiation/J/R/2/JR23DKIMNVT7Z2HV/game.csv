"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that our product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. How about we settle at $7,500?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $7,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $7,500, which would be $8,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $10,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margins.",8250.0,Alice,5,
