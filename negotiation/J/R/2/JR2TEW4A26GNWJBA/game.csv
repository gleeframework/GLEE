,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1100000. This is the best price I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a serious buyer, and I appreciate that. However, $950000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1050000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to meet your minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $980000, but no higher. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",980000.0,Bob,6,
