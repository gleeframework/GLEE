Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $1,100,000? It's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and the counteroffer.  However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value this product holds for you, $1,300,000 is a much fairer price.  Let's find a middle ground and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a budget of $1,200,000. Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget, but $1,200,000 is still quite a bit below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000 to meet you halfway. This is a great deal for you, and we can finalize the sale quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
Alice is coming down in price, and we are now very close to my ideal price. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and risking going over budget with further rounds isn't worth it."
