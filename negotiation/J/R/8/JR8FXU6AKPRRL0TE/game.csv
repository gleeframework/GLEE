"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know this product is worth significantly more to you. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $1,100,000? It's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and the counteroffer.  However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value this product holds for you, $1,300,000 is a much fairer price.  Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a budget of $1,200,000. Would you be open to that?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $1,200,000 is still quite a bit below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000 to meet you halfway. This is a great deal for you, and we can finalize the sale quickly.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
