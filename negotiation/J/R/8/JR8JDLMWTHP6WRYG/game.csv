"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'd like to start with this offer.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1,750,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my financial constraints.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
