Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me.

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
