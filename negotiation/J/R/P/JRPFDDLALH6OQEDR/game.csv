"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. I've put a lot of thought into the value of this product, and while I want to find a price we can both agree on, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",12500.0,Bob,4,
