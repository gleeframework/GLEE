**Reasoning:**

Alice is making concessions, but her price reductions are too slow. It's unlikely she'll come down to a price that's significantly closer to your $800,000 walk-away point within the remaining rounds. John offers a guaranteed price that fits your budget, making it the safest and most financially sound option."
