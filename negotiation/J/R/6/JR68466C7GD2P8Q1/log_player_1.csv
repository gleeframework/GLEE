Given its unique features and potential for your business, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial asking price is significantly higher than I had budgeted for. I'm interested in exploring a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you be open to considering a price closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, the product's inherent value and potential for generating substantial returns warrant a higher investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the adjusted offer, but that price remains outside my budget. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but I need us to find a more realistic middle ground.  Would you consider $900,000? This reflects a substantial investment on my part while acknowledging the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still far below both my minimum and the product's actual worth to him. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can push him closer to at least $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm also eager to find an agreement that works for both of us. To that end, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000. This is a significant concession on my end and reflects my commitment to making this deal happen."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a gap between us. I understand this product represents significant value, but I need to work within my budget.  How about $1,100,000?  This is a serious offer that demonstrates my strong interest in acquiring the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're finally getting into a price range that's becoming tempting, but $1,100,000 is still significantly less than I'd like to get. I think Bob might be willing to go higher, especially since he explicitly mentioned a ""budget"" -  this might be a tactic. I'll push a little further, but I'll be prepared to accept if he comes up significantly in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we are getting closer.  I appreciate you working with me on this.  To bridge the remaining gap, I'm proposing a final offer of $1,350,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, as it represents a substantial compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's significant worth. "",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm making it clear this is my final offer to signal I'm not willing to go much lower. This puts the pressure on Bob to either accept a price significantly higher than he's offered or risk losing the deal.  The price is still above my absolute minimum, allowing me a small buffer if he pushes back slightly."
