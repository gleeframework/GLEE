"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm intrigued by the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. $12500 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. It's a fair price considering what I'm willing to spend, and I'm confident it's a good value for you as well.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. I'm offering the product to you for $12500, and I'm willing to throw in some additional value - I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $1000. Is this a more attractive offer for you?",12500.0,Alice,5,
