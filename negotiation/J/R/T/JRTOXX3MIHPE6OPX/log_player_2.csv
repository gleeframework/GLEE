(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1050000. What do you think?

**Explanation:**

Bob should still reject Alice's offer.  While it's better than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price and he can likely get closer to his goal with another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'll give you one more chance to meet me in the middle. I'll counteroffer at $1075000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer. 

* **It's a good deal for Bob:**  $1,075,000 is significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000.
* **Alice's final offer:** Alice has indicated this is her final offer, meaning further negotiation is unlikely to yield a lower price. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If Bob rejects, Alice might walk away, and Bob would be left with only John's higher price.

While Bob might prefer a lower price, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice based on the information provided."
