"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [product name] for $15,000. This is a great deal considering the value it offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as a positive opportunity for Bob, highlighting the value of the product. 
* **Open-ended question:** I'm inviting Bob to engage in the conversation by asking for his thoughts.

This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it just yet. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'm confident I can convince Bob to pay a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest, $9,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $12,000 to show you my commitment to making this work. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-argument:**  I acknowledge Bob's offer but reiterate that $9,000 undervalues the product.
* **Compromise:**  I offer a counter-price ($12,000) that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Positive framing:**  I emphasize my commitment to reaching a deal and encourage further negotiation.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and encourage Bob to raise his offer while still showing flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $12000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is exactly what I'd get from John. While I'd prefer to earn more, securing the deal with Bob and avoiding any further negotiation rounds is the most efficient option at this point."
