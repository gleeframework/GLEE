"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest, $9000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $12000 to show you my commitment to making this work. Let's meet in the middle.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $12000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
