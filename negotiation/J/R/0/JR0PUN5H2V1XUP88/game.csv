"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I can meet you halfway at $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000. I'm still a little high, but I'm willing to go up to $13,500.  Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $13,500, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above your budget. I can try to meet you in the middle again, but this time at $14,500. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping for a price closer to my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $14,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500, but I need to get closer to my target price. I can offer it to you for $15,200. This is my final offer, so I hope you can consider it.",15200.0,Alice,7,
