"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth exploring negotiation to see if a better price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I can meet you halfway at $16,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price. Bob can still try to negotiate further to get closer to his target of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000. I'm still a little high, but I'm willing to go up to $13,500.  Is that something you'd be willing to consider?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to go up to $13,500, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above your budget. I can try to meet you in the middle again, but this time at $14,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still a bit more than he's willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get a better deal by continuing to counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping for a price closer to my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $14,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500, but I need to get closer to my target price. I can offer it to you for $15,200. This is my final offer, so I hope you can consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,200 is still above Bob's budget, and while there are a few rounds left, it's unlikely Alice will come down to his target price of $12,000. It's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product from John at the guaranteed price of $12,000.  This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
