,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a little, how about $10,500? This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can't go any lower than $10,125.  It's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10125.0,Alice,5,
