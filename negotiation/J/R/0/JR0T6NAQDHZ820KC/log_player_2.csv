Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a little, how about $10,500? This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can't go any lower than $10,125.  It's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Alice is very slowly coming down on her price, and it's unlikely she'll meet the $10,000 target. It's better to cut your losses and buy from John at this point."
