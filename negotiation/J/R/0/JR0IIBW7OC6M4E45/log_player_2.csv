"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable item, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its worth. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,000,000, and I'm offering you a discount. If you're interested, let me know, and we can discuss the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is offering a discount, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's better to reject her offer and purchase the product from John for a price within your limit."
