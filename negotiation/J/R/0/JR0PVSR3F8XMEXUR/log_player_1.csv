I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate."

While I'm happy with $15,000, I want to see if I can get a bit more. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

I'm dropping the price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a profit above my minimum."

I'm not willing to go below $15,000 yet. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is getting increasingly unwilling to meet my price.  I've already gone down quite a bit, and I'm not sure if he'll budge further. To avoid the risk of getting stuck with a lower price, I'll sell the product to John for my minimum acceptable price."
