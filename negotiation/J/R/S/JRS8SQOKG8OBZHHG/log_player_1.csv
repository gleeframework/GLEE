{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and emphasizing the value to Bob. I'm also leaving the door open for counteroffers.

**Strategy:**

* This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. 
* If Bob rejects, I can either counteroffer or move on to John, depending on how confident I am in getting a better deal with Bob. 
* By starting with a slightly higher price, I aim to maximize my profit while also keeping the negotiation open."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $900,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's offer:** Although $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price point.
* **Proceed to the next round:**  I'm confident that I can get a better offer from Bob or John. 
* **Reasoning:** I have a high minimum value, and I know I can sell to John for $1,200,000. I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob. It's likely that I will propose a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, keeping the negotiation moving in a direction that benefits me."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about $950,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and is still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm increasing the price slightly to $950,000. This demonstrates that I'm open to negotiation but also that I'm not willing to settle for a price too far below my desired range. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while reaffirming my own value proposition. I'm also using a conciliatory tone, emphasizing ""finding common ground"" to encourage further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer maintains momentum in the negotiation.
* It allows me to test the waters and see if Bob is willing to compromise further.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to either counter again or move on to John, depending on my assessment of the situation."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $920,000. Can you consider this price?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's offer:** While $920,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I believe I can get a better price through continued negotiation. 
* **Proceed to the next round:** I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my desired value.  I'm confident I can secure a more favorable deal with either Bob or John.
* **Reasoning:** I'm aware that I can sell to John for $1,200,000, providing me with a strong backup option.  This allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our current offers while still remaining within my acceptable price range. I'll carefully consider the risk of losing Bob as a buyer versus the potential of securing a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $935,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 935000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing a price of $935,000, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $950,000 and Bob's current offer of $920,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing fairness and compromise in my message. I'm also using a positive and encouraging tone to increase the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer.

**Strategy:**

* By proposing a ""split the difference"" offer, I'm showing a genuine desire to reach an agreement. This can increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to make a final counteroffer or move on to John. I'm aware that I'm approaching the lower end of my acceptable price range, so my next move will be carefully considered."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Sell to John:**  I've reached the point where I'm not comfortable accepting Bob's offer of $915,000. This price is too close to my minimum acceptable value, and I'm not confident that I can achieve a better price with further negotiations.
* **Reasoning:** I have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer.  There's no reason to risk losing this opportunity for a marginal increase in price from Bob.

**Strategy:**

* This decision is based on maximizing my potential profit.  I'm willing to forgo a negotiation with Bob that might be time-consuming and ultimately unproductive. 
* By selling to John, I guarantee a significant profit and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiations."
