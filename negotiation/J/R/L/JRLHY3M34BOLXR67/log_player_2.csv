"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's valued at $120 by us due to its high quality and unique features. Given your interest and assessment of its value at $80, I propose we meet in the middle. How about an offer of $95? I believe this price reflects both our perspectives and could be beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
