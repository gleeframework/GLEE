Given your interest and assessment of its value at $80, I propose we meet in the middle. How about an offer of $95? I believe this price reflects both our perspectives and could be beneficial for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given your value of $120 and my value of $80, I'm willing to go up to $85.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
