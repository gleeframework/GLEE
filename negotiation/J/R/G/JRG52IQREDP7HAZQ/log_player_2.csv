"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true value.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget. It's a good starting point to negotiate, but it's unlikely you'll get a good deal accepting it.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially save a lot of money."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I understand your offer, the $800,000 price point doesn't reflect its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
