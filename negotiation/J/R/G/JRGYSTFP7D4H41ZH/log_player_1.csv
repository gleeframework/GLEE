{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I believe it holds significant potential for your business, and I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. My initial offer is $1,200,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price.  $1,000,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  My counteroffer is $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good price point. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm starting to feel the pressure to make a decision.  I don't want to risk losing Bob entirely, so I'm going to accept his offer.  $1,050,000 is better than selling to John for $800,000."
