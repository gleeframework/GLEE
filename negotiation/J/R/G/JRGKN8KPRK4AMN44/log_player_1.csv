Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has great potential, that initial price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $1,125,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,125,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. Let's meet closer to the middle â€“ how about $1,850,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate you moving towards a middle ground.  How about $1,387,500?  I think that's a fair offer, reflecting both the value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,387,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,387,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly below our minimum acceptable price. While Bob is moving closer, accepting now would leave a lot of money on the table. We have room to negotiate further and see if we can get closer to $1.5 million."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting tough! You drive a hard bargain. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit more, but $1,625,000 is still a touch high for me. How about we split the difference and land at $1,500,000? That's my best and final offer.
