While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still over his limit. He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a price closer to his $12,000 target."

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000. While Alice has come down in price, $14,500 is still over Bob's budget.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to take the guaranteed deal from John and avoid further negotiation."
