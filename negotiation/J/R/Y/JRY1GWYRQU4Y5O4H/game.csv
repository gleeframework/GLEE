"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but that price is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  How about we split the difference and settle on $14,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $17,000 for the product. I can meet you at $15,500, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
