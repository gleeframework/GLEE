"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $12,000.  It's not even close to the value you place on the product.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $16000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $12000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $16,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my budget of $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. I'm willing to go up a little bit, but I'm not willing to pay more than $12,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $14000, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $16500.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,500 is still above my budget of $12,000.  I've already made two counteroffers, and it's clear that Alice is not willing to come down to my desired price. It's better to cut my losses and purchase the product from John for $12,000. This ensures I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with and avoids further negotiations."
