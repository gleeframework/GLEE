"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to sell, $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product, which is its worth to me. This price reflects a fair value based on its market price and my budget. Let me know if you're open to this offer.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $14000, which is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the current market conditions.  I hope you'll consider this final offer.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $14000, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $16500. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",16500.0,Alice,5,
