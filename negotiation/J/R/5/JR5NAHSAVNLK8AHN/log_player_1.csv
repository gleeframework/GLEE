Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, it's always best to try for a higher profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with a price slightly below your minimum acceptable price ($150) creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this offer doesn't explicitly invite negotiation, it leaves you room to potentially lower the price slightly if Bob hesitates, without going below your minimum. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making a sale."
