"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for this product. Let's see if we can work something out.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can see the value of this product is worth more than that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $16000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $16000 is still too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12000? I think that's a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm not comfortable with $12000. I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on the price, but I'm still not there yet.  Would you be willing to come down to $13000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at that price.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $13500. That's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $13500. How about we settle on $13000?  This is a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal.",13000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already met you at $13500, and now you're asking me to go back to $13000? I'm not comfortable with that. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but it's going to be a tough one. I'll meet you at $14000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,9,
