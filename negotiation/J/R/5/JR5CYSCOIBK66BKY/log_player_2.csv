Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can see the value of this product is worth more than that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $16000. What do you think?

# Alice's message: I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm not comfortable with $12000. I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $14000. What do you think?

Alice is not budging on the price, and you're running out of time.  You've already gone back and forth multiple times, and it's likely that Alice won't budge any further.  To save time and money, it's best to buy the product from John for $8,000."
