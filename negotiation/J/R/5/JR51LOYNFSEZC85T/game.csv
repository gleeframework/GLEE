"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  How about $10,500? I'm still very interested in the product, but that's the best I can do right now.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to save a bit more, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11,200. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $11,200 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $10,800? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this deal.",10800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to save a bit more, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,800. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $11,400. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",11400.0,Alice,5,
