"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1300000. How about we meet in the middle at $1350000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1350000. How about we try $1275000? This is my final offer.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $1275000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I'm hoping we can finalize a deal.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
