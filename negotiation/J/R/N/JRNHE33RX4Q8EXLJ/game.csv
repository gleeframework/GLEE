"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000. Would that work for you?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $16,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider something closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  While I can't go as low as $10,000, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
