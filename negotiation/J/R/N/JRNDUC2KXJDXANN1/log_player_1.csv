{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum value, giving me some room to negotiate.  I'll see if Bob is willing to bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $80.  I'm going to counteroffer Bob, hoping to find a price we can both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, appreciate your interest! While I'm willing to negotiate, $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go for $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we try $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm still hoping for a better price, it seems like Bob isn't willing to go much higher.  I'm confident that I can get at least $80 from John, so that's what I'll do."
