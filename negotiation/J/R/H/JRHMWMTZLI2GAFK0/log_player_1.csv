Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer aims to strike a balance. It's significantly higher than my minimum price of $8,000, giving me a good profit. It's also below Bob's estimated value, leaving room for potential negotiation.  If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy."
