"Alice,  while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  Considering my maximum is $800,000, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price, given the value I place on the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand your position, $1,075,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
