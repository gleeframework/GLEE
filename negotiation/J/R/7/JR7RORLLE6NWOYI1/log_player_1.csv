Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,000. Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room for negotiation above your minimum price.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $8,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less from Bob. 
* **Splitting the Difference:** Aiming for a price around $12,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still offering Bob a deal that's beneficial for him.

**Important:** This is just one possible strategy. You could start with a higher offer and be willing to negotiate down, or you could offer a price closer to Bob's valuation if you believe he's particularly eager to buy."
