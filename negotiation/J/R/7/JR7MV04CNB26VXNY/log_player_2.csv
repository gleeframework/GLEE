"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
Let's try to get a better price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

This counteroffer aims to bring the price closer to my budget while still leaving room for further negotiation. It also maintains a polite and interested tone to encourage Alice to continue the discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $70 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $80?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice meeting you at $80 makes this a good deal. It hits your maximum budget, and there's no guarantee you could negotiate further down. Accepting now secures the product at your target price."
