Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing further."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the opportunity to purchase this product. I understand its value, but I would like to propose a more reasonable price of $800,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to move down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair offer considering its unique value proposition."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the product's value, I still feel that $1,300,000 is too high. My counteroffer is $1,100,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 
 
While I could push for more, accepting $1,100,000 is a significant profit. It's a good balance between maximizing my earnings and securing the sale quickly. Holding out for a higher offer from Bob risks losing his interest, and John's offer is less appealing at this point."
