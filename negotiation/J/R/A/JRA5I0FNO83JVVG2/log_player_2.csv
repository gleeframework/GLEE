"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $15,000. I believe it offers significant value, even exceeding the price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,000."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we're serious buyers but not willing to overpay. 
* **Anchoring:** By putting $8,000 on the table, we're trying to anchor the negotiation closer to our desired price range. 

It's a balancing act. We don't want to lowball so much that Alice walks away, but we need to push for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $15,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  Even though Alice came down, $13,000 is still more than you want to spend.
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Be wary of ""final offer"" statements. It's often a negotiation tactic. 
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup option with John at $10,000, which gives you leverage.

It's worth seeing if Alice will negotiate further. If not, you can always go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but I have a firm budget.  Would you consider $9,500? I'm hoping we can find a middle ground."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** Alice moved down $2,000, we're moving up $1,500. This shows willingness to compromise but holds firm on the budget.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By suggesting a specific price, we're encouraging a quicker resolution.
* **Alternative in Mind:**  We're still below John's $10,000 offer, keeping that as a fallback."
