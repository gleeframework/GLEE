"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I think it would be very valuable to you.  I'm asking for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price close to Alice's value of $8,000. This offer gives Alice some room to negotiate but still leaves Bob with a significant saving compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob.  I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,250 is a good deal for Bob. It's still significantly lower than John's price of $12,000 and gives Bob a considerable saving.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting a lower offer and potentially losing the deal to John is high. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
