"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it allows room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,800,000 is a good price, I'm still holding out for more. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm coming down slightly from my initial offer, but I'm still holding firm at a price that's higher than Bob's offer. I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while also maintaining a high price point."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a bit more. While $1,750,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm confident that I can secure a higher price, especially since I have several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000}
```

I'm reducing my offer again, but only slightly.  I'm trying to signal to Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I'm not desperate to sell at his price.  He's now just $100,000 away from my minimum. I'm hoping this will encourage him to make a final counteroffer that gets us to a successful conclusion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,725,000 is getting close to my minimum, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a bit closer to my desired price. I'm confident in the value of the product and I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1775000}
```

I'm coming down to $1,775,000. This is only $50,000 away from Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this shows my willingness to compromise and encourages him to meet me halfway.  With only 3 rounds left, I want to make sure we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'm still disappointed that Bob hasn't met my minimum asking price, with only two rounds remaining, it's not worth risking another round to potentially get a better offer.  $1,700,000 is a significant amount of money, and I'm happy to secure this deal. It's important to be realistic and acknowledge when it's time to close a deal, even if it's not at the exact price I originally hoped for."
