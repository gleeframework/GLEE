"Alice, while I understand the value of your product, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my needs and the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to my original asking price.  How about $1,050,000?  This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a fair price given the value of the product. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's meet in the middle at $975,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve our goals.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,012,500?  This would be a fair compromise, and we could finalize the deal.  Let's make this happen.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
