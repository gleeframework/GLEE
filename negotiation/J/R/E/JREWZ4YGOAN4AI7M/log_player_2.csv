"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject the offer. $1,200,000 is above his budget, and he has 9 rounds to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I understand the value of your product, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my needs and the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to my original asking price.  How about $1,050,000?  This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a fair price given the value of the product. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. Bob has more rounds to negotiate and should continue to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's meet in the middle at $975,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve our goals."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,012,500?  This would be a fair compromise, and we could finalize the deal.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,012,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has been trying to negotiate a lower price, but Alice is proving stubborn.  He's down to his last 5 rounds and the offer is still above his ideal price point.  He's better off buying from John at this point to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
