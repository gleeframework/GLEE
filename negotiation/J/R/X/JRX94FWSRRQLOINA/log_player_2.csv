# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and also less than buying from John. Accepting her offer saves you money."
