"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good deal. Since I know Bob values the product at $15,000, he should be willing to negotiate down from this price.  I'm leaving some room for negotiation, but also ensuring I get a price significantly above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum but still lower than what I'd like to achieve. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13800}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,800. This is a small increase from Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a price closer to my initial goal. It also keeps the negotiation moving forward without risking a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still aiming for a better price.  I'll reject Bob's offer again, but I'm getting closer to my minimum.  I'll need to be careful in the next round to avoid going too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway at $13,500.  This is a fair compromise considering the previous offers and my desire to close the deal. If he rejects this, I may have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $13,000 is only $1000 less than my initial offer and is quite close to my minimum.  With only 4 rounds left, I'm concerned about the risk of further negotiations failing and having to sell to John for a significantly lower price. I'll accept Bob's offer to secure a good deal."
