"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at such a reasonable price. However, I am hoping to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $1050000? I believe this would still be a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand your desire to maintain a profit, I'm still aiming to keep my expenses as low as possible.

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1080000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer the product to you for $1080000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
