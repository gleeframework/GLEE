"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's desired price of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000 on this product. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money and $10,800 is still above his desired price of $10,000.  He's not yet at the point of needing to buy from John, so he should continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still trying to stay within my budget and can't go higher than $10,600. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?"", ""product_price"": 10600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as high as $10,600. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,700. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. He has already saved $300 off the initial offer and while $10,700 is a tempting price, it's still not the best possible deal. It's worth one more round of negotiation to see if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $10,650. That seems like a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'll be happy with this purchase.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10650}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as high as $10,650. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,600. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has saved $400 off the initial price, but there's not much room for further negotiation with Alice. He's only $600 away from his target price of $10,000.  It's now more beneficial for Bob to buy from John and secure the product at his desired price.  There's a risk that Alice will reject his next counteroffer and he'll be left with no deal. Buying from John guarantees he gets the product at his target price."
