"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation, and hopefully, it will entice Bob to make a counteroffer.  I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,500,000, and I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob if I continue to negotiate.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price point for Bob, and that we can reach a mutually agreeable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
``` 

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $1,600,000. This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges Bob's willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum value. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground that leads to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied. There's a good chance he's willing to go a little higher, especially as we are nearing the halfway point of our rounds. I will counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
``` 

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise, and only $50,000 away from my minimum value. I'm hoping this will be a convincing enough offer for Bob to accept. If he doesn't, I might have to consider selling to John at $1,500,000 in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds remaining, and Bob still unwilling to meet my minimum value, I believe it's time to cut my losses and sell to John. While I would have preferred a higher price, securing a sale at $1,500,000 guarantees I get my desired minimum value. Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks running out of rounds and ending up with a lower price, or even no sale at all."
