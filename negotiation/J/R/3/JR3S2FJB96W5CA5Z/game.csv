"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $115 for it, what do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for offering, Alice! I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, $90 might be a big jump. How about $95? That's a fair price and shows I'm serious about buying.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get a good price, but $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
