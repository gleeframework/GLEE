Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  Even though it's slightly above his ideal price, it's still within his budget.  Further negotiation could lead to a lower price, but there's a risk Alice will reject his next counteroffer and he'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  It's a good deal considering his budget and the ongoing negotiation."
