"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my limitations and the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $925,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go to $900,000. This represents a significant step for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",900000.0,Bob,4,
