"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant investment for you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $12,000. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product but $12,000 is a little high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. How about we discuss a price of $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $11,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to do $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final concession, so I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at this point.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is very close, but I need to stay closer to $10,000. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,250? It seems like a fair compromise for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already offered you $10,500, and I'm not willing to go back to $10,250. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems we are getting stuck on this. To move things along, I'm willing to raise my offer to $10,350. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects my strong interest in the product while respecting your need for a fair price. ",10350.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $10,350 is enough. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,9,
