Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:**  Offering the product at $140 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Close to John's Price:**  While you have a guaranteed sale with John, it's always better to try for a higher profit. $140 is a good balance between maximizing profit and not scaring Bob away with a price too close to your minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:**  By mentioning ""value,"" you subtly nudge Bob to think beyond just the price and consider the product's benefits."
