"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,050,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. This reflects my best judgement of its true worth and allows us both to benefit.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down from $1,150,000, but $1,125,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,087,500. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget.",1087500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,100,000?  This is a significant investment for you, and I want to ensure it feels like a fair deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $1,075,000, but I think we can do better than that. How about $1,075,000, and we can discuss additional concessions on the deal?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product is undeniable.  I'm willing to hold firm at $1,100,000.  I'm confident that once you see the returns, you'll agree it was a wise investment.  Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is the right price. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,050,000, and I'm willing to throw in some additional concessions to sweeten the deal. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
