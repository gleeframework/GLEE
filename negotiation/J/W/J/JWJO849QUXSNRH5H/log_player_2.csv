"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth $1000000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  I'm starting with a price of $1200000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget. It's worth negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is more than I'm willing to pay.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to offer $900,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still higher than my maximum budget. This signals that I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm willing to negotiate.  By offering $900,000, I'm creating some room for compromise and hoping to find a deal within the first few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1050000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it gives us both room to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This price is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away with a reasonable deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but it's still within my maximum budget. I'm trying to signal that I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be enough to persuade Alice to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm determined to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which is my absolute minimum.  This price is still very fair, given the product's value to you. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at my maximum budget. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I can get a lower price, and we're already halfway through the allotted rounds. Given the opportunity to buy from John at the same price, it's a safer and more efficient option to avoid further negotiation and finalize the purchase with John."
