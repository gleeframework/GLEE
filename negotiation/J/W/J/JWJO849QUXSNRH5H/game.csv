"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth $1000000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  I'm starting with a price of $1200000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1200000 is more than I'm willing to pay.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to offer $900000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1050000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it gives us both room to make a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950000.  This price is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away with a reasonable deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm determined to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which is my absolute minimum.  This price is still very fair, given the product's value to you. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
