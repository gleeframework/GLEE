Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I know you'll find incredible value in.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can go from there."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, Bob's valuation of $1,500,000 presents an opportunity for a much higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves a significant portion of the potential profit ($150,000) on the table for Bob. This makes the offer very enticing to him.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he wants a slightly better deal, keeping the negotiation open.

By starting with a strong but not overly aggressive offer, I increase my chances of securing a deal with Bob that's significantly more profitable than my fallback option with John."
