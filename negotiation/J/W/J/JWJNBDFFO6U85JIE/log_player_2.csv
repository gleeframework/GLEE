# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad you think it's interesting to you. However, I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I can see you're serious about the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to consider other options.

Alice is stuck at $1,200,000, and it seems unlikely she'll go much lower.  It's time to cut negotiations and go with John."
