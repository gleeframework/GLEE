Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good price, Alice, but I'm really close to walking away. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to compromise further, I'll have to consider other options.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is below my ideal price, it's getting close enough to warrant serious consideration. Here's why I'd accept at this point:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might only yield small increments above $975,000.  
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means I have the capital sooner, which I can potentially reinvest. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Bob is signaling he might walk away. Pushing further risks losing him entirely.

A $975,000 sale isn't ideal, but it's a solid return and avoids the potential downsides of prolonging the negotiation."
