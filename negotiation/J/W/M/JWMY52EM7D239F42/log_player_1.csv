"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $9,000.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $7,500 for it. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $8,000 to Alice. Selling it to John for $8,000 would be a safe bet, but there's still room to negotiate with Bob.  By rejecting Bob's offer, Alice keeps the negotiation open and can potentially get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $8,250?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives you a great opportunity to acquire it."", ""product_price"": 8250}
