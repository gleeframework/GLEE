"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a good starting point to see if he's willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject it. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm dropping the price a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price higher than Bob's offer.  We're getting closer to a deal, and this counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my target price, and it's definitely better than selling to John. I'm going to accept his offer to secure the deal and avoid further negotiations."
