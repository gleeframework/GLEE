"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. This should give me a good starting point while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $100 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum price.  I'm going to try to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is still a little too low for me. How about $95? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  It seems like we are getting closer.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$90 is a good price.  It's above my minimum, and while I'd love to get closer to my ideal price, it's likely that Bob won't budge further. It's better to secure a deal than risk losing out on a sale and having to sell to John."
