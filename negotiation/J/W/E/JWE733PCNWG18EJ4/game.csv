"Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1250000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1250000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1100000. What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1200000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $1180000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1180000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you have a price in mind, but I'm still not able to go higher than $1100000. It's a fair offer considering the product's value, and it's the maximum I'm able to spend.  I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,6,
