"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1250000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,250,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you are comfortable paying. Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to counter again and potentially reach a price you're happy with."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1200000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $1180000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is getting closer to your preferred price, but $1,180,000 is still outside your comfort zone. Rejecting this offer will give you a chance to counter again and see if you can push for a lower price. You can also consider the possibility of buying from John if Alice doesn't budge."
