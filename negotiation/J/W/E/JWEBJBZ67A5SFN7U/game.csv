"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while still getting a good price for the product. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. After re-evaluating the market value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $950,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's meet in the middle.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $925,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I'm getting a reasonable return on my investment. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm offering the product to you for $920,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,7,
