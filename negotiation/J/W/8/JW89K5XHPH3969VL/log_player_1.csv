Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob will be willing to pay a bit more than my minimum, as the product is worth $15,000 to him. This strategy allows for potential profit while leaving room for a counteroffer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.  I will reject his offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $11,000. This is still a good price for Bob, as it's below the value he places on the product, and it's closer to my initial offer.  It also allows for potential negotiation in the next round if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still going to reject it. There's still some room for negotiation, and I'd prefer to push for a higher price. I'm also not yet at a point where selling to John is a better option.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $10,500.  This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's last offer, but still gives me a profit above my minimum.  It also leaves room for a final round of negotiation if necessary.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely accept his next counteroffer, as $9,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure if I can get him to budge any higher.  To avoid potentially going back and forth for a long time, I'll accept his offer and sell the product."
