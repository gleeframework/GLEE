"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to sell it to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John at $15,000. There's a chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice or find a slightly better deal elsewhere since you're willing to spend up to $15,000."
