"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to start our negotiation. I believe my product is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of starting at $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's initial offer is $1,000,000, which is above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.
*  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start a counteroffer negotiation, potentially leading to a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I recognize the value of your product, $1,000,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. How about $875,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* While Alice's offer of $875,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.
* Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate and can likely get the price down further.
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially close the deal at a price closer to his desired $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $825,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. I believe this offer is reasonable and a good starting point for a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll compromise a bit more. How about $850,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $850,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, but it's still higher than Bob's ideal price of $800,000.
*  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will not come down further.
*  Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at his maximum budget, avoiding any further negotiation and potential for a deal to fall through."
