"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay a maximum of $12,000, and her initial offer is close to that. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the first offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This establishes a strong negotiating position and shows I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  $8,500 is still above Alice's minimum acceptable price, allowing for potential negotiation in future rounds. 
* **Staying within my budget:** This offer is comfortably below my maximum price of $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's slightly lower than her initial offer, it's still above my target price.
* **There's still potential to get a better deal.** I have 7 rounds left, and Alice has already shown a willingness to negotiate. 
* **John's offer is a fallback option.** I'm not desperate to buy from Alice.  John's offer is a safety net if the negotiation falls apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Alice's offer:** My previous offer was too low, and Alice rejected it. This time, I'm increasing my offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Still below my target:** $9,000 is significantly lower than my maximum price of $12,000. This gives me room to potentially increase my offer if necessary.
* **Testing the waters:** This offer is a good test to see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway. If she rejects it, I may need to raise my offer again in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she's been decreasing her offers, $10,200 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.
* **We're close to a deal.** I'm confident I can get Alice to accept a lower price.  
* **John is still a backup.** I'm not desperate, and John's offer provides a safety net if things don't work out with Alice.  I can always buy from John if I need to."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Alice halfway:**  Alice has lowered her price, and I'm willing to raise mine to show I'm serious about making a deal. 
* **Reaching a compromise:** $9,500 represents a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's current offer.
* **Keeping pressure on Alice:**  By staying below her current offer, I'm pushing for a further reduction and demonstrating that I'm not ready to pay her full asking price yet."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is not being flexible.**  While she's reduced her offer, it's still higher than my desired price.
* **We're running out of time.** We only have 3 rounds left. It's crucial to keep negotiating. 
* **John is still a good option.** Even if negotiations fail, I can still purchase from John. 
* **I'm confident I can get a better deal.** I'll try to push Alice further in the next round."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:**  With only two rounds remaining, it's time to make a strong final offer. 
* **Meeting halfway again:** This offer splits the difference between my previous offer and Alice's current offer.
* **High-risk, high-reward:**  This is a risky offer, but it's a last chance to get a good deal.  If Alice rejects this, I'll likely have to buy from John. 
* **Knowing Alice's limits:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, so there's still a chance she might accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **We're at the final round.**  There's no time left for further negotiation.
* **Alice's offer is still too high.** It's not a deal that saves me enough money compared to my target price.
* **John's offer is the best option.** While I'm not thrilled with his price, it's the most sensible choice. Buying from John guarantees I get the product and avoids risking a complete breakdown in negotiations with Alice."
