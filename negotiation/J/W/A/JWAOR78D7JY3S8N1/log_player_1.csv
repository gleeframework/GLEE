"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for negotiation and establishes my desired price point.  I'm confident I can get a higher price than John's offer, but I'm not afraid to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, but it's a good starting point for further negotiation. I'm not willing to sell for that price yet, but I'm also not ready to walk away. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm countering with $1,500,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, as it's the price John is offering.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, but I'm getting closer to that point. I'll counter again, but I'm willing to lower my price slightly to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,350,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still confident in the value of my product. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and be willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm starting to feel the pressure, I'm not going to sell below my minimum price yet.  I'm hoping to get closer to $1,350,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only by $50,000. This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving in to Bob's lowball offers. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit.  Bob is clearly unwilling to meet me halfway, and I'm running out of time.  While I'd prefer to get a better price, John's offer is a secure and acceptable outcome. I will take the guaranteed $1,500,000."
