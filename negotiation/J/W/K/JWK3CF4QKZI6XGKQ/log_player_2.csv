Round 2

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While I can't accept your current offer, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product and still allows for a reasonable profit for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900,000 is a good offer, but I need to secure a price closer to $950,000 to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. Let's see if we can finalise this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. This is a good compromise that is within his budget and allows him to save some money compared to buying from John. Continuing to negotiate might risk Alice backing out or going back to her initial price, so it's a good time to take the deal."
