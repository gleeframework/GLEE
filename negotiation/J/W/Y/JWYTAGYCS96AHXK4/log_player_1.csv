Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm happy to discuss a price that benefits us both. How about we start the conversation at $1,100,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting high allows room for negotiation while aiming to secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, leading to a potential agreement above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** The tone is confident, highlighting the product's value to Bob, but not overly aggressive. Aiming for a win-win situation is more likely to lead to a successful sale.
* **Backup Option:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John if Bob declines, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer."
