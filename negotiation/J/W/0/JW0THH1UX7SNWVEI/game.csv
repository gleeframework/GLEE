"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $825,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being more competitive than my initial offer. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $825,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $750,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering your persistence and the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, as it's already below my initial asking price. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
