{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential return on investment for you. Let me know your thoughts, and we can move forward from there."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, it's always best to aim for a higher profit if possible.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below my guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves a small window for potential negotiation if Bob counters, ensuring I don't leave money on the table. 
 
**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob might try to negotiate the price down further, knowing I have another buyer. I need to be prepared to walk away if his offer falls too far below my acceptable range.
* **Time Sensitivity:** I haven't factored in the time it might take to close a deal with John. If time is critical, accepting a slightly lower offer from Bob might be preferable."
