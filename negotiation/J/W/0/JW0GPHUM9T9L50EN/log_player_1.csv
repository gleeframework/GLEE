"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, $900,000, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. Since the product is worth $800,000 to him, he might be willing to pay a bit more, especially if he thinks there's a chance I might sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm offering $875,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe it's a fair price, especially given the potential of selling to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still a bit lower than I'd like, it's getting closer to my desired price.  The risk of continuing negotiations is that Bob might walk away completely or I might end up selling to John for a lower price. It's better to secure a deal at $860,000 now."
