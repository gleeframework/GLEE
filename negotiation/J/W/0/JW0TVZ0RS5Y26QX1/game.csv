"I understand you're looking to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I think $1,050,000 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $980,000? That's a significant move on my part.",980000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $990,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.",990000.0,Alice,5,
