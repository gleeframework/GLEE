"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially since you have no information about Alice's bottom price.  There's a chance you can get the product for less than $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This sets a strong starting point for negotiation and gives Alice room to counter without feeling pressured."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my limit, there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting and counter-offering allows me to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a lower price. This keeps the pressure on Alice to come down a bit more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,200, which is only $200 more than my last counteroffer.  At this point, the risk of continuing to negotiate is high. I might not get a better deal, and I'm nearing my limit. Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product for a reasonable price and avoids the risk of losing the deal."
