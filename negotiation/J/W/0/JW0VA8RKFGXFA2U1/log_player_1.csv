Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer lined up."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, there's potential to get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer is slightly below your true value but significantly above Bob's perceived value. This creates a sense of a ""good deal"" for Bob.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** Highlighting a ""limited-time offer"" and the existence of another buyer (""strong offer lined up"") adds pressure and encourages a quicker decision. 
 
**Outcome:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** You gain an extra $100,000 compared to selling to John.
* **If Bob Rejects:** You haven't lost anything and can proceed with selling to John at your desired price."
