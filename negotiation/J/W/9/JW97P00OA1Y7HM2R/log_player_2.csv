"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. It's worth a minimum of $800,000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a price that's beneficial for both of us.  I understand this product is worth $1,000,000 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This gives you a substantial savings while still ensuring I get a fair return.  Let me know your thoughts.
