"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,300,000 is below its worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ let's agree on $1,375,000.  This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your initial offer.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I respect your position, but I need you to meet me closer to the product's true value.  How about we settle at $1,340,000? This is a compromise I'm comfortable with to get this deal done.",1340000.0,Alice,5,
