**Reasoning:**

While it's tempting to push for more, Bob has steadily increased his offer, and we're now at $1,320,000. This is a significant profit above my minimum ($1,200,000).  Continuing to negotiate risks:

* **Bob walking away:** He might decide he's reached his limit.
* **Time pressure:**  We're past the halfway point in negotiations, and John's offer is a safety net, not an ideal outcome. 

Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids potential negative outcomes."
