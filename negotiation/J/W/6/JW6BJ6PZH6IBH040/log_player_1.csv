"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the conversation at $2,300,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  My goal is to maximize profit. By starting significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and my minimum, I leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a price closer to my ideal.
* **Anchoring:** This high initial offer sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even if it's unrealistic, it can influence his perception of the product's value and make subsequent offers seem more reasonable. 
* **Leaving John as Backup:** I'm aware I have a guaranteed offer from John. However, there's potential to earn more from Bob, so I'll pursue that avenue for now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $850,000. This is a serious offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price and my initial offer. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While his message suggests seriousness, I'm confident continued negotiation can yield a better outcome. I'll counter in the next round to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,900,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While I rejected Bob's offer, I need to show flexibility. Dropping the price by $400,000 demonstrates movement and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still Above Valuation:**  This counteroffer remains substantially above both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. It keeps the possibility of a highly profitable deal alive.
* **Maintaining Value Emphasis:** My message reiterates the product's value.  This reinforces its worth in Bob's mind and justifies a higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not able to meet your price.  $1,900,000 is simply too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, but that's my final offer.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but Gap Remains:** Bob increasing his offer to $1,000,000 is significant progress. It shows he's serious and willing to negotiate. However, it's still below my guaranteed offer from John. 
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Bob stating this is his ""final offer"" is likely a negotiation tactic.  It aims to pressure me into accepting quickly. I'll call his bluff by rejecting and countering.
* **Time for Smaller Concessions:**  We're getting closer in our valuations. From here, my concessions will be smaller to signal I'm nearing my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price.  While $1,000,000 isn't feasible, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This feels like a fair compromise, considering the value this product offers."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Movement:**  I'm lowering my price by $300,000, a significant drop but one that keeps me well above Bob's offer and my minimum.  
* **Testing the ""Final Offer"":** My concession tests the seriousness of Bob's previous ""final offer."" If he's genuinely interested, he'll likely counter.
* **Time Constraint:**  We're past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. While I'm not rushing, I'm becoming more aware of the time limit and the need to steer towards a conclusion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. $1,600,000 is still out of my range, but I'm willing to go to $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Reaching a Limit:** Bob's increases are getting smaller, suggesting he's nearing his maximum. Holding out for more might backfire.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of the negotiations falling apart and ensures a prompt, substantial profit. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it for a potentially slightly better one later."
