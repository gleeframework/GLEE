"Alice, your offer is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $850,000. This is a serious offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,900,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not able to meet your price.  $1,900,000 is simply too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, but that's my final offer.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price.  While $1,000,000 isn't feasible, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This feels like a fair compromise, considering the value this product offers.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. $1,600,000 is still out of my range, but I'm willing to go to $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
