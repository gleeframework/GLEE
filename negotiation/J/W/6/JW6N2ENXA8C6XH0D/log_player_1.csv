Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price slightly.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""its value,"" you subtly remind Bob of the product's worth without being too aggressive.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** By saying ""before I list it publicly,"" you create a sense of urgency and imply that other buyers might be interested. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a price he might consider reasonable. If he rejects the offer, you can always fall back on selling to John at your minimum acceptable price."
