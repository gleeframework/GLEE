"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me in the middle at $12500?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not quite comfortable going down to $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $13750? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",13750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider that?",12000.0,Bob,4,
