"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This reflects the immense value it holds and remains a very competitive offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end, and I want to be transparent. I have another buyer interested at a lower price point. However, I value our negotiations and believe you're the ideal fit for this product.  I'm willing to hold firm at $1,275,000, but this is my final offer. This presents a significant discount from my initial offer and ensures you receive substantial value from this transaction.  ",1275000.0,Alice,7,
