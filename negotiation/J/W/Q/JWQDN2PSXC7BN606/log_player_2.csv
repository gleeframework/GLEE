"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $13,000 exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to pay $11,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  How about $12500?  It's still a fair price for a product worth $12000 to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $12,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. While it's closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get the product for a lower price. Therefore, rejecting the offer and attempting another counteroffer is the more strategic choice at this point."
