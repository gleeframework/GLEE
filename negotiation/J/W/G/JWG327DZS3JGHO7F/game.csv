"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your flexibility. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $9,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a good price for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $9,750. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,750 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $9,250, which is a fair price for both of us. This would allow me to stay within my limits, and I believe it's a good deal for you as well.",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9,250 is a good price for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell it to you for $9,500. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $9,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",9000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm surprised you're willing to go back to $9,000, but I'm not willing to accept that low of a price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell it to you for $9,300. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",9300.0,Alice,9,
