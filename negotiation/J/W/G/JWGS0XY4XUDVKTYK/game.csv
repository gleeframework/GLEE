"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $100 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $65. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While $90 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about $75?  That's a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $75 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $85. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think that's as low as I can go. How about we meet at $85?",85.0,Alice,5,
