"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than what I'd receive from another buyer. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that price. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original offer.  How about $1,150,000? This would allow us both to get a good deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers. How about $1,175,000? This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
