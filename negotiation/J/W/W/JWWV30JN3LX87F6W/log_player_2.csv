"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. $110 is too close to his maximum price point. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  How about $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $112.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $112.50 is closer to his goal, it's still above his ideal price point. He's willing to risk another round to see if he can get it down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $112.50 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference at $108.75.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 108.75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're willing to meet me halfway again. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about $109.25? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has been pushing for a lower price and Alice has been slowly coming down.  $109.25 is very close to his target price and he only has 5 rounds left.  At this point, it's likely he won't get a better offer from Alice, and he's close to having to buy from John for $120.  Accepting this offer is the best course of action."
