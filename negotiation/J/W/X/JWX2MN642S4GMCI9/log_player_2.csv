"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make a fair and competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum desired price.**  You're aiming for a price below $1,200,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, so you have time to try and get a better deal.
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** You can always go to John, but you want to exhaust the opportunity with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the starting point. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than where I'm comfortable right now. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it's fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  Starting with a lower counteroffer (significantly below Alice's initial offer) is a good strategy to push for a better deal. This also shows Alice that you are serious about getting the best price.
* **Reasoning & Justification:**  Providing a reason for your offer (being comfortable with a lower price) makes your counteroffer seem more reasonable. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $750,000 is a substantial drop, it still leaves room for Alice to counter and for both parties to find a middle ground in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still above your target.**  While it's a lower price than her initial offer, you're still trying to get below $800,000.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You have 7 rounds left, so it's worth continuing to try and get a lower price.
* **You're closer to your goal.** The price is decreasing with each round. You're likely to get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $800,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  Offering to split the difference between your last offer and Alice's counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise and makes your counteroffer seem reasonable.
* **Confidence in a Fair Price:**  Expressing confidence that $800,000 is fair to both sides helps build a sense of agreement and encourages Alice to accept.
* **Closing the Deal:**  Highlighting that you're confident you can close the deal at this price increases the pressure on Alice to accept and avoids dragging the negotiation on longer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to reach a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Alice's offer of $825,000 is very close to your target price of $800,000. You've already achieved a significant discount from her initial offer.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  You only have 5 rounds left.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential savings of a few thousand dollars are outweighed by the risk of losing the deal entirely. 

By accepting the offer, you secure the product at a price that's within your budget and represents a good deal."
