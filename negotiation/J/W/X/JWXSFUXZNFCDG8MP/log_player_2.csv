"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm aiming for a price around $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. There's room for Alice to come down in price, as the product is only worth $8,000 to her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product's value to me is quite high. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $10,250 is significantly better than John's offer of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject and he'd be forced to buy from John. 
* **Compromise:** $10,250 represents a compromise, and Bob saves a considerable amount compared to John's price."
