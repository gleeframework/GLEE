Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in buying it if we can find a price closer to $8000. Would you be open to negotiating further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really hoping to stay closer to my budget of $8000.  How about we meet in the middle at $9000? It's a fair compromise for both of us.
