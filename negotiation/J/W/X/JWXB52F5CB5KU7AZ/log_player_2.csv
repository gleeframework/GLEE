You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still more than you're willing to pay. You have a better option with John, so it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but let's split the difference.  How about $10000? It's a fair price that gives you a good deal while still allowing me to get a reasonable return. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While $10,000 is closer to your goal, it's still more than what you're willing to pay. John is offering the product at a price that's within your budget, so it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a price closer to $8,000, or you could just buy it from John."
