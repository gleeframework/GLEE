Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000.  This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers.  It's important to start high, but also be realistic about the potential value of the product to Bob.  I'll be ready to counter his offer if he rejects mine, but I'll also be keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter-offer.  $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, but I still think I can get a better deal.  I'll send a counter-offer that's closer to my initial offer, but not quite as high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is still a good profit for me and shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but it's also a significant amount higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will convince him that the product is worth more than $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my initial offer. While I'd prefer to get even more, I need to balance that against the risk of losing the deal completely. 

At this point, accepting the offer and selling the product to Bob for $950,000 seems like the best course of action.  It's a good profit, and there's a chance Bob might not increase his offer further.  I don't want to risk losing out on the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price."
