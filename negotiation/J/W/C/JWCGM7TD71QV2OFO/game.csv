"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $11500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $13000 to make this worthwhile. Let's try to find a middle ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11500 and $13000, which would be $12250. Can we consider that?",12250.0,Bob,4,
