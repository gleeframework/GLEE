"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than what the product is worth to me ($1,000,000). It's in my best interest to try and negotiate a lower price.  I have 10 rounds and the option to go to John, so I'm not in a rush to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value of the product, I'm willing to offer $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer,  lower than Alice's price but still above what I'm willing to pay from John.
* **Fairness:** This offer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while also showing that I'm aware of the product's value.
* **Room for negotiation:** This initial counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $950000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This still gives us both a good margin, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is closer to my ideal price but still a bit higher. I have several rounds left and a good alternative in John.  I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,050,000.  Would you be open to $1,000,000? That price is fair for both of us and allows us to close the deal. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a compromise:**  This offer is at my maximum price, showing I'm serious about buying but still leaving some room for Alice to accept if she's flexible.
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  I'm highlighting that this price benefits both of us, appealing to Alice's desire for a good deal.
* **Closing the deal:**  By explicitly stating the desire to close the deal, I'm emphasizing the urgency for Alice to accept."
