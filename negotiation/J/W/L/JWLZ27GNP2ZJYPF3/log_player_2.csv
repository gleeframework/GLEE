"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd really find it useful. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's start negotiating. Alice's initial offer is way too high. We have plenty of room to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for around $60."",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

We're starting with a low counteroffer to see how Alice reacts. This leaves us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $80 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $60 is significantly below the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is coming down, $130 is still too high. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving closer, Alice.  How about we try $70? That's more than halfway from my last offer."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

We're increasing our offer to show willingness to compromise, but still staying well below our $80 maximum.  This keeps the pressure on Alice to lower her price further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we are too far apart on price. I'm willing to come down to $110, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice seems firm at $110, and while we could probably negotiate her down a bit further, it's unlikely we'll reach a price close enough to our $80 limit. John's offer is a guaranteed win at this point. It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and secure a good deal with John."
