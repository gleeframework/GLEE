Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $12,000. He should counteroffer to see if he can get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my budget.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're firm on your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,250.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000. While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  With only a few rounds left, there's a risk that they won't be able to reach an agreement.  Buying from John guarantees he gets the product at his desired price."
