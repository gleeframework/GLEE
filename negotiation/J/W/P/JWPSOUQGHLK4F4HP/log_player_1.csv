Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $100 to me and potentially more to Bob.  This gives me room to negotiate if he counters. I'll be prepared to accept a lower offer if needed, but I want to see what Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is a decent offer, I'm not willing to sell for less than $100 yet.  I'll counter Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum value of $100. This offer leaves some room for negotiation, but it also shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's latest offer is getting close to my minimum, but I'm not confident I can push him any higher. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum, I'll take the sure thing and sell to John."
