Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a sample offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement):** You have a strong BATNA because you have John willing to buy the product for $800,000.  This means you should accept nothing less.
* **Bob's Position:**  The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. Ideally, he wants to pay as little as possible, but he also wants to avoid losing the deal.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** Any price between $800,000 and what Bob is willing to pay above that is a potential agreement.

**Strategy**

* **Start High:** Aim higher than $800,000. This gives you room to negotiate and might even reveal Bob's willingness to pay more than the estimated value. 
* **Be Confident:** You have a valuable product and a backup offer. Project confidence in your offer.

**Sample Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $950,000. I believe this represents a fair price for such a valuable asset."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  It's positive, highlights value, and provides a reason for the high starting price.
* **The Price:**  Starting at $950,000 gives you negotiating room. Bob might counter, but you have a cushion to work with while still staying above your $800,000 minimum.

**Important Considerations**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob might reject your initial offer. Be ready to counter-offer, but don't go below $800,000.
* **Be Professional and Respectful:**  Maintain a professional tone throughout the negotiation. A positive interaction, even if Bob declines, leaves the door open for future deals."
