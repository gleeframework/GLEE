"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:** A positive and encouraging message can help Bob feel more open to negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the product's value can increase Bob's interest and make him more willing to pay closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $8,500 is still significantly below my minimum of $12,000. 
* **Opportunity to Negotiate:**  I have 10 rounds, so I have time to see if I can get Bob closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is a Backstop:**  Knowing I have the $12,000 offer from John provides me with the security to hold firm during negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we split the difference and settle on $9,250? That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Compromise:** I'm suggesting a middle ground price that's still closer to my desired price point.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,250, which would be $8,875. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Time to Negotiate:** We are only in round 4, and I have 6 more rounds to potentially reach a better price with Bob or fall back on John's offer.
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows him that I'm serious about my price and willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to drop to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I hope you'll agree."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession to show I'm still open to negotiation but not giving up too much ground.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as fair and mutually beneficial, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise again. However, $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,750 is getting closer to my minimum of $12,000, but it's still significantly lower.
* **Limited Negotiation Rounds:** We are only in round 6, and while there's room to keep negotiating, I have only 4 rounds remaining.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me a profit and eliminates the risk of not reaching an acceptable price with Bob. 

Given the limited time remaining and the likelihood that Bob won't meet my minimum price, I've decided to take the guaranteed offer from John."
