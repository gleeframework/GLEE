"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but also reflects the value I place on the product.  I'm confident that I can get at least $150 from John if I need to, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $160 is better than $150, I'm still confident that I can get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm offering $170 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $165 is very close to my desired price.  At this point, it's likely that we'll keep going back and forth with small price adjustments, and there's a good chance we won't reach an agreement.  I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal.  It's a good outcome considering I could have sold to John for less."
