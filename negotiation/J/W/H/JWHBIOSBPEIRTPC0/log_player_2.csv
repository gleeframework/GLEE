"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good price, it's still within your budget.  It's worth seeing if you can get an even better deal by counter-offering.  You have room to negotiate and still come out ahead of buying from John."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. Would you consider $8,800?  That's still a fair price and it would make this a much better deal for me."", ""product_price"": 8800}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I can do $9200, which is a bit more than your offer but still a great deal for you. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to come down a little, but it's still not the price I'm hoping for.  I'm going to counteroffer again to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm not ready to accept just yet, as I still have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9200 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9000? It's a fair price for both of us and would make this a great deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9000. I can do $9350, which is a bit higher than your offer but still a great deal for you. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,350
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,350, which is very close to my ideal price point of $9,000. It's not a massive difference, and I'm starting to feel like further negotiation might be fruitless.  Given that buying from John would cost me $10,000, accepting this offer is the best option to maximize my savings."
