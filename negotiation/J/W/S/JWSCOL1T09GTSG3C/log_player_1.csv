Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find very valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting at $1,100,000, I'm aiming slightly below Bob's perceived value while leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Anchoring:** This high initial offer sets an anchor, potentially influencing Bob to propose counteroffers closer to my desired range.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind John's offer of $800,000 as a safety net. If negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably, I can always fall back on this guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below my target price and his perceived value. I believe there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm looking for a higher price and encourage him to make a more competitive counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction:** I've lowered my price by $100,000, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Midpoint:** This new offer sits closer to the midpoint between my initial ask and Bob's offer, encouraging him to meet me closer to the middle.
* **Maintaining Value:**  I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's worth to both of us, keeping John's $800,000 offer as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I see the value, I'm aiming for a price closer to $900,000. Would that be acceptable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $900,000 is a substantial amount and represents a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price.
* **Reaching a Limit:**  It's likely that Bob won't go much higher, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate value and avoids the uncertainty of prolonged negotiations."
