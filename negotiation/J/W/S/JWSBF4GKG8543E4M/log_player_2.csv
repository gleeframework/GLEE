{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is better than $150, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to try and get a lower price from Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is only slightly better than John's price, and Bob's goal is to save as much as possible. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice once more."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $145 is now only $5 less than John's offer.  There's a high likelihood that further negotiation with Alice will not result in a price lower than $150, and Bob is getting closer to his maximum price limit. To avoid potentially wasting more time and risking an even higher price from Alice, Bob should buy the product from John."
