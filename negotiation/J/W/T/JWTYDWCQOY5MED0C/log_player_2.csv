"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth that much to you and I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. This price still allows for a good profit for you while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. Let's finalize this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still higher than the price he can get from John.  There's no need to continue negotiating with Alice when he has a guaranteed lower price available."
