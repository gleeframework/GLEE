"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, I can't go as low as $9500.  How about we split the difference at $11250? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my asking price. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? That would be a good price for me, and I'm willing to commit to buying the product if we can agree on this price.",10500.0,Bob,4,
