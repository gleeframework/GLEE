Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a strategy for Alice's offer, along with the offer itself:

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible.
* **Avoid Greed:**  If Alice asks for too much, Bob will reject the offer, and she'll get only $1,000,000 from John.
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  Start with a strong offer, leaving room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it holds for you."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Opening:** The offered price of $1,150,000 is intentionally high, aiming to capture a significant portion of the value Bob places on the product.
* **Justification:** The message highlights the ""unique value"" and ""significant benefits,"" subtly justifying the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The wording leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a final price closer to $1,200,000.

This strategy balances ambition with the need to secure a deal, maximizing Alice's potential earnings."
