Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point because it's close to the value Bob places on the product but still gives me some room to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get a better price. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a good deal for me, and it might be enough to convince Bob to buy."
