"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. I'd like to make an offer at that price.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $15000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $18000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $18000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $15000, so how about $16500?",16500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $16500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about $17500?",17500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $17500. I'm willing to go up to $16000, but that's as high as I can go. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",16000.0,Bob,6,
