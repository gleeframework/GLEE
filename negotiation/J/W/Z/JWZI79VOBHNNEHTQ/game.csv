"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product is valuable, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,200,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
