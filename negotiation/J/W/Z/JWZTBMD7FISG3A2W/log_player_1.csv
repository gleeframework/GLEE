Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering my budget and the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $10,500. This still leaves room for negotiation while respecting both our positions.

This is a good point to accept.  Bob is clearly willing to move upward, and getting $500 more than your fallback option with John is a solid outcome."
