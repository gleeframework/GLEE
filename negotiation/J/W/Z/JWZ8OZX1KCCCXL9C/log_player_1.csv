"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also a good starting point to understand Bob's interest and potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. It's better to keep negotiating and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still gives you a significant saving compared to the product's true value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to consider $8,200. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While I could potentially push for a higher price, accepting his offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation rounds or losing the deal entirely."
