"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still gives you a significant saving compared to the product's true value to you. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to consider $8,200. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",8200.0,Bob,4,
