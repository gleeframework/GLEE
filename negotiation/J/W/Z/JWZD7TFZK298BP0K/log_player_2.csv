"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, and I believe it's an excellent value. Would you like to purchase it for $140 today? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is offering it for $140, you should try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. How about $130? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to make a proposal that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $135 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price of $130.  While you could try to push for a lower price, accepting her offer at $135 is a good compromise. It's still a significant saving compared to your initial budget of $150 and  John's offer. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether."
