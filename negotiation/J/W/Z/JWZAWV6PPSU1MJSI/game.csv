"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering at $975,000. This is my final concession, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your offer. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but that's my absolute maximum.  I think this price reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away satisfied.  Let's see if we can find an agreement here.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $925,000, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that's the right price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $1,000,000. I'm counteroffering at $980,000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",980000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get closer to your minimum. However, $980,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's my final offer.  This would allow us to both walk away satisfied with the deal.  Let's settle this and move forward.",950000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to get a bit frustrated. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any higher than $990,000. This is my final offer, and I expect you to meet me at this price or we'll have to part ways.",990000.0,Alice,9,
