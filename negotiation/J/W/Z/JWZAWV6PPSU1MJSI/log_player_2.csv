"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is still too high.  It's within your budget, but you can likely get a better deal. Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to counter and start driving the price down."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While she's come down from her initial offer, you can still potentially get a better price.  It's worth rejecting and continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering at $975,000. This is my final concession, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your ideal price, but it's still a bit high. You have a few rounds left, and you can continue to negotiate. You're not yet at a point where it's worth buying from John, as his price is significantly higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your offer. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but that's my absolute maximum.  I think this price reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away satisfied.  Let's see if we can find an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $925,000, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that's the right price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $1,000,000. I'm counteroffering at $980,000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's close to your ideal price, you've only got three rounds left, and there's still room for negotiation. It's better to reject and try to get closer to your target price.  There's no sense in buying from John right now, as he's significantly more expensive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get closer to your minimum. However, $980,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's my final offer.  This would allow us to both walk away satisfied with the deal.  Let's settle this and move forward."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to get a bit frustrated. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any higher than $990,000. This is my final offer, and I expect you to meet me at this price or we'll have to part ways. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round, and Alice is unlikely to budge further. While her offer is still above your ideal price, it's the best you're likely to get.  Accepting this offer is a good compromise and allows you to acquire the product without spending the significantly higher price from John."
