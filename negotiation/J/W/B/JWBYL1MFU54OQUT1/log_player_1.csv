"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000. This is above Bob's perceived value but gives room for negotiation. It's also a good starting point to see if Bob is genuinely interested.  If he rejects, I'll consider dropping the price a bit in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum of $15,000. I'm going to reject his offer and counteroffer in the next round. I want to see if we can bridge the gap a bit more before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm dropping my price a bit to $17,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible. If he accepts, I'll get a good price. If he rejects, we can keep negotiating, and if it gets too low, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is getting closer to my minimum. I'm going to accept his offer.  I've gotten a better price than John's offer and haven't had to deal with much more negotiation."
