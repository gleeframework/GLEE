"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price considering the value this product offers. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $8,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,250, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to go down to $9,250, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000",8750.0,Bob,6,
