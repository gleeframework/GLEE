"Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product, which I believe would significantly enhance the value and functionality of your operations. Given its exceptional quality and capabilities, I estimate its true worth to be $1200000 from your perspective. However, considering the market conditions, production costs, and the unique features that set this product apart, I am offering it to you at an exclusive price of $1400000. This offer represents a significant saving compared to its market value while still allowing me to cover my costs and ensure a fair profit. I look forward to discussing how this product could benefit your business and hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both parties.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
