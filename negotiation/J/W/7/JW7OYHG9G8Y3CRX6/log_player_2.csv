Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm open to negotiating further if needed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the potential of the product and allows us both to come away satisfied. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. However, I still believe the product's value to you is higher than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,300,000. This price takes into account your concerns while still reflecting the product's true value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, $1,300,000 is still too high.  You have time and room to negotiate further, so rejecting this offer allows you to make a counteroffer closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. Considering your persistence and the value you place on the product, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This price is closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably pay.  I'm going to offer $1,100,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,100,000, which would be $1,175,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, $1,175,000 is still above your ideal price. You've shown your willingness to negotiate and have a few rounds left. Rejecting this offer allows you to make a final counteroffer closer to your target of $1,100,000, or even slightly lower if you're feeling bold. There's still room for a deal that benefits both parties."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your efforts to compromise. However,  $1,175,000 is still a bit higher than I can afford. Let's try to bridge the gap - I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This represents a significant commitment from my side, and I truly believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. This is my final offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're making a significant commitment with your offer of $1,150,000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you halfway between $1,175,000 and $1,150,000, which would be $1,162,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,162,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,162,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You are one round away from buying from John. Alice has already moved significantly closer to your target price, and you're already within $12,500 of your ideal price. Rejecting this offer allows you to make one final counteroffer. Aim for a price slightly lower than $1,150,000, perhaps $1,140,000 or $1,145,000. There's a good chance Alice will accept to avoid losing the deal altogether. If she doesn't, you can still buy from John and avoid overpaying significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we've come a long way in this negotiation, and I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm going to make one final offer of $1,145,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to close this deal.  It's your call â€“ if you accept, we can finalize the transaction. If not, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1145000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is your final chance to strike a deal with Alice. You've already demonstrated your willingness to negotiate, and you're within a reasonable range of your target price. 
* **Slight Compromise:**  The offer is slightly lower than your previous offer, but it's still above your ideal price. It's a compromise that shows you're serious about closing the deal.
* **Leaving Room for Acceptance:**  While it's a firm offer, it leaves a small amount of room for Alice to accept. This is especially important since you are on the last round. 
* **Prepared to Walk Away:** The message emphasizes that you're willing to walk away if necessary, creating pressure on Alice to accept. 

If Alice rejects this offer, you can buy from John for $1,500,000, but you'll be saving $355,000 by getting it from Alice."
