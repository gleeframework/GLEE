Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I like the idea of splitting the difference, but I was thinking more along the lines of $107.50. That way, I can still make a bit of a profit, and you'll get a good deal. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear Alice is very reluctant to move below $100.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a better price than John's offer."
