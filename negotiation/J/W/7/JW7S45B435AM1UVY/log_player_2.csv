"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a product that I believe holds immense value for you.  Knowing it's worth $1,000,000 to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. This offer reflects the significant value it holds, and while I have another interested buyer, I believe you would benefit most from its acquisition. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and buy from John for a much lower price."
