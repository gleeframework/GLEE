"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could we settle around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you. However, we believe the product's value to you is higher than $700,000. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. This is the lowest price we're willing to accept for the product.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I agree the product is valuable, $825,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable with. Could you consider $750,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. We're willing to consider your proposal, but we're still not comfortable with $750,000. We're willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $775,000. This is our final offer, and we hope it meets your requirements.",775000.0,Alice,5,
