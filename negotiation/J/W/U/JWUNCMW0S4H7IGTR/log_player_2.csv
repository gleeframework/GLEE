# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. We're willing to consider your proposal, but we're still not comfortable with $750,000. We're willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $775,000. This is our final offer, and we hope it meets your requirements.

This is a good price for the product, considering its value to you and Alice's starting price. It's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate a significantly better price in the remaining rounds."
