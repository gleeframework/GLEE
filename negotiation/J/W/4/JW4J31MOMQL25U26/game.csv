"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $15000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've seen from other potential buyers. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $12500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $14000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
