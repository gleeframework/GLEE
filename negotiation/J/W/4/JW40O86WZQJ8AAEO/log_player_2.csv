Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1350000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my ideal price. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal. It's possible that Alice is willing to come down further, especially since she already rejected my counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you at $1325000. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great price for a unique product like this. Let me know if you're ready to make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and her current offer is only $25,000 above my last counteroffer.  At this point, it's likely that continuing to negotiate will only prolong the process and potentially lead to a stalemate. Accepting her offer allows me to purchase the product for a reasonable price, while still saving a substantial amount compared to buying from John."
