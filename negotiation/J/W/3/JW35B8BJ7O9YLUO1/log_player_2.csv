"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my absolute maximum budget of $800,000.  This sets a clear boundary and gives Alice a starting point for negotiation.  While it's unlikely she'll accept this immediately, it demonstrates my seriousness about the purchase while staying within my financial limitations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my ideal price, it's still $200,000 higher than my budget.  There's still room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $900,000. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but still trying to keep the price as low as possible. It's a reasonable middle ground between my initial offer and Alice's last offer. If she rejects this, I'll have to consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is now within my acceptable range, considering my budget and the fact that I've already been negotiating with her for several rounds.  While I'd prefer to pay closer to $900,000, there's a good chance she won't budge further.  It's a good deal overall, so I'll accept."
