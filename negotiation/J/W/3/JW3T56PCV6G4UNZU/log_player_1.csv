"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my ideal price point with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to get from this deal.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise, and allows us both to walk away happy. "", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This is a bit closer to my target, and I'm willing to make a serious offer at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still have time and I believe I can push for a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000. This price is still significantly higher than selling to John, and it gives you a great deal. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,000,000, Bob's offer of $980,000 is still a significant improvement over selling to John for $800,000.  Given that we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
