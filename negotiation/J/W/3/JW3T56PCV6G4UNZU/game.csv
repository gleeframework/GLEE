"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you, and allows me to earn a good return on my investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to get from this deal.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise, and allows us both to walk away happy. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This is a bit closer to my target, and I'm willing to make a serious offer at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000. This price is still significantly higher than selling to John, and it gives you a great deal. Let's close this deal!",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",980000.0,Bob,6,
