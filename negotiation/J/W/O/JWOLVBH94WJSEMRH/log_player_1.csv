Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get as close to the market value as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell to him quickly, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my ideal value. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8800 is still a bit higher than I was thinking. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8800 and $8200, so how about $8500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a slightly higher price, $8,500 is a good compromise and it's still significantly more than what John is offering.  It's important to reach a mutually agreeable price, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this outcome."
