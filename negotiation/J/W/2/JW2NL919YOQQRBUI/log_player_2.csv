"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value to you, I propose a price of $140 for it. This is a special offer considering the quality and benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than the asking price in negotiations. This leaves room for bargaining.
* **Target Price:** My goal is to pay no more than $120. Starting at $100 gives me some space to potentially meet in the middle.
* **Alternative:**  I have the option to buy from John at $120, so I'm not desperate to accept a price close to Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'll offer the product for $125 this time. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still reflecting the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming closer to my price range, but I'm still willing to negotiate a bit further. I'm aiming for a price closer to $110, which is a reasonable compromise between her offer and my ideal price. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $112?"",
""product_price"": 112
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This is a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties.  It shows I'm willing to move closer to her price.
* **Target Range:** $112 is a price I'm comfortable with and still saves me money compared to Alice's previous offer and buying from John.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  While I have a few rounds left, I want to try and close the deal sooner rather than later in case Alice becomes less flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. Considering the value of the product and your budget, how about we set the price at $118? I believe this strikes a good balance between fairness and profitability. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $118 is very close to my target price and only $2 more than my last counteroffer. It's unlikely I'll get a significantly better deal from Alice.
* **Time Investment:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more rounds and might not result in much more savings. Accepting now saves time and avoids potential frustration.
* **Minimal Loss:** While I could buy from John for $120, the $2 difference is negligible for the potential hassle of switching sellers."
