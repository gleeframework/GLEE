"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're enthusiastic about the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. Let's see if we can make this work.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,500.  It's a fair price considering the value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
