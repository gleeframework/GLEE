"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9800. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",9800.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not comfortable selling the product at $9800. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10400. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10400.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $10400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10200, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider this price?",10200.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $10200. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10500. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
