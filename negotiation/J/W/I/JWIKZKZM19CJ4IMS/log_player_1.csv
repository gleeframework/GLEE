"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum value, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $10,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,750. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's counteroffer. I believe this is a good compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer $9,500. This is a significant concession, but I'm confident this is a fair price that is close to Bob's perceived value.  I'm hoping he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting increasingly difficult to reach a profitable agreement with Bob. We've gone through several rounds, and the gap is narrowing, but he's not budging much. Rather than risk continuing to negotiate and potentially end up with a lower price, it's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $12,000. This guarantees me a better return than I would likely get from Bob at this point."
