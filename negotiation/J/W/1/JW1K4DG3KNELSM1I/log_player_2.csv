"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get an even better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's room for counteroffers as Bob's maximum price is $1,200,000 and Alice's minimum price is likely closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a deal for $875,000. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than Bob's initial maximum price of $1,200,000 and closer to Bob's desired price point.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
