"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a fantastic investment that will bring you great value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good starting point, it's still above your desired price range. You have a clear goal of saving as much money as possible, and rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and within your budget.  While you could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject your next offer and you'd have to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product for a price that's still a good deal and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiations."
