Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. I am willing to pay $8,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  $8,500 is still below my minimum, and I have time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $8,800. Let's try to meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I can only offer $8,600 for the product. This seems like a fair compromise between our values. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $8,600 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to $9,000. I have time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but $8,600 is still a bit below what I need to let this go.  How about $8,700? That's a fair compromise, and it's getting us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 8700}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget and the value I place on the product, I would like to offer $8,650. This seems to be a reasonable compromise that respects both of our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,650
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, it's getting close to my minimum and I'm worried that I might not be able to get a better offer from Bob.  Plus, I'm getting concerned I might run out of time.  It's a better deal than selling to John, but not as good as I was initially hoping for."
