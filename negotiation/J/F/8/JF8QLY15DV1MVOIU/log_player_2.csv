"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can do better than $1,150,000. He has a ceiling of $1,200,000 and knows the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still reflects the value I'm providing, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is within Bob's budget and still saves him $100,000 compared to buying from John.  While there's always a chance he could negotiate further, accepting the offer ensures a deal and avoids the risk of Alice walking away or John's price changing."
