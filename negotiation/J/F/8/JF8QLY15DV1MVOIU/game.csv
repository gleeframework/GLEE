"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still reflects the value I'm providing, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
