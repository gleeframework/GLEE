Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. 
* This is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but lower than Bob's maximum willingness to pay of $12,000. 
* This gives Bob a potential gain of $500, making the offer appealing to him. 
* However, it also secures me a profit of $1,500, which is better than the $10,000 I would get from John.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a sale. It's a calculated risk, as Bob might reject the offer, but it's a good starting point to negotiate."
