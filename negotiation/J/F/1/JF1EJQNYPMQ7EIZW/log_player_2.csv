"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. How about we try $8,000? That's the highest I can go. "", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're really interested in the product, but $8,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise a bit further. How about we meet at $14,000? I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Alice is not budging much and is still way above your budget.  You've given her a fair chance. It's time to cut your losses and go with your safe option, John, for $8,000."
