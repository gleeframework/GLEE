"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. How about we try $8,000? That's the highest I can go. ",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're really interested in the product, but $8,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise a bit further. How about we meet at $14,000? I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,
