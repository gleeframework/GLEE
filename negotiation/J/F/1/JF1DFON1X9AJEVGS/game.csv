"Hi Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. I know it would be a valuable asset to your operations.  Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen on the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000? I think that's a fair deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but $900,000 undervalues the product's true potential. To meet you halfway, I can offer it for $1,030,000. This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest.",1030000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the effort. While $1,030,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about $950,000?  That feels like a good compromise to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect your approach to negotiation. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle on $1,000,000 even? This price acknowledges the product's value while recognizing your willingness to make a deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,000,000 is still a touch higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $970,000?  I think that's a fair offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",970000.0,Bob,6,
