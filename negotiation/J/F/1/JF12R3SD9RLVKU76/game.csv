,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to get at least $850,000 for this product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? That's a significant jump from my last offer.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $775,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not there yet.  How about $825,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to keep the product in my hands for a while longer.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting close.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. That's a very fair price, and it would save both of us time and effort in further negotiations.",800000.0,Bob,6,
