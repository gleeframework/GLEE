"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's value, $1,100,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is my highest offer, as I'm already very close to my budget limit.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, however,  $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a substantial reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to pay $937,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",937500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $937,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept such a significant loss. My final offer is $980,000.  This price reflects the product's true value while still offering you a reasonable deal.  Let me know your decision.",980000.0,Alice,5,
