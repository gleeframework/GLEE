Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I still need to make a profit, and $11,500 is getting closer but not quite there.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your frustration, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $12,000. However, I've already had an offer from John to buy the product for $12,000, and I'm not sure if I want to wait any longer to close the deal. I'm willing to meet you at $13,250, but I need to be clear that this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll need to consider selling to John. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a tough one, but it's better to accept and move on. Here's why:

* **Alice is playing hardball:** She's revealed she has another offer at $12,000 and is using it as leverage. 
* **Time is running out:** You only have one round left after this, and there's no guarantee you can get her lower.
* **The difference is marginal:** $13,250 is only slightly above your ideal price and significantly less than John's $15,000.

It's frustrating, but sometimes in negotiations, you have to take a slightly less ideal deal to avoid losing out entirely."
