"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd be willing to accept from John to see if I can get a better deal.  I'm also being positive and emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum threshold of $100. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $95?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum threshold. I'm also trying to build rapport by acknowledging his offer and emphasizing that it's a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  That seems fair to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $90. While it's still less than my ideal price, it's above my minimum threshold of $100, and it seems like Bob is unlikely to go higher. I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
