"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, we're confident it's worth more than $80 to you. Considering its worth to you is $100, I'd like to propose a fair deal. Would you be interested in purchasing this product for $95? This offer allows us both to benefit from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

You can get the product from John for $100, which is less than Alice's offer of $95.  It's always better to pay less for the same product!"
