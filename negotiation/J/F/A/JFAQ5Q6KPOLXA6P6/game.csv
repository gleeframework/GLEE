"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a much lower price to make it work. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. Let me see what I can do. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Could you do $11,500? That would be a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, which is a compromise that I think is reasonable.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer!  How about we split the difference between $11,500 and $13,500 and settle on $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I like the idea of splitting the difference, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000, which is closer to my minimum price. Would you be willing to meet me there?",13000.0,Alice,7,
