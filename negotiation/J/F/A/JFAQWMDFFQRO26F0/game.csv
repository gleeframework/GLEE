"Alice, I've been willing to negotiate with you for several rounds, and I'm still interested in the product. However, I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $130, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider other options.",130.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $145. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Would you be willing to meet me at $142?",142.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I've made it clear that $130 is my maximum price. I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm starting to think that I'll have to explore other options, including buying from John for $120. I'd like to reiterate that I'm still interested in the product, but I need to make a decision soon.",130.0,Bob,10,
