{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's better to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. This will give Alice a strong incentive to counter, and we can then work towards a mutually agreeable price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but it's closer to my target price. I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm not willing to go much higher. I'm hoping this will push Alice towards a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, I'm still not willing to pay over $1,000,000.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get her to drop her price further.  If she rejects, I'll buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above my budget, and we only have a few rounds left. I've already made my maximum offer, and it seems unlikely she'll go lower.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for my target price."
