"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,000. This is still a great deal, considering its true value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10000.0,Alice,3,
