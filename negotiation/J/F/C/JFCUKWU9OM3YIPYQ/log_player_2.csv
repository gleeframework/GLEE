"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than my maximum price ($12,000) to give myself room to negotiate upward. 
* **Anchoring:**  By throwing out a low number first, I'm trying to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired range.  Alice might be more willing to come down if she sees I'm serious but starting with a lowball offer. 
* **Leaving Room:** This leaves space for a back-and-forth negotiation where we can potentially meet somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice met me halfway from her original offer, $14,000 is still $2,000 over my budget and $2,000 more expensive than John's offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still potential for Alice to come down further, especially since she acknowledged my budget constraints.

I'll continue negotiating, but I need to push Alice closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. However, $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $11,000? That's a fair offer, considering the market value and my budget."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** I'm increasing my offer by $1,000, showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not budging significantly.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""market value"" I'm subtly reminding Alice that her valuation ($15,000) might be inflated compared to what I can get elsewhere (John's offer). 
* **Staying Below John:** My offer is still strategically below John's price ($12,000) to allow for a potential counteroffer from Alice that benefits me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice has clearly stated this is her final offer. 
* **John's Offer is Better:**  At $13,000, Alice's offer is still $1,000 more expensive than John's. It's not worth continuing the negotiation for a minimal potential saving.

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and take advantage of John's offer."
