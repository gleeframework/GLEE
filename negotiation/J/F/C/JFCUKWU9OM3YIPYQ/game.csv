"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $12,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. However, $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $11,000? That's a fair offer, considering the market value and my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",13000.0,Alice,5,
