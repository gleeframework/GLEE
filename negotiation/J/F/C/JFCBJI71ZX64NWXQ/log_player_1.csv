Bob's offer:

You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:

``` 

While I could push for more, accepting $175 is a reasonable profit above my minimum. It's not worth the risk of Bob walking away for a mere $5 difference."
