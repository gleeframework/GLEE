"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,600,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  I believe that's a fair offer considering its potential.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is my final offer.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, and I'm serious about making a deal.  However, $1,400,000 is still too far out of my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
