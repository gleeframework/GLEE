Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  I think this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:** This leaves room for negotiation and potential counteroffers. 
* **It's a clear and direct offer:** This helps start the negotiation process smoothly. 

Let me know if you'd like me to continue the negotiation based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $10,800 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,800 is more than Bob's initial value, it's still below my minimum. It's important to remember my goal is to maximize profit. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,200. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and my willingness to negotiate. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I've considered your proposal, and I would like to suggest a price of $11,000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle of our negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$11,000 is a good deal for me. It's very close to my ideal price and it's a better offer than John's. While I could potentially continue negotiating and try to get closer to my $12,000 minimum, the risk of Bob walking away is high.  I'll accept his offer and secure the sale."
