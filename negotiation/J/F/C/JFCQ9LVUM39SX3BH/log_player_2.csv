Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have to consider my own needs, and $13,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $17,500. This is a fair price that I think we can both be comfortable with. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500.

I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll compromise a bit further. I'm counteroffering at $16,250. This price takes into account the value you're seeking, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?
