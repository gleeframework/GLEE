"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $10,000 to us, but considering its value to you, we're willing to start negotiations at $8,500. Let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to propose a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's initial offer is a good starting point, there's likely room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $8,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 7000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's seriousness in saving money. It's also not too low, leaving room for further negotiation while still being within Bob's budget. This approach aims to quickly establish a range for negotiations while demonstrating a willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'm willing to consider it. In light of your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $7,500 for the product. This is our best offer based on our costs and the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to continue negotiating. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $7,500, which is a significant drop from her initial offer and is only $500 more than Bob's counteroffer. Accepting this offer means saving $2,500 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and the time constraint of 10 rounds make accepting this offer a sensible choice."
