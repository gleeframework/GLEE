"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that's worth no less than $1200000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. I understand this is a significant investment, but I believe the potential benefits far outweigh the cost.  Let me know your thoughts.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000, which is your maximum budget.  While you don't know the value to Alice, you know that it's worth at least $1,200,000 to her. This means there's potential for negotiation if you were to reject the offer. However, since you have a guaranteed alternative at the same price with John, there's no benefit to trying to negotiate with Alice. You're better off buying from John to avoid any risk."
