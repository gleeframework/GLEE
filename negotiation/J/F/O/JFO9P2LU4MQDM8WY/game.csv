"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $112? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product!",112.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $112 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $108? It's a fair compromise for both of us.",108.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $108. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $115 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!",115.0,Alice,5,
