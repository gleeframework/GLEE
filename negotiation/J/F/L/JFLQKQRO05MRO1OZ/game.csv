"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to be mindful of my finances.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're working within a budget.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $6,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",6500.0,Bob,4,
