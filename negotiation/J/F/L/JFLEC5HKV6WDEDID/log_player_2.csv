"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still too high for Bob.  He can likely get a better deal by negotiating further.  Buying from John would be a worse option as the price is higher."

Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll compromise at $1,250,000. I believe this price reflects the product's true value and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than what Bob wants to pay, but it's getting closer. If Bob rejects this offer, he risks Alice getting even more stubborn and the negotiation taking longer.  Plus, buying from John would be even more expensive. It's likely that Alice won't budge further, so Bob is better off accepting this offer and securing the product."
