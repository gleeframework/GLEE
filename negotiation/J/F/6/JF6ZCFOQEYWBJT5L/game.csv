"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000. How about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm open to negotiations. But $975,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth.  While I'm willing to compromise, I can't go lower than $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is closer to my target price. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",950000.0,Bob,6,
