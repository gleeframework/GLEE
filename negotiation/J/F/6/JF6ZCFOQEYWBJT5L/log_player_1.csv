"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's estimated value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate while still potentially earning a good profit.
* **Reasoning:** I'm offering a justification for the price, highlighting its value to Bob. This might make him more receptive to the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to counter if he's interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and there's a chance he might be willing to pay more.
* **Selling to John is a safe option:** However, I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not in a rush to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000.
* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""middle ground"" between our positions.
* **Value justification:** I'm reiterating the value of the product, suggesting that $1,050,000 is a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000. How about $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below minimum:** $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Time to increase pressure:** I've already made a concession, and it seems Bob is not willing to budge much. I need to show him that I'm serious about getting my desired price.
* **Exploring other options:** While selling to John for $1,500,000 is always an option, I still have 6 rounds left to negotiate with Bob and see if we can reach a more favorable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm open to negotiations. But $975,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth.  While I'm willing to compromise, I can't go lower than $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Standing my ground:**  I'm not giving in to Bob's pressure to drop below $1,000,000. I need to show him that I'm serious about getting a price closer to my target. 
* **Slight concession:** I'm offering a slight concession from $1,050,000 to $1,000,000, showing flexibility but still staying within a reasonable range.
* **Fairness emphasis:** I'm reiterating the value of the product and framing $1,000,000 as a fair price for both parties. 
* **Seeking agreement:** I'm ending the message on a positive note, hoping to encourage Bob to reconsider and agree on a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is closer to my target price. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is running out:** We are in round 6, meaning only 4 rounds remain.  
* **Bob's stubbornness:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. He seems unwilling to budge significantly.
* **Risk of a lower offer:** If I continue to negotiate with Bob, there's a risk he might offer even less in the next round.
* **Guaranteeing a profit:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me a substantial profit, exceeding my minimum target. 

With limited time remaining and the potential for a lower offer from Bob, it's better to secure the guaranteed profit by selling to John."
