"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product for less than $100 from Alice, so rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $95. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but you can likely still get a better deal. Rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer is the best option to try and secure a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go below $98. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $94. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $94. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $94
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $94 is a good deal for you, considering your maximum budget is $120. While you might be able to get a slightly lower price by continuing to counteroffer, there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and you risk wasting time.  Accepting her offer ensures you get the product at a price you're comfortable with."
