"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $95. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  This would be a great deal for both of us.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go below $98. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $94. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",94.0,Alice,5,
