"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $650,000. This product is valuable to me, but I need to be sure the price reflects its true market value.  What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the market value of the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $725,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $700,000? I believe this price is fair considering the market value and the potential benefits this product offers.  Let's finalize this deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go up to $700,000. I'm still confident that the product's worth to you is $800,000, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $750,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,5,
