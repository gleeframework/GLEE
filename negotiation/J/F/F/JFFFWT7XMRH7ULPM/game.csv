"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is the very top of my budget for this.  If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
