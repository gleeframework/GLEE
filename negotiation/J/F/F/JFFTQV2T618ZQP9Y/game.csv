"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $10,000 to make it work.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $20,000 represents the high-end of the value,  $10,000 is significantly below its worth. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product has a good value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Could we try something around $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $11,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $13,750?",13750.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  I could potentially do $12,500, but that's really pushing my limit.",12500.0,Bob,6,
