"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value and leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will find this price attractive, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is a better deal than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm countering with $105. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. There's still room for negotiation, and selling to John for $80 is still the worst option.  I'll counter with another price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm countering with $100. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  The negotiation is getting tight, so I'm hoping this will be the final offer Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to selling, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I have a few rounds left and believe I can still get a better price. Selling to John is still the worst option. I'll make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 98}
```

I'm countering with $98. This is a slight compromise, but still above Bob's offer. With only a few rounds left, I need to start moving towards a deal, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $88 is getting close to John's offer, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll reject his offer and counter with one final offer before potentially selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

This is my final offer. It's still above John's offer, but shows I'm willing to close the deal. I'm hoping Bob will accept this price before time runs out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only one round remaining,  I'm going to sell the product to John for $80. It's not my desired price, but it's better than risking getting nothing from Bob.  There's a high chance he won't accept my counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing everything."
