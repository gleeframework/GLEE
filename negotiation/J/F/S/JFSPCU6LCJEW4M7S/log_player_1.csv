Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This price is fair considering it's significantly less than your asking price and still allows you to make a profit.  Let me know what you think.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
