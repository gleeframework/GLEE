"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to me is $12,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to make a deal happen.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This price is fair considering it's significantly less than your asking price and still allows you to make a profit.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $9,500 is still a little out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This price is a fair compromise, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",9250.0,Alice,5,
