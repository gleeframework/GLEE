"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $800,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about $950,000?  I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value it brings to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, I can't go as low as $950,000.  My bottom line is $1,250,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my strong desire to do business with you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your bottom line, but it's still a bit high for me.  I could meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This would be a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,6,
