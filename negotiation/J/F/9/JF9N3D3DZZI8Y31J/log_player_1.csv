Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $10,000. This is a fair price, and it gives us both a good outcome.  Let's see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here, but $9,000 just isn't going to work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? It's a good deal for both of us, and we can finally close this."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's lower than what I initially hoped for, it's still above my minimum, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's better to close the deal with Bob now than risk losing him and having to sell to John at a lower price."
