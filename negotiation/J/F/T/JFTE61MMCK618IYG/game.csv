"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $8,500 to make this work.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us.  How does that sound?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $8,000. That's my final offer. If I don't get it, I'll have to consider other options.",8000.0,Bob,4,
