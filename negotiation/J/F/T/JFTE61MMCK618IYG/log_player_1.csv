Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be worth every penny. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I need to get. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to give it away.  I believe I can get a better deal with Bob or, if necessary, go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $8,500 to make this work.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us.  How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $8,000. That's my final offer. If I don't get it, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my target of $10,000, Bob's offer of $8,000 is close enough to my minimum threshold of $10,000. There is a risk that I might not get a better deal with Bob in the following rounds, and I'm not sure if I want to risk losing the deal completely.  Selling to John for $10,000 is always an option, but I think $8,000 is a fair compromise."
