"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  It's a unique opportunity and I believe it can be very valuable for your business.  My asking price is $1,200,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value it offers. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $650,000 is lower than I expected, I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to offer the product for $900,000. This price still allows me to get a good return on my investment while offering you a significant value.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $900,000 is closer, but it's still a touch high for my budget.  How about we settle at $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $725,000 just doesn't work for me. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to drop my price to $850,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $850,000 is tempting, I'm aiming for a final price closer to $750,000. Would you be open to considering that figure?",750000.0,Bob,6,
