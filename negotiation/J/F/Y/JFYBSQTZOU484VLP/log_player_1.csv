**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing in smaller increments.  It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's acceptable to me (above $1,200,000) within the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob's negotiations stalling."
