Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $120 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $120, which is higher than the product's worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate, which can make Bob more likely to engage.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm mentioning that the product is ""amazing"" to try to increase Bob's perceived value.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit, so I'm starting high and hoping for a counteroffer that's closer to my target price. If Bob rejects my offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer. If the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome, I have the option to sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While it's tempting to accept his offer, doing so would result in a loss for me. Therefore, I'm rejecting his offer and proceeding to the next round.

**Strategy:**

I'll use the next round to try and negotiate a price closer to my desired range.  I can either counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer or try to convince Bob to increase his offer. However, if the negotiation continues to stall, I'm prepared to sell to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference? I'd be happy to accept $105 for the product. That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This is a common negotiation tactic that can make the other party feel like they are getting a good deal.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm mentioning that this price would be ""fair"" for both of us. This helps to build rapport and makes the offer more appealing.
* **Maintaining My Minimum:** I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price of $100. This ensures that I don't lose money on the deal.

**Strategy:**

By offering a compromise, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I have a bottom line. This gives me a good chance of reaching a mutually acceptable agreement while still securing a profit. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to consider whether to accept his counteroffer or sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I've already made two counteroffers and the negotiations seem to be getting nowhere.  I'm running the risk of a lengthy negotiation process without any guarantee of reaching a profitable agreement for me.  

**Strategy:**

I've decided to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $100. This guarantees me a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob. While I would have preferred to get a higher price, it's important to be realistic and know when to walk away from a deal."
