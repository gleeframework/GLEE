"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture a good chunk of the value gap. I'm confident Bob will find this attractive, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,300,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I will reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher price than Bob's last offer, but still significantly lower than my initial proposal. This shows flexibility while aiming to secure a deal closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now only $50,000 less than what John is offering. Accepting this offer is the best option as it minimizes risk and maximizes potential profit.  Further negotiation could result in a lower price, making John's offer more attractive."
