"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,800,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,800,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to pay $1,500,000, which is a fair price based on the product's value and my budget. Let's finalize this deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,500,000. I can offer it to you for $1,650,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value and rarity. Let's meet in the middle and finalize the deal.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
