"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. I'll see if Bob is willing to bite, and if not, I'll adjust based on his counteroffer.  Remember, I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 at any time if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $16,000 is better than my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I have 8 rounds left, so I have time to see if we can come to a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a good profit. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, I've already had a few rounds of negotiations and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  $16,500 is a good price, and I'm confident I can find a way to make up for the difference elsewhere."
