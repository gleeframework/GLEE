**Reasoning:**

While Bob hasn't met my ideal price, he's been firm at $950,000.  It's becoming clear he's unlikely to budge significantly. Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit ($150,000 over my minimum) and avoids the risk of a stalemate, potentially losing both Bob and John's deals."
