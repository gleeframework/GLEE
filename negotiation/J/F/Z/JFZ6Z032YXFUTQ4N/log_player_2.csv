* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by rejecting the offer and counter-offering. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** You're not desperate to buy from Alice, so you have the option to go with John if the negotiations with Alice don't work out."

```

**Reasoning:**
