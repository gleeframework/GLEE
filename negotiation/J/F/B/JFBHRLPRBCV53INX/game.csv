"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,500 at this time. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll need to go with John's offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $10,000. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I can offer it to you for $12,000. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
