"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to start with a price that reflects its true value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You want to save as much money as possible, and $1,100,000 is still too high.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $1050000 to make it worth my while. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,050,000 is closer to your ideal price, it's still above your desired price point. Continue negotiating to see if you can get Alice to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This would allow you to cover your costs and still make a profit, while giving me a fair price.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000 was too low for me, but I can see that you're serious about this deal. I'm willing to come down to $1020000, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You've come a long way in negotiations and Alice has come down significantly.  At $1,020,000, you're still well within your budget and getting a good deal. It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking further negotiation."
