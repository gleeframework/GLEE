"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to your business.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this price better reflects the value I can get out of the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still not convinced that $1,325,000 is the right number. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'm proposing $1,312,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1312500.0,Bob,4,
