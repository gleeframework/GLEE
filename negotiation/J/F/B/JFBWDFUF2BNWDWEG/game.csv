"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and it allows me to make a decent profit.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $8,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000.  This gives you a good deal, and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $8,500. I'm confident that this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
