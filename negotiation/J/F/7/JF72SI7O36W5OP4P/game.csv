"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and I offer $1,150,000? ",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,075,000 is still too low for me.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,125,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, which is the absolute maximum I can go. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,100,000.  Unfortunately, that's still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  If you're serious about acquiring this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,110,000 as a final offer.  Let me know your decision.",1110000.0,Alice,7,
