"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $999500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $850000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $925000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $925000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about we split the difference and go with $900000? I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I'm willing to consider another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you at $915000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. What do you think?",915000.0,Alice,5,
