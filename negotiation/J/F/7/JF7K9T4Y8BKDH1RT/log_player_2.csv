"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $999500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a good starting point.  Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget, so there's room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $999,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $850,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $925000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still higher than your desired price, so it's worth trying to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer will give you a chance to make another counteroffer and see if you can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $925,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about we split the difference and go with $900,000? I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I'm willing to consider another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you at $915000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point,  Alice's offer is only slightly higher than your last counteroffer and closer to your desired price range.  Accepting the offer saves you from potentially another round of negotiation and also secures the product for a lower price than John's offer."
