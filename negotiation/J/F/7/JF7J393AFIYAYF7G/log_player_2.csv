(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

Bob is still trying to get a better price. He can reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $160 is still a bit high for me. How about $140?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to buy."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
