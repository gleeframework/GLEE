Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $18,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're still trying to negotiate a lower price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'll meet you at $13,500, which is a bit higher than your last offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $13,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  I'm prepared to offer $12,750.  If you're unable to accept that, I'll unfortunately need to consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 12750}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still trying to get the best deal. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $13,250, which is the highest price I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've spent negotiating. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and she's unlikely to go below $13,250.  At this point, continuing to negotiate with Alice has a low chance of success in getting the price near your target.  You can save a significant amount ($13,250 vs $10,000) by going with John, even though you spent time negotiating with Alice."
