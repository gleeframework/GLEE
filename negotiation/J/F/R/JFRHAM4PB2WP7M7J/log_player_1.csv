Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully earn a higher price than my minimum.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and inviting, making Bob feel more comfortable to engage in a negotiation.
* **Justification:** I've provided a reason for the price to make it seem more reasonable to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates I'm open to discussing the price further. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've secured a good price and can move on to the transaction.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to assess his counteroffer and consider whether it's worth continuing negotiations. If his offer is too low, I might choose to sell to John instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $9,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $9,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Accepting this offer would be a loss for me.
* **Potential for better negotiation:**  Although Bob rejected my initial offer, he's still interested in the product. This suggests a potential for further negotiation. 
* **John is a backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer provides me with security and allows me to negotiate more aggressively with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my desired price. I might start with $10,500 or $10,000, depending on my confidence in securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  I'm happy to accept $10,000 for the product.  This is the absolute lowest I can go, considering its value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer but am still standing firm at my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to justify my price. 
* **Finality:** The message suggests this is my final offer, adding pressure for Bob to accept. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've successfully negotiated a good price and can move forward with the transaction.
* **If Bob rejects:** I might choose to either sell to John for $10,000 or make one more counteroffer, depending on how confident I am in getting Bob to accept."
