"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I have to consider the value of the product to me as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and the value it would bring to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I see your point, I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my budget. I'm happy to meet you a little closer, but I can only go up to $1,100,000. This is still a good deal for you considering you can easily get that amount from John. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I'd like to add a condition: I'll throw in some additional services and support worth $50,000 for free, which will increase the overall value of the product to you. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000, but I need to make it worth your while. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, and I'm intrigued by the additional services. However, I'm still working within a tight budget, and $1,150,000 is pushing my limits.  To make this work, I'd need to drop the price to $1,100,000. This would be a fair compromise, and I'm ready to move forward if we can agree on this price. To ensure we're both on the same page, could you please provide more details about the specific services you're offering? Understanding exactly what they entail will help me decide if they're truly valuable to me.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm happy to provide more details about the services I'm offering. The additional services I mentioned include a comprehensive setup and training package, worth $50,000, which will ensure a smooth transition and maximize the product's potential for you. I'll also provide priority support and maintenance for the next 6 months, valued at $20,000. These services will not only enhance the product's value but also give you a competitive edge in your industry. Considering the value you'll receive, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,160,000. This is a fair price, considering the additional value I'm providing.",1160000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to explain the services in more detail. While I see the potential value in the setup and training package, I'm not entirely convinced about the priority support and maintenance being worth the additional $20,000. I'm also mindful of my budget, and $1,160,000 is still pushing my limits. To make this work, I'm willing to offer $1,120,000 for the product, including the setup and training package. If you're willing to consider this price, we can discuss the priority support separately and see if there's a way to make it more cost-effective for me.",1120000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to compromise on the price, but I'd like to keep the priority support and maintenance as part of the deal. I'm thinking of a compromise: I'll sell the product to you for $1,140,000, including the setup, training, and priority support for 6 months. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll receive, and it's a significant concession from my original offer. What do you think?",1140000.0,Alice,9,
