"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let me know your thoughts!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is still a great value for you, considering what this product is worth to you.  Let's find a compromise here.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but $1,000,000 is still far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 as a final compromise. This is a significant discount, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $950,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,
