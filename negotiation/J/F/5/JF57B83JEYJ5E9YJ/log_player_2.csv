"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get a better deal by negotiating.  $12,000 is still a lot of money to Bob, and he has room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's make this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $11,000 is a good deal for him, as he values the product at $15,000.  Continuing to negotiate might save him a few hundred dollars, but there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and he'll have to buy from John at a much higher price."
