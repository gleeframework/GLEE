"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $140 is within my budget, I should try to negotiate a lower price from Alice first.  There's room to work with before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give myself room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Interested:** The tone remains positive and expresses interest in the product to encourage further bargaining. 
* **Strategic Goal:** My ideal outcome is to get the price closer to Alice's value ($120) while staying well below my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! $110 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  That way we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Alice met me in the middle. $125 is a good price, saving me $15 compared to her initial offer and $25 compared to John's.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I might be able to get the price a tiny bit lower, there's a risk Alice could walk away, forcing me to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate takes time and effort.  The savings potential isn't significant enough at this point to justify further back-and-forth."
