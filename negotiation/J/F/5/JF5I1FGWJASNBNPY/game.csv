"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer to a price point I'm comfortable with. Could you do $8,700?",8700.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,700 is still a bit low.  I'm willing to go down to $9,200. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider selling to John.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,200 is still a bit rich for me.  How about we split the difference at $8,950? ",8950.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer.  However, I'm not comfortable going any lower than $9,100. If you're serious about this, I'm prepared to accept this price. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to other buyers.",9100.0,Alice,7,
