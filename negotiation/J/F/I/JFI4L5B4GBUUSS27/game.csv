"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,400,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still outside my budget. I'm comfortable offering $1,500,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
