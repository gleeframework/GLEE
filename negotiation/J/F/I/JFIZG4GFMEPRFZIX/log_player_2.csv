"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is tempting, you know you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer doesn't mean you lose the product; it just gives you the chance to secure it for a lower price from your backup option."
