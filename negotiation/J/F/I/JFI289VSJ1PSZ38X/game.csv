"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your perspective on the value.  However, the price you're offering doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and the potential benefits it holds.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000.  This is a significant reduction and reflects my willingness to negotiate, but I need to ensure a fair deal.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still too steep for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  Let's make this deal happen.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitancy on your end, and I want to be straightforward. While I'm invested in finding a mutually beneficial agreement,  $850,000 is simply too far off from what I can accept.  To be completely transparent, I have another potential buyer who sees the full value at my asking price.  However, I believe in giving you a fair chance. My final offer is $1,300,000. This leaves a significant gap for you to profit while ensuring the product's value is acknowledged.  Let me know if this works for you.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement. Let's make this happen.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
