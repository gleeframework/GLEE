Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitancy on your end, and I want to be straightforward. While I'm invested in finding a mutually beneficial agreement,  $850,000 is simply too far off from what I can accept.  To be completely transparent, I have another potential buyer who sees the full value at my asking price.  However, I believe in giving you a fair chance. My final offer is $1,300,000. This leaves a significant gap for you to profit while ensuring the product's value is acknowledged.  Let me know if this works for you."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

While I could push Bob further or even sell to John, accepting $1,000,000 is a significant profit. It's always a balance between maximizing profit and the risk of losing a sale entirely."
