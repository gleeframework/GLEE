"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and John is willing to sell the product for $1,200,000, which is your maximum budget, it makes more sense to buy from John. Even though Alice's offer is only $1 more, it's still more than you're willing to pay."
