Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,800. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,100. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise considering the value this product brings.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has 3 rounds remaining and needs to decide quickly. While Alice is not at the ideal price point, $11,100 is still a good deal compared to the $15,000 option from John. It's likely that Alice won't go lower, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price within his budget and avoids the potential of a higher price from John."
