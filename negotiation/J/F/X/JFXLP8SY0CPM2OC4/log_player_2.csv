"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is higher than both Alice's value and John's offer. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($7,000) than Alice's asking price ($9,500). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Staying Above Alice's Value:** My offer is still above Alice's perceived value of the product ($8,000), making it more likely she'll consider it.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  I'm prepared to negotiate upwards from my initial offer, but I want to see how low Alice is willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,800. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice met me halfway from her original offer, the price of $8,800 is still above her own valuation of the product ($8,000). This suggests there's room for further negotiation. 
* **Targeting Closer to Midpoint:**  I want to try to get the price closer to the midpoint between my initial offer ($7,000) and her current offer ($8,800)."

{
""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate the effort. How about we settle on $7,900? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7900
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards Midpoint:** This offer splits the difference between my previous offer ($7,000) and Alice's current offer ($8,800). 
* **Just Below Alice's Value:**  It's slightly below Alice's perceived value ($8,000), but it might be tempting for her to get a sale rather than risking no deal.
* **Maintaining Negotiation:** I'm still showing willingness to negotiate, but I'm getting closer to my limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to work with me to find a price that works for both of us. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,900 and $9,000, which would be $8,450. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,450. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,450
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice is now offering the product for $8,450, which is a significant saving compared to John's price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Alice has clearly stated her lowest price. Further haggling is unlikely to result in a much better deal and risks losing the product altogether.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate indefinitely has a cost. Accepting this offer allows me to move on and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity."
