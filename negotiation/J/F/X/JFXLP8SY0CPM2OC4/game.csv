"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,800. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate the effort. How about we settle on $7,900? I think that's a fair compromise.",7900.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to work with me to find a price that works for both of us. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,900 and $9,000, which would be $8,450. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",8450.0,Alice,5,
