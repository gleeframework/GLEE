"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product with you. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering both our positions.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value to you is higher than $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving too much value on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the initial offer I made.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I see your point about the value, $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. To reach a deal, I'm willing to offer $1,325,000. This price is fair considering our previous negotiations and reflects the value you've expressed for the product.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see a stronger commitment from you. I'm counteroffering at $1,375,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
