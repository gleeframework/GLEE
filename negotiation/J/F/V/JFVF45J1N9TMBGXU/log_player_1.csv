Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. I know the product is worth at least $120 to me, so I'm not going to settle for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell it to you for $110.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for getting back to me, Alice. I really like the product, but I'm still hoping to keep my spending under $100. Could you possibly lower the price to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm tempted by the $95 offer, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $95 just won't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $105? This is my final offer before I move on to other buyers."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sorry to hear that, Alice. I really wanted to purchase this product from you, but I'm still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. Could you perhaps reconsider and lower the price to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've had several rounds of negotiation with Bob, and it seems we're at an impasse. While I value his interest in the product, I'm not willing to go lower than $105, which is still below my minimum acceptable price. I don't want to risk further rounds with Bob and potentially end up with a lower price than John is offering.  

Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  It's a guaranteed sale and ensures I meet my minimum goal."
