"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. However, I'm open to negotiations and willing to consider your offer if you'd like to make a counteroffer.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd like to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering your minimum and my maximum.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. Considering the value you placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,150,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's try to meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'll counteroffer at $1,160,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value you've expressed.",1160000.0,Alice,5,
