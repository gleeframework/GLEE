Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd like to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering your minimum and my maximum.
