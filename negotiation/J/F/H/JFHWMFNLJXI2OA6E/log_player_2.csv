"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. However, I'm open to negotiations and willing to consider your offer if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum price.** You're not willing to pay more than $1,200,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have a good chance of getting a better price, especially since Alice is already willing to negotiate. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to control the negotiation.** By making a counteroffer, you can start pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd like to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering your minimum and my maximum."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. Considering the value you placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,150,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still above your ideal price.** While it's better than her initial offer, you're still paying more than you want to.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You can likely get the price down further, especially since Alice is willing to compromise.
* **Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going.** By continuing to counteroffer, you have a better chance of securing a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's try to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'll counteroffer at $1,160,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value you've expressed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,160,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,160,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is close to your maximum.**  While it's not your ideal price, it's only $60,000 above your last offer.
* **You've already made significant progress in the negotiation.** You've brought the price down from $1,200,000 to $1,160,000.
* **Continuing to negotiate might not be worth the risk.** You could potentially get a better price, but you also risk losing the deal to John or running out of rounds.

**Overall, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible option at this point. You're securing a good price while minimizing the risk of losing the deal.**"
