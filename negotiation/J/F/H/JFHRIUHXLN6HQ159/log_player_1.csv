"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high with $1,000,000.  This sets a strong initial price point and gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. It's important to remember that Bob's value for the product is unknown, so starting high allows for potential profit maximization."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a good price, it's still below my initial target. I believe there's more room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial $1,000,000 asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm countering with $975,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still closer to my target than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this signals my willingness to negotiate but also shows that I'm not willing to drop my price too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $925,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement, and I don't want to settle for a price that's too low. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and counter with $950,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still staying above his last offer. It's time to see if we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to continue negotiating, we're getting close to the end of our rounds.  With only 4 rounds left,  it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers.  $920,000 is still a significant amount of money, and I'm not willing to risk losing the deal entirely by being too stubborn. I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
