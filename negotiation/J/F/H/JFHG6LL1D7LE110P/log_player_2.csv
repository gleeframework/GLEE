Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500.

Alice is unlikely to come down much further and getting her to $12,000 even is a long shot.  It's time to cut bait and buy from John for the sure price of $12,000."
