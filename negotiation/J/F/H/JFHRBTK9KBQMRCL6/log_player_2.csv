"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's above your maximum budget of $800,000. While it's less than what the product is worth to Alice, it's still not a good deal for you.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice my absolute maximum price. It's the same price I could get from John, so I'm not taking any risk.  This gives Alice a chance to make a deal with me, but it also makes it clear that I'm not willing to pay more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still significantly higher than my budget.  It's worth another round of negotiation to see if I can get her closer to my target price.  If she's unwilling to budge, I can always buy from John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still staying within a reasonable range.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm not going to overpay.  It's also a middle ground between her last offer and my initial offer, which might encourage her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for me. Even though she's lowered her price, it's still a significant amount over my budget.  At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate. Buying from John guarantees me the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
