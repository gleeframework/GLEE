Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the pricing. While $800000 is a fair market value for similar products, this particular product offers unique features and potential that justify a slightly higher price. I'm willing to come down to $900000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
