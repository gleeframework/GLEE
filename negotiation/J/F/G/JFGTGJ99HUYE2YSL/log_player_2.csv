"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $110. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you, and this is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is within your budget, it's still a bit higher than what you're willing to pay.  You want to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. How about $95?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
