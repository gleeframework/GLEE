Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $11,500.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another potential buyer waiting."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning another buyer (""John"") creates a sense of urgency, subtly encouraging Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best price from Bob while not risking losing the sale entirely."
