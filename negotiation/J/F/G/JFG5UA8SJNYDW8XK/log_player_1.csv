Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""value and potential""  justifies the high price, framing it as an investment rather than just a purchase.
* **Exclusivity:**  Using terms like ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a sense of urgency and desirability. 
* **Confidence:** Projecting confidence in the product's worth can influence Bob's perception of its value.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might lower the initial offer slightly.
* **Negotiation Skills:** This offer is a starting point. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You have some leeway as long as you stay above your minimum of $1,200,000."
