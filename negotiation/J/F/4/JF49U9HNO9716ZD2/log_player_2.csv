"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $15,000 is above Bob's maximum price of $12,000. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you highlighting the unique features of the product. However, my budget for this type of item is $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I need to make a living, and $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and hopefully get closer to his target price of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a living, but I'm still not able to go higher than $12,000.  It's my absolute limit for this product.  I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're firm on your budget, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $13500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is getting closer, but it's still above Bob's maximum price point. It's better to keep negotiating and try to get a lower price.  There are still several rounds left, and there's a chance Alice might come down to $12,000. If not, Bob can always buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my reach. My absolute maximum is $12,000. If we can't agree on that, I'll have to explore other options.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that final offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}
