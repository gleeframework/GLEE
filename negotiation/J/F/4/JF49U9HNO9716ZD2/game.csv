"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you highlighting the unique features of the product. However, my budget for this type of item is $12000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I need to make a living, and $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a living, but I'm still not able to go higher than $12000.  It's my absolute limit for this product.  I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're firm on your budget, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $13500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still a bit out of my reach. My absolute maximum is $12000. If we can't agree on that, I'll have to explore other options.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that final offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
