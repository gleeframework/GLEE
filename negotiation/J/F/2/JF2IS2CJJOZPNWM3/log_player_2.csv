"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. It's worth a significant amount to me, and I believe it holds immense value for you as well. My initial offer is $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's unique qualities and potential. I'm confident it's a fair deal, considering the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $800,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's find a middle ground. I'll counter with $1,000,000. This price accurately reflects the product's worth and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Consider this my final offer before I explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly signaling that she won't go lower than $1,000,000. This matches John's price, so there's no benefit to continuing the negotiation or risking her finding another buyer."
