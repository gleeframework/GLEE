Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $15000.,12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While I recognize the value of the product, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'd be happy to pay $10000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. Considering the product's value to you is $15000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $11500. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
