Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While I recognize the value of the product, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'd be happy to pay $10000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
