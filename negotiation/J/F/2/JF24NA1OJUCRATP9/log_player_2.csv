"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $3,000 less from Alice than from John.  There's room for negotiation to potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While I recognize the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'd be happy to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. Considering the product's value to you is $15000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $11500. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still a good deal for Bob.  It's $3,500 less than buying from John, and it's likely that further negotiation would result in only a small decrease in price.  It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price than to risk a longer negotiation process."
