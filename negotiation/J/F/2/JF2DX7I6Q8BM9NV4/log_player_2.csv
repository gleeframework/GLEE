"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  He can likely get the product for a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your position, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. Could we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $13,500 is a good price for the product, and is still within his budget.  He has the option to buy from John for $15,000, so there's no need to risk getting a counteroffer rejected and then needing to buy from John at a higher price."
