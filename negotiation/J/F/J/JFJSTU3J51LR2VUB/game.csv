"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $95? I'm really interested in the product and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $95 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $100.  It's a fair price for both of us and we can finalize the deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
