"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  How about $10,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I value your offer, $9,500 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
