"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. I'm starting with an offer of $1,350,000.  This gives us both a good starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This gives us both a fair price, while still allowing me to reach my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this deal worthwhile. Let's split the difference - how about $1,250,000? This price would still allow you to make a significant profit and would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,175,000. This would be a fair compromise, allowing both of us to walk away with a reasonable deal. ",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I see we're getting closer. While $1,175,000 is tempting, I'm still a bit too far away from my target. How about $1,225,000? This is a reasonable compromise, allowing us both to get a good deal.  Let's make this happen!",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,225,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This would be a fair compromise and would allow us both to close this deal.  Let's make this happen!",1200000.0,Bob,6,
