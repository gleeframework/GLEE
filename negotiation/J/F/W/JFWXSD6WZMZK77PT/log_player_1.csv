I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $80.  I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $85. This is still above my minimum value, but it's a compromise to see if we can find a middle ground."
