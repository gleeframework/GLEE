"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower offer, aiming to get a better deal.  He's offering $10,000, which is still a significant profit for Alice (considering her cost of $8,000). This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while still leaving room for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000.  This gives you a great deal, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get the best price possible. While $11,000 is a better deal than $12,000, he believes he can still negotiate lower. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a price closer to his target of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference at $10,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, but he's also showing a willingness to compromise. He's proposing a price that's halfway between his last offer and Alice's last offer. This shows good faith and could lead to a successful deal in the next round."
