{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value of this product,  $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product is worth more to you than $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $16,000. I've already compromised by meeting you halfway in the previous round. I'm willing to make one more concession: I'll sell the product to you for $16,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,250
