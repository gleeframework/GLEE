Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to haggle the price down.
* **Gauging Interest:**  This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts immediately, you've potentially left money on the table. If he rejects it, you can always negotiate down, knowing you have John as a backup. 
* **Confidence:** Offering a higher price conveys confidence in your product's value. 

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Remember, your goal is to maximize profit, but also to close a deal since you have a guaranteed buyer at $8,000."
