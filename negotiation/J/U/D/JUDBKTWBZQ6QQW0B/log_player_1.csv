Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible, knowing I have a guaranteed buyer at that price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it slightly below my guaranteed price leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially getting me closer to $15,000.
* **Psychological Pricing:** $14,999 feels significantly cheaper than $15,000 to many buyers.

**It's important to note:**  If I were to start too high and Bob rejects, there's no opportunity to negotiate upwards. This strategy prioritizes getting a deal done while maximizing potential profit."
