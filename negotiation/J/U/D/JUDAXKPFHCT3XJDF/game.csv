"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering both our interests. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,250,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This allows for some flexibility while still ensuring a fair return for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm ready to finalize the deal at $1,300,000.
