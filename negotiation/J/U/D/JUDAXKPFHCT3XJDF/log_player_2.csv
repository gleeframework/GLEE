"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this valuable product. My asking price is $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her ($1,500,000), it's still higher than your maximum budget ($1,200,000). You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,250,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This allows for some flexibility while still ensuring a fair return for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. While it's closer to your preferred price, it's still worth rejecting and attempting to negotiate further. You have the option of buying from John for $1,200,000 if you can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Alice."
