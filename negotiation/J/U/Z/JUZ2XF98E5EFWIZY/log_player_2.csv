{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's too early to buy from Alice or John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to start negotiating and see if she's willing to come down in price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

This is a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $300,000. This shows Alice you're serious about buying but also that you're not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is still too high. Rejecting her offer again allows you to see if she'll come down further, and keeps your options open to buy from John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer but still shows Alice you're willing to negotiate.  It's also closer to John's price, making it a more appealing option compared to simply buying from John."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's price is still higher than John's.  Rejecting her offer keeps the pressure on her to come down to a more acceptable price.  You're getting closer to John's price, so the risk of him selling to someone else is lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

This offer is exactly John's price.  Alice has two options: accept and sell at the same price she'd get from John, or reject and risk losing the sale completely. It's time to see if she's willing to accept the market price."
