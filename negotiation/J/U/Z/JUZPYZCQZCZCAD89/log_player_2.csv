"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,100,000 is still above his maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $950,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than he's willing to go.  He should continue to negotiate and see if he can get Alice closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still outside of my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000 yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I still need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $925,000. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should continue to negotiate.  While $925,000 is closer to his budget, he's still within his 10 rounds and could potentially get a better deal. He should try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I understand you need to make a profit, but I can't go any higher than $910,000. This is a good compromise and allows us to both get a fair deal. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 910000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $910,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to think about it for a moment. I'll offer you the product for $917,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $917,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $917,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob is getting close to his limit, and although $917,500 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his target.  It's now time to take the safer option and buy the product from John.  He will save $117,500 by doing so."
