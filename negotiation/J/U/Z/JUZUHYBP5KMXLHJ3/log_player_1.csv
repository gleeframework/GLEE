Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I need to be mindful of the time limit, I know the product is worth more to him than $10,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of the product. How about we meet in the middle? I'll offer it to you for $12,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a price that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round, but I'll also be prepared to sell to John if necessary."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while still giving you a good deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we could reach a midpoint, Alice. Considering the value I place on this product, would it be possible for us to settle at $11,000?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, we're running out of rounds. Accepting his offer ensures I make a profit while also guaranteeing a sale. It's a good compromise in this situation."
