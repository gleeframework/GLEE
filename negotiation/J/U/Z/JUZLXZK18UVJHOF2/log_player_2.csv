It's time to cut negotiations with Alice and go with John.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $800,000, and at this point, the potential savings from further negotiation with Alice are outweighed by the risk of her increasing her price or the negotiation failing altogether.  John offers a sure deal at your target price."
