Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $95 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay up to $85 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $85 is a good price, it's still below my minimum of $80. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we settle on $90? This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for my product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position. I'd like to stick to my previous offer of $85. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, Bob is not willing to budge and the risk of losing this deal and getting only $80 from John is too high.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
