"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob still has room to negotiate and potentially get a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500.  Would you be willing to go that low? "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $11,000 is still better than buying from John for $12,000.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will either reject further counteroffers or become unwilling to negotiate further.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price within his budget and saves him $1,000 compared to John's offer."
