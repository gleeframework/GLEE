"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point that reflects the significant value it holds."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly above your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher final price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 positions it closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) while still providing a comfortable margin above your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""potential worth"" and ""significant value,"" we subtly reinforce the product's desirability without revealing your absolute bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,200,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above your minimum, it's still a significant distance from his perceived value of $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation.  You're willing to negotiate, but not to give up over $100,000 in round 2."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  It shows you're serious.  While I recognize your desired investment level, the value of this product is undeniable. Let's find a middle ground.  Would you consider $1,120,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1120000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** Acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and using phrases like ""find a middle ground"" helps maintain a positive and collaborative atmosphere. 
* **Strategic Concession:**  Lowering the price by $30,000 demonstrates flexibility but also holds firm to a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:** Reiterating the product's value subtly reminds Bob of its worth and justifies the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still aiming to keep my investment within $1,200,000. Could we possibly agree on $1,080,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving upward, which is a positive sign. However, the increments are getting smaller. We are still far from a price that reflects the potential profit, especially considering Bob values it at $1,200,000. Holding firm for another round maintains pressure and explores if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. It seems we both see the inherent value in this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the product's potential."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:** Acknowledging Bob's negotiating efforts helps build rapport and encourages him to continue the process.
* **Significant Concession:** Dropping the price by $20,000 signals a willingness to move towards a deal, but the amount remains strategically chosen to maximize potential profit. 
* **Value Reminder:**  Reiterating the product's ""potential"" subtly encourages Bob to consider the larger picture and the potential return on his investment. 
* **Time Consideration:** We are past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. This offer aims to strike a balance between securing a strong price and avoiding a stalemate that could lead to missing out on both Bob and John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $1,070,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value:** With only four rounds remaining, the risk of Bob walking away increases. Accepting now secures a significant profit without jeopardizing the deal entirely. 
* **Profitable Outcome:**  $1,070,000 is a strong price, exceeding your minimum acceptable price by a healthy margin. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob's counteroffers are getting smaller.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better price, especially considering the risk of Bob walking away and losing both offers."
