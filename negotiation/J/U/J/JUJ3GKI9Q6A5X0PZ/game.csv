"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $1350000?",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1350000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1400000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $1300000, but I think we can do better than that. Can we try $1250000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1250000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1380000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",1380000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go above $1250000. I think that's a fair price for this product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on that price. Can you accept my offer of $1250000?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
