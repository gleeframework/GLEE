,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we say $110?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we settle on $100? That would be a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $100 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we say $115?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm serious about buying this product, but $115 is pushing my budget. I can offer you $105 as my final price. If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",105.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $110, but I need to make a profit. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. How about we say $110?",110.0,Alice,7,
