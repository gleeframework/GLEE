"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

We're starting with a counteroffer slightly above Alice's value. This approach leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well below our $150 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, but $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we say $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate. We'll reject this offer and try to nudge the price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we settle on $100? That would be a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

We're proposing a price that splits the difference between our previous offer and Alice's counteroffer. This keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a favorable price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $100 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we say $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is holding firm, but the price difference is getting smaller. We'll reject this offer and try one more time to reach a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm serious about buying this product, but $115 is pushing my budget. I can offer you $105 as my final price. If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're making it clear this is our final offer while remaining polite and expressing a genuine interest in the product.
* **Slight Concession:** Offering $105 is a slight increase from our previous offer, showing we're willing to compromise.
* **Alternative Option:** Mentioning ""other options"" subtly reminds Alice that we have a backup plan (John) if the negotiation fails. 

This counteroffer puts the ball in Alice's court and sets a clear boundary for our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $110, but I need to make a profit. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. How about we say $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reasonable Price:** $110 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly lower than John's $150 offer and closer to our target price.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're running down the clock. While we could push further, there's a risk Alice won't budge and we'll end up with a worse deal.
* **Alice's Firmness:** Alice has repeatedly indicated that $110 is her bottom line. It's unlikely she'll go any lower. 

Accepting this offer secures a good price and avoids the risk of a negotiation breakdown."
