"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price closer to $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $110?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $115. Would you be willing to go down to $105? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.,105.0,Bob,4,
