"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,000,000? This reflects the true value of the product while still being a good deal for you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",950000.0,Bob,4,
