Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm offering it to you at a special price of $11,500. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum perceived value without going below our minimum acceptable price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Why not other prices?**

* **$12,000 or higher:**  Bob is unlikely to accept a price at or above our guaranteed sale price to John.
* **$8,000 - $10,000:** While this range is tempting to ensure a sale, it leaves significant potential profit on the table."
