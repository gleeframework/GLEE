Round 3

# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Alice has moved closer to my target price. I want to see if I can get her down further. I'm still within my budget and have plenty of rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $11,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, and we can finalize this quickly."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,250, which is just within my budget and a good deal. I've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and it's likely that continuing to bargain will only lead to more back-and-forth.  This is a fair price, and I'm happy to accept it."
