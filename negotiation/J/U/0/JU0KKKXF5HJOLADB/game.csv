"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $900,000 is significantly lower than what I value this product at. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still leaves some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I'm getting close to my maximum budget, so I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,
