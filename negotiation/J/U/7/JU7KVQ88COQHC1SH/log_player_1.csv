"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes the potential benefits for both parties.
* **Leaving the door open:** The message ends with an open question to encourage Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).** While it's closer to my target, I'm not willing to accept a price that doesn't at least match my minimum.
* **I have 9 rounds left.**  I have ample opportunity to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John is always an option.** If I can't reach a deal with Bob, I can still sell to John for my minimum acceptable price. This provides a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective on the market value, my product is unique and offers exceptional benefits.

Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counteroffer that's closer to his price point. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the unique value and benefits of the product to justify the price.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm focusing on finding a price that works for both of us, emphasizing a collaborative approach.
* **Remaining Firm:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that your product is unique and offers exceptional benefits, but I still think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,400,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my new offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).**  While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to settle for anything less than my minimum.
* **I have 6 rounds left.** There's still time to try and get a better price from Bob. 
* **Selling to John is still an option.** If I can't get a better deal with Bob, I can always sell to John and secure my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,400,000 is still below my minimum price point. I'm willing to make one final adjustment and offer the product for $1,550,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value and uniqueness of my product. I hope you'll reconsider and accept this offer."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Adjustment:** This counteroffer is a significant concession, but it still remains above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasize Value and Concession:** I'm reiterating the product's value and emphasizing that I'm making a considerable concession.
* **Urgency:** I'm creating a sense of urgency by suggesting this is my ""final adjustment.""
* **Negotiation Flexibility:** I'm leaving the door open for a potential final round of negotiation if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make another adjustment, but $1,550,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,450,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market conditions. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).**  
* **We are down to our last 4 rounds.** The likelihood of Bob increasing his offer to my minimum acceptable price within the remaining rounds is low.
* **Selling to John guarantees my minimum price.**  While I would like to get a higher price, I'm not willing to risk losing out on a sale by continuing to negotiate with Bob. John is a reliable buyer who will pay my minimum acceptable price. 

It's better to secure the sale with John and ensure a guaranteed profit than to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with nothing."
