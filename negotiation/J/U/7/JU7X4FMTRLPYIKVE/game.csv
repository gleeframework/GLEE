"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for a product of this quality. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $11,000, which would be $10,250. Can you consider that?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,750,  which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",10750.0,Alice,5,
