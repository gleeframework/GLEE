"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and still a good profit for me. Let me know your thoughts!

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
