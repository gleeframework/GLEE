"Round 1

# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's offer is overpriced. We should try to negotiate a better price closer to our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only justify spending $1,100,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly worth more. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice's offer has come down significantly, it's still above our ideal price and what John is offering. We have room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to a point where I can agree, but $1,400,000 is still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $1,250,000? I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 still falls short of what this product is worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1,375,000. Let's try to finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is moving closer to our range, but we're not in a hurry. Let's see if we can push her a little further down before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, it seems like we're getting close on the price.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000 to try and finalize this today.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I truly appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,350,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value you'll get. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice seems firm at $1,350,000, and she's indicated it's her final offer.  While we could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely we'll get a significant price drop at this point.  John's offer of $1,500,000 is now a better deal, saving us $150,000."
