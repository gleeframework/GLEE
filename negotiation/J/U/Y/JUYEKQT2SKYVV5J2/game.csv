,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only justify spending $1,100,000.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly worth more. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to a point where I can agree, but $1,400,000 is still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $1,250,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 still falls short of what this product is worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1,375,000. Let's try to finalize this deal.",1375000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,350,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value you'll get. Let's close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
