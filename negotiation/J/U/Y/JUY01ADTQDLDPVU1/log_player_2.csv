"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high. It's in your best interest to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save a significant amount of money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price, it's still higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating. I can either make another counteroffer or simply buy from John for $800,000, which is a guaranteed price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to make another concession, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product and the fact that you're willing to pay $850,000, I'm now offering it to you for $900,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  At this point, the negotiation has become a bit drawn out, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get her to go any lower. To avoid further negotiation, it's in my best interest to simply purchase the product from John for the guaranteed price of $800,000."
