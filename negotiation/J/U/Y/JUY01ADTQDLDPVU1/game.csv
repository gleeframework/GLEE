"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $800,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down in price.  I really appreciate that.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm happy to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it's within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to make another concession, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product and the fact that you're willing to pay $850,000, I'm now offering it to you for $900,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",900000.0,Alice,5,
