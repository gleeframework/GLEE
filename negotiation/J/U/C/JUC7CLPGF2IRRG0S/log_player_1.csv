Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,190,000. This offer reflects the significant value it holds."", 
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,000,000) as possible while still exceeding your minimum selling price ($1,200,000).
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering a price slightly below John's guaranteed offer ($1,200,000) allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still ensuring a profitable outcome for you. 
* **Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the offer as exclusive to Bob, potentially making him more inclined to accept.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk that Bob might reject the offer. However, having John as a backup buyer ensures you'll sell the product at your desired price."
