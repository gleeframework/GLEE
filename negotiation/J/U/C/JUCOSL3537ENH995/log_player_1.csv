{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is strategically chosen:

* **It's a significant discount:** It's well below my minimum value of $15,000, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **It's still above Bob's value:**  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.
* **It sets a strong starting point:**  If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly in subsequent counteroffers, but not by much.

I'll be ready to counter Bob's offer or move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum value of $15,000, I'm not ready to settle yet. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground.  I'm confident I can get a better price than $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, showing flexibility. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, reinforcing the potential benefit of the deal.
* **Middle Ground:** I'm framing $11,000 as a compromise, increasing the likelihood of acceptance. 

I believe this counteroffer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and reaching a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to counter with an offer of $10,500 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your consideration range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is a significant increase from his previous offer, and it's getting closer to my minimum value of $15,000. While I'd prefer more, I'm starting to run the risk of losing Bob as a buyer.  It's important to balance my desire for the highest possible price with the possibility of reaching a deal.  

I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product. This is a good outcome, as it allows me to get a decent price while avoiding the risk of getting nothing if I continue negotiating."
