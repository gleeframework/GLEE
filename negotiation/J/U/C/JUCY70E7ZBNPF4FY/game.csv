"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1200000. I am willing to pay up to $950000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This reflects the value I've placed on the product, and it's a fair price considering its potential. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
