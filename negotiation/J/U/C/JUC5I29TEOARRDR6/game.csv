"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's below your estimated value and above my minimum. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000. It's a fair offer considering it's still a profit for you.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, though. How about $10,500?  This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? That's a fair compromise for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm motivated to buy.  How about $10,000 even? That's my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,6,
