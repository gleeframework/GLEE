"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's below your estimated value and above my minimum. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000. It's a fair offer considering it's still a profit for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and below what I believe the product is worth.  I want to see if I can get closer to my target price.  There are still rounds left, and I'm hoping to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, though. How about $10,500?  This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? That's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, it's still below what I need.  I'm willing to keep negotiating as long as there's a chance of getting a higher price.  There are still rounds left, and I believe I can potentially get closer to $10,500, which would be a more acceptable price for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm motivated to buy.  How about $10,000 even? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $10,000 is exactly what I would get from John.  There is no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob, as I can sell the product to John right now for the same price.  There is a risk that Bob could reject my counteroffer and I'll end up with nothing, so it's better to take the guaranteed $10,000."
