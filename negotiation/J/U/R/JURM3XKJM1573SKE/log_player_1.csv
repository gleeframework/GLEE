Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($80), while still being potentially attractive to Bob who values the product at $150. This allows room for negotiation while giving you a solid starting position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than the initial offer and leaves room for further negotiation. It's worth trying to get closer to the desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still maintaining a higher price point than his initial proposal. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while aiming for a price that is closer to your desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is a fair compromise. It's higher than selling to John and significantly closer to your desired price point. Accepting this offer ensures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price."
