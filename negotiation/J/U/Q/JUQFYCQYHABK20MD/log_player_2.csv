# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** While Alice's price is higher than the product's worth to her ($80), it's still lower than what you would pay John ($100).
* **You want to save money:** Accepting Alice's offer saves you $10 compared to buying from John."
