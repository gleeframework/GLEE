Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""immense value and potential,"" aiming to justify the high price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, I signal my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price. 

This strategy allows me to potentially secure a much higher price than my minimum while always having the option to fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my research and understanding of the market value, I'd be willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While he's expressing a willingness to negotiate, accepting his initial offer would mean a substantial loss.  I believe there's room to negotiate further and potentially reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers unique advantages, and I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but standing firm on my valuation.  By stating this is my final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's benefits and potential profitability for Bob, aiming to justify the price.
* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a substantial concession from my initial price, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. However, the new price is still significantly above Bob's offer and provides a comfortable margin above my minimum.

This approach aims to strike a balance between firmness and flexibility, increasing the chances of securing a favorable deal without dragging negotiations on for too long."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1,900,000 is still above my limit. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair price given my research and my willingness to close this deal. I hope you'll consider this final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's final offer of $1,400,000 is still below my initial target, it's now above my guaranteed sale price with John. Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a worse outcome or a stalemate."
