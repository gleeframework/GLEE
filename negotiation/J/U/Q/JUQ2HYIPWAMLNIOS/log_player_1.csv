**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $1,450,000 is a good starting point. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly but firm, emphasizing the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming to secure a price close to the midpoint between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to counter with a lower price or sell to John."
