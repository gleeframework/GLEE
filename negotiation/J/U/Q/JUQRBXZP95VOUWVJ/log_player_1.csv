Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 950000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you get a good price. It's also above John's offer, so you're not taking a loss if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's better than selling to John, it's still significantly below your desired price and the product's value to Bob.  It's worth trying to get a better price through another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer, showing you're willing to negotiate, but still significantly lower than your initial offer. This keeps the pressure on Bob while acknowledging his willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now below your minimum acceptable price and significantly lower than John's offer. It's time to cut your losses and accept the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
