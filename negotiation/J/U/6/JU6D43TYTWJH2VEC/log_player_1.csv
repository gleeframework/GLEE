"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm happy to offer it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation and see if Bob is seriously interested.
* **Adding a Message:** A friendly message helps build rapport and shows I'm open to negotiation. 
* **First Round Strategy:** In the first round, it's better to err on the side of a higher price to see if Bob is willing to play."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. I'd like to propose a price of $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'm not desperate to sell, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer gives me more leverage to push for a higher price.
* **Seeking a Better Deal:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $110, as the product is worth more to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $95 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $102.50? This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 102.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a middle ground price between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify my price point.
* **Positive Tone:** My message is polite and encourages Bob to consider my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $97 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $97 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $110. 
* **Leveraging John:**  I have the option to sell to John for $100, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's offer just yet.

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $97 is still a little too low for me. Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $99.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows you to get a great deal."", ""product_price"": 99}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Almost There:** I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Middle Ground:** $99 is a midpoint between my previous offer of $102.50 and Bob's current offer of $97. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm still highlighting the value of the product to justify my price. 
* **Motivating Bob:** By framing it as a ""fair price and a great deal,"" I'm trying to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
