"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you've mentioned. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. Can you consider my offer?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While $10,000 is appealing, the product's value is significantly higher.  How about we settle at $13,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,

I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $11,500. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value and my budget constraints. Can you consider my offer?",11500.0,Bob,4,
