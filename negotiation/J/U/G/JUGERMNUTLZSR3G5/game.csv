"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing the price further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to  $600,000. ",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? ",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'd like to offer you a price of $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to discussing the details of the sale.",850000.0,Alice,5,
