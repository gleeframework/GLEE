Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down, while still keeping the price significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Time Pressure:** The 24-hour limit creates urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quicker and avoid missing out. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly during negotiations with Bob. However, never go below your $800,000 minimum, as you have a guaranteed buyer in John."
