"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it for a price that's fair for both of us.  Would you be interested in paying $100 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Your Value:** The product is worth $120 to you.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering it for $100.
* **John's Price:** John is selling it for $120.

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $20 compared to buying from John.  While you could try to negotiate with Alice, there's no guarantee you'll get a better price, and you risk losing the deal entirely."
