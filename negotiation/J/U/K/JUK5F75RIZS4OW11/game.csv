"I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a great price for this product.  Let's make a deal.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $95?,95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $95 is still just a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $97.50.  This is a fair price for both of us and a great deal for you.",97.5,Alice,5,

I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $92?,92.0,Bob,6,
