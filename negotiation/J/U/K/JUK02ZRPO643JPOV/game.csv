"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else.",180.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'd be willing to pay $130 for it.  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still a little too much for me. I'm happy to meet you at $145. This feels like a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'll get great use out of this product. What do you think?",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $160 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to come down another $5 and offer it to you for $155. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really hoping to get this product, but I can't quite justify $155.  Would you be willing to come down just a bit more to $150?  This would make it a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we could finalize the deal.",150.0,Bob,6,
