"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price of $850,000. It's a steal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

It's worth negotiating with Alice to try and get a better price.  $850,000 is still over your budget."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  I'm willing to accept $800,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's close this deal!

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, and you can get the product without further negotiation. Buying from John would be the same price, so this is the best option."
