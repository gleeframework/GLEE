"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy the product for $750,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer, as I'm not willing to accept a price that is lower than the value I've set for the product. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  I'm willing to accept $800,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's close this deal! "", ""product_price"": 800000}
