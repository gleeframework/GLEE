"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy the product for $750,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  I'm willing to accept $800,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's close this deal! ",800000.0,Alice,3,
