Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $700,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?"",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $875,000 is still a little high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, but we're still significantly above our minimum acceptable price (and John's offer). There's room for negotiation, and I believe we can get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a price that works for you, and I want to make this deal happen. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $812,500?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, you're right, I'm very keen to make a deal.  How about we settle at $780,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to John's, we are still in a position to negotiate. Bob is clearly motivated, and we have a few rounds to spare to try and get a slightly better deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this purchase and I respect that. Let's close this gap. How about $795,000? This reflects my desire to work with you while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm ready to close this deal, but I need it to work for me.  My final offer is $785,000.  Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $785,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob has signaled that $785,000 is his final offer. While we could continue to negotiate, it's unlikely we'll be able to close the gap significantly enough to justify the risk of losing both offers. John's offer of $800,000 is now more attractive as it guarantees a sale at a price very close to Bob's best offer."
