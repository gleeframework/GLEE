``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me a good margin above my minimum value and leaves room for potential negotiation. It's important to start high, as I can always lower the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's my minimum acceptable price, I'm hoping to get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $1,300,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from my initial offer.  It gives me a good chance of getting a deal while still ensuring a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $1,250,000 is a good deal and ensures I get a profit. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal and forcing me to settle for the lower price from John."
