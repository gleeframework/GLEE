,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is too far below my desired price. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still leaves you a good profit margin, and it's a fair deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for us. Let's aim for something in the middle. How about $10,250? That's a fair compromise, and it still gives you a good profit. Let's try to reach a deal this round.",10250.0,Alice,5,
