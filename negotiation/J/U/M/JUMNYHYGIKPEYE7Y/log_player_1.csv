Bob's offer is too low. I will reject it and counter offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is too far below my desired price. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still leaves you a good profit margin, and it's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

While Bob's offer is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not comfortable selling for that low.  I'll counteroffer again and try to push him higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for us. Let's aim for something in the middle. How about $10,250? That's a fair compromise, and it still gives you a good profit. Let's try to reach a deal this round."", ""product_price"": 10250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we settle at $10,000 even?  That's a nice, round number we can both feel good about. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum price, but I've already gone through 5 rounds of negotiation.  I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob in the remaining rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $10,000."
