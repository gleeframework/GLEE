"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it's only fair to present this opportunity at a price reflecting its true value. We're offering it to you for $750,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price. You have 10 rounds and a backup option with John, so you can afford to be a little more aggressive in your negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. To move forward, we propose an offer of $725,000 for the product. This reflects a middle ground between our initial proposal and your counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is showing some flexibility, but you can likely still push for a better price. You have a strong fallback option with John, so it's worth continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit hesitant at $725,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $712,500? This would allow us both to move forward efficiently."", ""product_price"": 712500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your latest proposal, we are willing to consider $717,500 as a fair price for the product. This reflects a slight adjustment towards your offer while still valuing the product at its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $717,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $717,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and you're only $17,500 away from your ideal price. It's risky to continue negotiating, as you might end up with a worse price or run out of rounds. Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice at this point."
