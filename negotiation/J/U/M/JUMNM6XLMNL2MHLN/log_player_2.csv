"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is within my budget, but I want to try and negotiate a lower price. I can potentially save money by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer.  Since John's offer is my absolute limit, rejecting Alice's offer doesn't risk me losing out on the product."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me for this product. I'm interested, but I'd need to come in a bit lower to make this work for me.  How about $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob! I understand that you're trying to negotiate a good deal. However, I have to say that $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,300,000 for this product. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is still a better price than John's offer, but I'm still hoping to get a lower price. I'll reject this offer and make a new counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,250,000. I think this product is worth every penny, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you be willing to consider $1,225,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is a good price, and I'm confident I won't get a better deal from her. It's still significantly lower than John's offer of $1,500,000.  While I might be able to negotiate a few dollars lower, I don't want to risk losing the deal.  It's time to accept Alice's offer and secure the purchase."
