"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me for this product. I'm interested, but I'd need to come in a bit lower to make this work for me.  How about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob! I understand that you're trying to negotiate a good deal. However, I have to say that $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,300,000 for this product. Would you be willing to consider that price?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm ready to move forward with this purchase, but I can only go up to $1,150,000. If you're willing to accept that price, I'm ready to make the deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,250,000. I think this product is worth every penny, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you be willing to consider $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,5,
