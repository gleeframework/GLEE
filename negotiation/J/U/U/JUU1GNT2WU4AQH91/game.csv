"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a little out of my range.  I'm happy to pay $9,000, which is closer to what I can afford.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which is $9,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you'll consider it.",9750.0,Alice,5,
