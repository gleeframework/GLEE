"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $7,500 is tempting, it's a bit lower than I'm hoping to achieve. Let's compromise. How about $8,000? That's a fair price, and it ensures both of us get a good deal.",8000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a little hesitant to go lower than $7,900. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied. Would you consider this?",7900.0,Alice,5,
