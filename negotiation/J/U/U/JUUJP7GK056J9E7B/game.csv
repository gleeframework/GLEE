"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's something that I've personally valued at over a million dollars, and I know it could do the same for your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1050000.  This is a fair price, considering the value it brings, and allows for a mutually beneficial arrangement.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
