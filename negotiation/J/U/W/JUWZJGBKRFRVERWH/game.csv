"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. While I see its value, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which I think is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $11,000 is still a bit outside my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident I can get good use out of this product.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,750 is still just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250, which is a fair compromise.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.  Let's finalize this deal!",11250.0,Alice,5,
