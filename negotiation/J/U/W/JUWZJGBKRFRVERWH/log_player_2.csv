# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice since the product is worth less to you than her offer.  You can try a counteroffer and see if you can get closer to your $10,000 target."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. While I see its value, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which I think is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $11,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still slightly higher than your budget. It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $11,000 is still a bit outside my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident I can get good use out of this product."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,750 is still just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250, which is a fair compromise.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.  Let's finalize this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

Alice's final offer of $11,250 is still above your budget of $10,000.  You've made a good effort to negotiate, but it's time to move on to a more favorable option.  John is offering the same product for $10,000, which fits within your budget and saves you money."
