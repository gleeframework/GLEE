{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $11,500 is still more than what Bob is willing to pay, giving him room to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're still above your minimum of $12,000, leaving room for you to lower the price if needed. 
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** By offering a price that's not your absolute minimum, you show flexibility and encourage Bob to engage in a conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. While I see its value, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:**  While it's tempting to take the $10,500, it's below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **You have a better alternative:** You have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $12,000.  
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can make a counteroffer that may still be acceptable to Bob and closer to your desired price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you keep the negotiation open and aim for a higher price. You're not obligated to sell to Bob, so you can leverage your other options to get a better deal."
