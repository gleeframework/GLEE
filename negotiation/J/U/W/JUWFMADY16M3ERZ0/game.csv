"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,200,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a considerable compromise and a very strong offer for a product of this caliber.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,650,000? This is my final offer, as I do have other interested parties.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other interested parties, but $1,650,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a significant compromise for me, and I hope you'll consider it.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
