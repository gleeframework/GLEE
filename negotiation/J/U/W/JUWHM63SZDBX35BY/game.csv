"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I would like to make a counteroffer at $175, trying to find a middle ground between the original price and your offer. This still reflects the product's high quality and value, while being more accessible to your budget. I hope this revised price works for you. Please let me know your thoughts.",175.0,Alice,3,
