Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and potential. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation and potentially maximize my profit.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for the price, highlighting the product's value and potential. This can help Bob understand my perspective.
* **Open-ended Question:** The question ""What are your thoughts?"" encourages Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I can gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay. If he rejects, I can adjust my price down based on his counteroffer. However, I have the safety net of John's offer at $800,000 to ensure I don't sell the product for less than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product. However, I am looking for a more reasonable price. How about we aim for $800000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee that I'll get a better price.  Selling to John immediately guarantees me the minimum value I'm comfortable with, and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
