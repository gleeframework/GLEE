"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $13,000? This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to make a decent profit. Let me know if you're interested.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,800, which is the highest I can go. Can you consider this offer?",12800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm very close to accepting it.  However, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my desired price.  How about $12,900? It's only $100 more than your offer, and it allows me to make a small profit.  Let me know what you think.",12900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a small profit, but I'm really close to my budget limit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $12,700. This is the best I can do. Can you consider this offer?",12700.0,Bob,6,
