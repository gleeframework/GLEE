"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. This product would be useful, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. However, $18,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you be willing to consider $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, $13,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  Could you meet me at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, we're getting closer! I can see you're firm on the value, but I have to stick to my budget.  How about $14,000? That's my final offer.",14000.0,Bob,6,
