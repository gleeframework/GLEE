The product is worth $80 to me. Alice's offer of $150 is too high. I will reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer of $120 is still too high for me. I'm not willing to pay more than $80 for this product. I'll go ahead and buy it from John."
