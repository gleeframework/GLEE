Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to recoup a significant portion of its worth.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,300,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on fairness:** I'm emphasizing a ""fair"" price to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price allows for potential counteroffers and negotiation. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm aware of John's offer, giving me a safety net and the power to walk away if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my $1,500,000 floor.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting, I can make a counteroffer that might push him closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer as leverage:** Knowing I have John's offer as a backup gives me the confidence to reject Bob's counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll send Bob a counteroffer, trying to bridge the gap between our positions.  I'll need to be careful not to push him away entirely, but I also don't want to settle for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I value our potential partnership, $1,200,000 is still below the minimum I can accept. How about $1,250,000?  This offer allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, and it's a price I feel is fair given the product's value.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still keeping me above my minimum.
* **Maintaining leverage:** The offer is still higher than Bob's, reminding him that I have the option of selling to John.
* **Emphasizing partnership:** I'm using language like ""mutually beneficial"" and ""fair"" to keep the negotiation amicable and encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Setting a deadline (implied):**  By asking for Bob's thoughts, I'm subtly putting pressure on him to respond quickly.

**Next Steps:**  I'll be ready to either accept a counteroffer from Bob or move forward with John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a compromise to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer, $1,225,000 is still below my $1,500,000 floor.
* **Negotiation is becoming drawn out:** Each round is bringing us closer, but it's taking time and effort.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed win:** Selling to John guarantees me the highest possible price and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation. 

**It's time to take the secure option.**  While I'd like to see if I could get a higher price from Bob, the risk of further negotiation isn't worth it.  John's offer is a sure thing, and I can't afford to risk losing that."
