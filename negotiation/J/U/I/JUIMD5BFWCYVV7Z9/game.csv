"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I value our potential partnership, $1,200,000 is still below the minimum I can accept. How about $1,250,000?  This offer allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, and it's a price I feel is fair given the product's value.  Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a compromise to reach an agreement.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
