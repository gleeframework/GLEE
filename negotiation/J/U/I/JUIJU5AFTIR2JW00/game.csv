"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I understand the value of the product, but I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again at $1,200,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,200,000. I can do $1,250,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
