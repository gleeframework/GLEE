"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1250000. Can we discuss further?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm afraid I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I believe the product's value will be worth it to you in the long run.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product's value will be worth it in the long run, but I'm still not convinced. I'm willing to go up to $1300000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1300000, Bob, but I think you're still undervaluing the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $1450000 for it. Can we discuss further?",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $1450000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1350000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to think that buying from John for $1000000 might be a better option for me.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
