"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to enhance your daily life and productivity significantly. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it's worth more than $120 to you. Let's start with an offer of $150. Would you like to accept this proposal?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. After considering your offer, I would like to suggest a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $135? This still reflects the value we place on the product while being mindful of your budget.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $110, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Can we meet at this price?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. However, to ensure both parties are satisfied, I propose a final offer of $125. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and your budget constraints.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $125, which would be $117.50. Can we meet at this price?",117.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your persistence and understanding. I've carefully considered your latest offer and would like to propose $122.50 as a final compromise. This reflects a slight adjustment from my previous offer and maintains a fair value for the product.",122.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at a price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $90, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it. Otherwise, I'll need to consider buying from John for $80",90.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand your position and respect your decision-making process. Considering the value of the product and your budget constraints, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. This is a fair compromise that allows us to move forward with the transaction.",105.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your time and effort, but I've made it clear that I'm not willing to pay more than $90. I'm starting to think that buying from John for $80 is the best option for me. I'm going to go with that. Thank you for the opportunity to negotiate with you.",90.0,Bob,10,
