Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer myself.  I'm always aware of John's offer of $1,200,000, so I won't accept any offer lower than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob at $975,000. This is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and his counteroffer. It's still higher than Bob's perceived value, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $920,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident that John will buy the product for $1,200,000, so I'll choose to sell to him."
