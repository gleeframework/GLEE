This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him some room to negotiate, but it's also lower than your minimum, allowing for potential profit."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1000000 for this product.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $1,000,000 is a lot of money, it's far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my goal."
