"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my budget.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $950,000 is certainly a step in the right direction, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price allows for a significant gain for you and still ensures a good return for me. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while allowing me to stay within my financial limits. Let's aim for a deal that benefits both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
