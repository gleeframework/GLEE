"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $10,500. It's the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $9,000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,500 is close, but I have a strict budget. My final offer is $9,250.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to consider other options.",9250.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're really close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession. I can offer it to you for $9,500 was a bit high, so I'm willing to meet you at $9,000 was a bit low, so I'm willing to meet you at $9,375. It's a compromise, but I think it's fair considering the value of the product.",9375.0,Alice,7,
