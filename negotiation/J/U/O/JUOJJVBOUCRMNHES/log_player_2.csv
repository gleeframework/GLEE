# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you based on your needs and preferences. Given its high value and quality, we're offering it to you at an exclusive price of $100. This is a special opportunity tailored just for you, considering the significant worth you place on this product. I look forward to hearing your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $100 is less than John's price of $120, you can still try to negotiate a better deal. There's room for you to counter-offer and potentially get the product for a price closer to Alice's perceived value of $80."
