Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a decent profit. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John for the guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to sell for $100, as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}

I'm offering $175, which is still a good profit for me but closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage him to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price, and I'm happy to accept it. While I could try for a higher price, there's no guarantee that Bob will come up further. This ensures a sale and a profit."
