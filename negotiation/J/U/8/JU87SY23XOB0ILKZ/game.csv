"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me and the potential for a quick sale. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. Considering the product's worth to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $16,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair reflection of its value to me.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to go below $16,000. I'll meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $15,500. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While I'm getting closer to your asking price, $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,500. This offer is a good compromise, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product to me.",14500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,500. I'll make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $15,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",15000.0,Alice,7,
