"Hey Alice, $90 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $75 right now. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  Would you be interested in that?",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $85 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $80? It's a fair price for both of us, and I can close the deal right now.",80.0,Bob,4,
