(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate with her before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This will give us room to negotiate while still leaving potential for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above my maximum budget. While it's tempting to accept since it's close, I'm going to continue negotiating. There's a good chance I can get the price down a bit more with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round.  This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a better deal.  It's also a good middle ground between my previous offer and her last offer, which could make it more appealing for her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get the price down to $10,000.  If it doesn't work, I'll buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. It's my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. If Alice rejects this offer, I will purchase from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my maximum budget.  We've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to lead to a price I'm willing to pay. It's time to move on and secure the product from John at my pre-determined maximum price."
