"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, given the market value and my budget. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the market value, the product's intrinsic worth and potential benefits warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This offer reflects the true value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $2,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,750,000. This is the maximum I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
