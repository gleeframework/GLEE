Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's counteroffer of $925,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to your target price of $850,000 and still saves you a significant amount compared to buying from John. At this point, it's likely that further negotiation won't result in a significantly lower price. It's better to accept the offer and secure the product."
