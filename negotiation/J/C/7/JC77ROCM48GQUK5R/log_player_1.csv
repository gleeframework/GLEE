"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a fair starting point, considering the product is worth $100 to Bob. I believe this price leaves room for negotiation while still allowing me to earn more than my minimum desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I still have plenty of rounds left to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm countering with $105. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still ensuring I get a price above my minimum. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while remaining firm on my value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to my minimum desired price of $100.  Since I have limited rounds and John is willing to pay $100, I'm going to accept Bob's offer to secure a sale."
