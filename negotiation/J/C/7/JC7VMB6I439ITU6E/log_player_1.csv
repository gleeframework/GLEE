Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing the price further."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($2,000,000 vs. $1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. This may make Bob perceive subsequent offers as more reasonable, even if they are still above his initial valuation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message explicitly mentions being ""open to discussing the price further."" This signals flexibility and encourages Bob to engage in negotiation, increasing the chances of finding a mutually agreeable price above the $1,500,000 backup offer.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale to John at $1,500,000. This knowledge allows Alice to be more assertive in her initial ask.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit but assumes Alice has some leverage in the negotiation (e.g., the product is unique, in high demand, or Bob needs it urgently)."
