"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this [product description] and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $150 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay $150 for the product from John, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  Rejecting her offer keeps the possibility open that Alice might lower her price to be more competitive, or you can move forward with John's offer."
