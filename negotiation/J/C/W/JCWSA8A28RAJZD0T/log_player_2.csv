"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm aiming to stay within my budget of $800,000. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is a significant drop from her initial offer. This is close to Bob's budget and still provides a potential for a good return on investment. Accepting this offer would secure the product at a reasonable price, and further negotiation may not lead to a significantly better outcome. While buying from John for $800,000 is tempting, accepting this offer from Alice allows Bob to secure a product that's likely worth more than his maximum budget."
