"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our flagship product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs and exceed your expectations. This product is truly a game-changer in its field, offering unparalleled benefits that align perfectly with your requirements. Given its exceptional value and quality, we believe it's worth more than $15,000 to you. However, considering our commitment to making high-quality products accessible, I am offering you the opportunity to acquire this product at an exclusive price of $12,000. This is a special offer tailored specifically for you, reflecting both the product's worth and our desire to establish a long-term relationship with you. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's flowery language is designed to make the product seem incredibly valuable, you know your upper limit is $15,000. Her starting price of $12,000 is still a significant markup from the $8,000 she values it at.  By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're not willing to be pushed over your budget. There's a good chance she'll come back with a lower offer, giving you the opportunity to save more money."
