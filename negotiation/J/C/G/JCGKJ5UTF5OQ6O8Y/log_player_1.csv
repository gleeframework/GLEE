Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my interest.  While the product's potential is exciting,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which reflects the product's value to me and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
