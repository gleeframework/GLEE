"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my interest.  While the product's potential is exciting,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which reflects the product's value to me and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  While I'm motivated to sell, I believe the product's true value warrants a higher price.  Would you consider $900,000?  This still allows you a substantial return on your investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm firm on $875,000, which is a fair compromise considering our positions.  I'm eager to finalize this deal, so let me know your thoughts.",875000.0,Bob,4,
