Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000** is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, making it attractive to Bob. 
* **$14,000** is still above Bob's perceived value of $12,000, giving me room for negotiation.
* The message is friendly and emphasizes a fair price, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I want to see if I can squeeze out a little more from Bob.  I'm confident that I can get a better offer by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $13,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. How about $13,500? This gives you a great deal, and it's a price I can realistically accept."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $13,500:** This is a slight compromise from my previous offer of $14,000 but still significantly higher than Bob's offer of $13,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while remaining firm on my desired value. 
* **Friendly message:** I reiterate my appreciation for Bob's offer while explaining my counter-offer in a positive and encouraging way. This aims to keep the negotiation amicable and encourage a final agreement."
