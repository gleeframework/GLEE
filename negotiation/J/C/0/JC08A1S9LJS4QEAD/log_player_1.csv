Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  I'm looking for a price around $19,000.  It's a great deal for something of this value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start negotiations high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning that you're looking for a price ""around"" $19,000 makes it seem like the price is somewhat flexible and open for discussion. 
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's value aims to justify the high price, even though Bob values it less.

**The goal is to find a price Bob is willing to pay that's significantly higher than your minimum ($15,000) while still being attractive enough for him to accept.**"
