""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential return on investment for you.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can certainly discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The offer of $1,350,000 is significantly above Bob's perceived value of $800,000. However, it's still a considerable discount from John's guaranteed purchase price of $1,500,000. This positioning might:
    * Intrigue Bob:  Even if Bob finds the initial price high, the fact that it's significantly discounted from a potential future sale might pique his interest.
    * Leave Room for Negotiation:  You have a buffer to potentially lower the price during the negotiation phase.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate and potentially lower your asking price based on Bob's responses and your assessment of the situation.  Remember, your fallback option is to sell to John for $1,500,000."
