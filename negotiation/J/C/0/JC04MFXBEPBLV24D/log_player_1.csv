"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation. It also leaves a substantial profit margin for Bob. This should encourage him to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to you. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price.  You have 8 rounds left and can still make a profit by going with John if no deal is reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer slightly from the previous round to show flexibility and encourage Bob to counteroffer. However,  $1,100,000 is still a good profit for me, and it's likely a price Bob will find appealing given the value he sees in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still too low.  I have 6 rounds remaining and I'm confident I can secure a better price by continuing to negotiate. It's also important to note that John's offer of $1,000,000 is still on the table, so I'm not losing out by rejecting Bob's offer at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm again lowering my offer, but this time only slightly.  This demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's profitable for me. By showing a willingness to budge while maintaining a relatively high price, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. With 4 rounds remaining, I can still potentially secure a better deal with Bob, and even if I don't, selling to John is a safe option.  It's important to note that John's offer is a guaranteed $1,000,000, while Bob's offer has the potential to be rejected in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1020000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making another slight reduction to my offer, but it's important to keep in mind that this is a very high price for Bob.  I'm hoping that with only three rounds remaining, Bob will realize the value of the product and make a counteroffer close to my offer.  If he doesn't, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds remaining, Bob's offer is still below the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  At this point, there's a high risk that we won't be able to reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob.  Therefore, it's more prudent to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John rather than risk a potential loss in the final round."
