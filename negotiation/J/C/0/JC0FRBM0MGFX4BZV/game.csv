"Thanks for the offer, Alice! However, that price is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I think that's a fair price for the product's value.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about $11,000? That's a reasonable compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm willing to consider $11,000, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my original offer. How about we meet at $12,200? It's still a good compromise, and I think the product's value is worth it.",12200.0,Alice,5,
