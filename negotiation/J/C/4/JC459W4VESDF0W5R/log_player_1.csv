Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $10,000 to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  By offering slightly above the product's value to Bob, I'm aiming to start the negotiation on a positive note and potentially achieve a higher final price. It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I will try to counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not quite there. I'm not willing to risk further negotiations with Bob, as his counteroffers seem to be stalling. It's better to secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob."
