"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high price, $100, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I have room to negotiate down. I also want to get the conversation going with a friendly message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $75. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is above my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $75 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85? That gives us both some room to work with."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice! However, $85 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $78. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $78 is just slightly below my minimum of $80, but I'm getting close to a deal.  Considering the risk of further negotiations and the potential for Bob to walk away, I'm going to accept his offer. It's better to secure a sale at a slightly lower price than to risk losing the deal altogether."
