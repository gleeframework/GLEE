"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I think $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",18000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I can't go as low as $18,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $20,000?",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $20,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $19,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",19000.0,Bob,4,
