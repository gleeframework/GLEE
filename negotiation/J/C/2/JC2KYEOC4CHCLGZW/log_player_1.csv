Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be happy to part with it for $19,000."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, I can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and increases the potential profit. 
* **Testing the waters:** A high initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest and gives me an idea of how much he values the product.
* **Confidence:** Offering a high price projects confidence in the product's value. 

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. I am prepared to negotiate with Bob and potentially lower the price to reach a mutually agreeable deal, keeping in mind my minimum of $12,000."
