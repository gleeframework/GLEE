"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's still well below my minimum price and a significant savings for you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is below her stated value, you know you can get the product for $8,000 from John.  Rejecting her offer opens the door for a better deal."
