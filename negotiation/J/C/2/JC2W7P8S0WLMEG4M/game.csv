"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand it's a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $82. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $75. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get the product without overspending.",75.0,Bob,4,
