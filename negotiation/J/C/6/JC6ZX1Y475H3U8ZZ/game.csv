"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  I know you value the product at $1,500,000, but I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  What about $1,050,000?  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This would give us both a good deal. Let's work together to find a solution that works for everyone.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
