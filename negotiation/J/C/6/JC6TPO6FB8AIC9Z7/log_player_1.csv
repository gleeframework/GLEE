Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $9,000. How about we try $7,500? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. Selling to John for $8,000 guarantees the minimum acceptable profit."
