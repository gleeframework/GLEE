Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a fantastic opportunity for you, and its value to you is easily worth seven figures. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,500,000.  This is a limited-time offer as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""seven figures"" and ""fantastic opportunity"" you frame the product's value in Bob's mind without revealing your own minimum.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Implying you have other buyers creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, by starting high you maximize your potential profit. You can always negotiate down if Bob counters, knowing you have John as a backup."
