"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that holds immense value, and I believe it could be a game-changer for your business. I understand you may not be familiar with its full potential, but I'm confident that after exploring its capabilities, you'll see its true worth. While I value this product at no less than $800000, I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects its potential.  I'm proposing a price of $1000000. Let's schedule a call to discuss this further and explore how this product can benefit you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $1,000,000, which is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  This means you can save $200,000 by accepting Alice's offer rather than buying from John."
