"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for you and allows me to recoup a significant portion of its value to me.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming down on your offer, but unfortunately, $1,100,000 is still below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  This would be a good compromise, allowing us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. ",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in negotiating. While your offer is getting closer, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,140,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.  Let's close this deal and move on.",1140000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,135,000 is just a little too low for me to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,140,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal. Let's come to an agreement.",1140000.0,Alice,7,
