"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000.

"I appreciate your concession, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget, and that's the highest I can go.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm still looking to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10000, and I'm willing to make a compromise to get the deal done.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $9000, but that's the maximum I can afford. I really think this product would be a great fit for me, so I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still a bit short on budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $10500. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise to get the deal done. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you can meet me halfway.",10750.0,Alice,5,
