"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but $850,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value. While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go that low. I'm offering $825,000, which is a fair price considering the benefits you'll reap. This is my final offer.  Let's close this deal and get this product in your hands.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $775,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're both committed to this deal, but $775,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $800,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows for a successful partnership.  If you're serious about this, let's finalize this deal.  ",800000.0,Alice,5,
