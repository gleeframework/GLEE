"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is significantly lower than the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, considering your willingness to negotiate. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,000,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply not enough for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's close this deal!",850000.0,Alice,5,
