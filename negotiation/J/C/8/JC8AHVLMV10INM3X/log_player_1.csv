Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000 but lower than the value of the product to Bob ($10,000).  This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize your profit:**  $9,500 is closer to Bob's valuation, potentially leading to a sale at a higher price. 
* **Minimize risk:**  If Bob rejects, you still have John as a backup buyer, guaranteeing you $8,000."
