"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high. It's above your maximum budget, and you can get the product from John for $1,000,000.  Rejecting allows you to start negotiating and hopefully get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is substantial.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,300,000 is still above your budget.  You can get the product from John for $1,000,000, making rejecting and counteroffering the best option to try and get closer to your target price."
