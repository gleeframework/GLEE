"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $9,000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it provides, and it's within your budget.  Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,
