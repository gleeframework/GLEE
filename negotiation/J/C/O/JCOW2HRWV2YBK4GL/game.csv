"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in your product. While I appreciate the potential value it may hold, my budget allows me to spend no more than $800000 on this purchase. Would it be possible to negotiate a price closer to this amount?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $800000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet halfway at $1150000. This price still allows for a reasonable profit for me and ensures a good deal for you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. Given my budgetary constraints, I would like to propose a price of $975000. This amount still leaves room for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my financial limits.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating. While $975000 is closer to my target, it's still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $1050000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and also allows for a reasonable profit for me. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
