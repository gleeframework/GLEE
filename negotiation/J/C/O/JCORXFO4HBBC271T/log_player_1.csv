"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept, but it's a good sign that he's willing to negotiate. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,600,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price that's closer to my goal. I believe this counteroffer is more attractive to Bob while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm running out of time, I'm still not willing to sell for $1,300,000. I believe I can get a higher price, even if it means continuing the negotiation with Bob. It's worth the risk to see if I can push him a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good deal. I'm willing to walk away if he rejects this offer and sell to John instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit with Bob. He's refusing to meet my minimum price, and with only 4 rounds left, I don't have time to continue negotiating. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
