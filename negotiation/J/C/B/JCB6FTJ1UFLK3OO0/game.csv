"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the market demand. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the movement, Alice, but the gap is still too wide for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I understand the value of the product, I can't justify going above $800,000. That's my final offer.  Let me know if that works for you.",800000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $800,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to accept. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",825000.0,Alice,7,
