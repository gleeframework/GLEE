This is a good point to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **You're saving a significant amount:**  Buying at $825,000 is a $375,000 savings compared to John's offer.
* **Alice is firming up:**  Her language suggests she's nearing her limit and might walk away soon. 
* **Further negotiation is risky:** Trying to get below $825,000 could backfire, leading you to John's less appealing offer."
