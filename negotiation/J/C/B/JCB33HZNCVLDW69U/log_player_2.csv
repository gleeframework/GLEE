{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's not worth paying Alice's asking price.  Let's see if we can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering Alice my maximum price. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product is worth $15,000 to her and $12,000 to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer, it's still too high. I'm willing to go slightly higher than my initial counteroffer, but $14,000 is still not acceptable. Let's see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Alice's last offer.  I'm hopeful that we can reach a deal at this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price. While I'd prefer to pay $13,000,  $13,500 is still a good deal considering I can get it for $12,000 from John. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiations."
