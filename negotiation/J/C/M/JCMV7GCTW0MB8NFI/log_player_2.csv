"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $11,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While I'm willing to pay up to $15,000, it's best to start with a significantly lower counteroffer. This gives room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $11,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's closer to Alice's value ($12,000) than my maximum, signaling I'm serious but looking for a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message is friendly and open to further discussion, indicating I'm willing to negotiate to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's make this happen!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice moved down from her initial offer, showing she's willing to negotiate.  This means there's likely still room for me to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Alternative Exists:** I have the option to buy from John for $15,000, so I'm not desperate to accept $13,000.
* **Seeking a Better Deal:** My goal is to save as much money as possible.  It's worth another counteroffer to see if I can get closer to $12,000 or even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  That seems fair to both of us."",
 ""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Alice moved down $1,000, so I'm reciprocating with a $1,000 counteroffer, meeting her in the middle. This shows a willingness to compromise while still working towards my goal.
* **Targeting Her Value:** $12,000 is Alice's estimated value for the product. While she may hope for more, this offer is likely her break-even point and might be too tempting to refuse. 
* **Clear and Concise:**  The message is straightforward, highlighting fairness and simplicity in the deal to encourage Alice to accept."
