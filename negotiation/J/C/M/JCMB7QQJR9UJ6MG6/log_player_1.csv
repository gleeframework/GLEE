Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you could offer it at $100 (its value to John), there's a chance Bob will accept a slightly lower price, netting you a profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $90 is a price point that's likely attractive to Bob (as it's more than his perceived value) while still providing you with a significant profit margin. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer at $100 gives you leverage in negotiations with Bob."
