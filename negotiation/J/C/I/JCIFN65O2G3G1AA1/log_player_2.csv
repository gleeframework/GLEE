"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is your maximum price, and it's the same price as John's offer. There's no immediate benefit to accepting. It's better to see if Alice is willing to negotiate down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $800,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that price."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Negotiation:**  We want to start the negotiation process by making a significant counteroffer. $700,000 is a substantial reduction from Alice's initial price, showing our seriousness about purchasing but also leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Keeping Options Open:** This offer allows us to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate while still having the option to buy from John if she rejects our counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress in Negotiation:** Alice has moved closer to our desired price by lowering her offer to $750,000.  
* **Fair Compromise:** $750,000 represents a good compromise, saving us $50,000 compared to our initial offer and John's price.
* **Time Efficiency:**  We've already established a willingness to negotiate, and further rounds might not result in a significantly lower price. Accepting this offer ensures we get the product at a reasonable price without risking losing it to John or engaging in further negotiation that may not be fruitful."
