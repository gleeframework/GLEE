Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to $150 as possible, as that's my guaranteed profit with John.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120. Offering it at or below this price guarantees a sale but minimizes profit.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering it at $140 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer while still exceeding his valuation. It also keeps the price attractive compared to my alternative buyer."
