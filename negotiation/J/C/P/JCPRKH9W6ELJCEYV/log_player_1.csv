{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** My message is friendly and encourages a response.
* **Value proposition:** I highlight the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategy:** 

By starting high, I can potentially secure a higher price.  If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to counter-offer and use John as a leverage point.  My goal is to reach a price as close to my minimum as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.
* **John provides leverage:**  I can use the fact that I have another buyer willing to pay $1,500,000 as a strong bargaining chip. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my minimum and potentially secure a better deal. If Bob continues to be stubborn, I can leverage John's offer and end the negotiation with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This takes into account your interest and allows for a reasonable profit margin.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I've lowered my price to $1,100,000, showing flexibility while still maintaining a significant profit.
* **Highlighting value and profit:** I remind Bob of the value of the product and the potential for him to make a profit.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  The message remains positive and encouraging to keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting his initial offer, I established my commitment to securing a higher price.
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer is a test to see if Bob is willing to compromise further.  If he rejects again, I'm prepared to either make another counteroffer or move on to John.
* **Negotiation is a game of give and take:**  By making concessions while still advocating for my desired price, I aim to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his offer of $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **Leverage with John:** I have a guaranteed sale for $1,500,000, so there's no reason to settle for a much lower price.

**Strategy:**

* **Continue negotiation:**  I will counter-offer with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to secure a better deal before resorting to selling to John.
* **Maintain pressure:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm serious about my desired price and am not afraid to walk away. 
* **Goal is to maximize profit:** My goal is to reach a price as close to $1,500,000 as possible, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to achieve that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, at $1,025,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in making a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards middle ground:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's offer of $950,000. This shows willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Reiterating value and fairness:** I remind Bob of the value of the product and emphasize that this price is fair for both parties.
* **Clear call to action:** I explicitly ask Bob to respond to my counteroffer, putting the ball in his court.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm still holding onto the knowledge that I can sell the product to John for a much higher price, providing me with a strong bargaining position.
* **Final push for a deal:** This is likely my last counteroffer before I might decide to accept John's offer. 
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  My goal is to reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial, even if it means accepting a price slightly below my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a fair deal, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $980000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation stalemate:**  Bob's final offer of $980,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum desired price. It's clear that further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to result in a price I'm comfortable with.
* **John's offer is significantly higher:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is a much better deal than accepting Bob's offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize profit:** My goal is to earn as much money as possible for the product, and John's offer provides the highest return.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a lengthy process with uncertain outcomes. Selling to John provides a quick and guaranteed sale at a profitable price.

**Conclusion:**

While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to settle for a price that is significantly below my desired minimum. John's offer provides a much better outcome, so I'm choosing to sell the product to him."
