"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. He's offering a price that's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice ($1,000,000), but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows that Bob is serious about buying the product, but is also looking for a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at $1,080,000, which is still within Bob's budget of $1,200,000. It's also better than John's offer, and a good compromise from Alice's previous counteroffer.  It's unlikely Bob will be able to get a significantly lower price, making this a good deal."
