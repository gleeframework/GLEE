Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Offers a good deal to Bob:**  The price is still lower than the value he places on the product. 
* **Maximizes your profit:** It's higher than the price John is willing to pay, ensuring you earn more.

However, there are other factors to consider:

* **Bob's negotiation skills:** If you think Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start with a slightly lower price.
* **Your willingness to walk away:** If you're really confident in getting a better deal from another buyer, you could even offer a higher price closer to $12,000."
