"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low yet. I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is still a great deal for you considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm trying to be fair to both of us, considering the product's value to me.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $85 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $90. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to go up to $87.50. Can you consider that?",87.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're just going in circles.  I understand you want a good deal, but $87.50 is simply too low for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $90. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to look at other options.",90.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're not willing to budge on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $87.50 and $90, which would be $88.75. Can you consider that?",88.75,Bob,8,
