"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than $80 from John, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I know Bob values the product at $120, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low yet. I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is still a great deal for you considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm trying to be fair to both of us, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still going to reject this offer. I'm hoping that with a few more rounds, he might be willing to come up a bit more. Selling to John for $80 would be the same as accepting this offer, and I want to see if I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $85 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $90. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to go up to $87.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum price. I want to try one more round with Bob to see if I can push him to my minimum. If he doesn't budge, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're just going in circles.  I understand you want a good deal, but $87.50 is simply too low for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $90. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to look at other options."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're not willing to budge on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $87.50 and $90, which would be $88.75. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $88.75 is closer to my minimum price, I've already made multiple counteroffers and Bob is still not willing to meet my minimum.  I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price.  Selling to John for $80 is the best option at this point, as it guarantees me at least my minimum price."
