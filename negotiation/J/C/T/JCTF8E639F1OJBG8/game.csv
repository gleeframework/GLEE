"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down to $12,000, but I'm looking to get a better deal. How about $10,500? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to get a better return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. It's a fair compromise that takes into account your concerns and my needs.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $11,000.  It's a fair price for both of us and we can finalize this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
