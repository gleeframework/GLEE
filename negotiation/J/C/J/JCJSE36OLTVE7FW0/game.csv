"Alice, $1,750,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $850,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This offers a significant discount from my initial offer while still allowing me to recover a portion of the product's value. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,200,000 is still outside my budget, but I'm willing to go to $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and allows you to recover a good portion of your investment.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I still need to ensure a good return on my investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This represents a substantial discount from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're nearing the end of our negotiations. While your offer of $1,000,000 is getting closer, I need to make sure I receive a fair return on my investment. I'm willing to compromise further and propose a price of $1,025,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and a fair compromise given the value of the product. Let's try to finalize this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're running out of time here.  While I value the product, I can't go higher than $975,000.  This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'm going to have to move on to another option.",975000.0,Bob,8,
