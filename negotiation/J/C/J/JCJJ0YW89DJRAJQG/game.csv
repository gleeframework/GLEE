"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's find a middle ground.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $11,250. Can you consider this counteroffer?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $11,250 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $11,750. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal.",11750.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $11,375. Can you consider this counteroffer?",11375.0,Bob,6,
