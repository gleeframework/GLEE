"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable product at a price significantly lower than its worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000 to make this deal work.  This price still allows for a significant profit for you, and it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. That's the highest I can go, but I really think it's a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
