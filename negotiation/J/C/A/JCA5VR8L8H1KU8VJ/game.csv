"Thank you for the opportunity, Alice. I understand the value you place on this product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1500000 asking price. I am willing to offer $1300000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $1300000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable accepting at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $1400000, acknowledging the value you see in the product. Let's find a common ground.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
