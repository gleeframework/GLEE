Alice has come down a bit, but I'm still hoping to get a better price. Let's see if we can squeeze out a little more."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $1,365,000, which is a decent price. While I'd prefer to get it even lower, I've already rejected a few offers. It's getting closer to my limit and I don't want to risk her getting frustrated and going back to her original price.  It's worth accepting this offer and securing the product."
