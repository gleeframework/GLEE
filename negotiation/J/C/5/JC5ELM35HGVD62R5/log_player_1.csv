Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it gives me some room to negotiate while still being significantly higher than my minimum value of $150. I'm curious to see if Bob is willing to pay this price or if he'll make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to sell it for that low, so I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $175.  This is still above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to come up a bit higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer more, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with nothing.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product to Bob."
