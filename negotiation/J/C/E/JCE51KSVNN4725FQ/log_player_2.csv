# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great investment for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer. You can do better than $1,200,000 since you are willing to pay up to $1,500,000.  By rejecting, you open the door for counteroffers and a chance to save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000.

You should accept Alice's offer.  You are able to get the product for $1,075,000, which is lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  While you might be able to get a slightly lower price by continuing to negotiate, there is no guarantee that Alice will budge further, and you risk losing the deal altogether.  It's better to secure a good deal than to risk getting nothing."
