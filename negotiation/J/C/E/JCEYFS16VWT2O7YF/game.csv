,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $20000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $15000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm keen to make a deal, $15000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $17500?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product.  Let me know if that works for you.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While I'm still interested, $17500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable going. How about we meet in the middle at $16250? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. Let me know what you think.",16250.0,Bob,4,
