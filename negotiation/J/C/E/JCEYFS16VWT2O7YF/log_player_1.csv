{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this unique product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm asking for $20,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm emphasizing the potential value to Bob to pique his interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage.

This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a higher price than my minimum, while still leaving room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $20000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $15000 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe there's potential to get closer to my initial asking price of $20,000. I'm going to counteroffer to see if I can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'm keen to make a deal, $15,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $17,500?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm proposing a middle ground that's closer to my initial asking price, but still a significant increase from Bob's offer.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I'm framing the price as a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.
* **Focus on a Deal:** I'm emphasizing my desire to reach an agreement, but not giving up on my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While I'm still interested, $17500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable going. How about we meet in the middle at $16250? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $16,250 is a significant increase from his initial offer of $15,000, and it's getting closer to my desired price point.  While it's still below my ideal price, it's a good compromise, and the risk of further negotiation with Bob or selling to John for $15,000 is not worth it.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a price that's reasonably close to my target."
