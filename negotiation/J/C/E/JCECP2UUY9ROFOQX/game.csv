"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $100 is the lowest I can go. If you're still interested, let me know.",100.0,Alice,3,

"I understand it's a good product Alice, but $100 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That's my final offer.",80.0,Bob,4,
