Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary while still ensuring I make a good profit. I'm hoping Bob will be interested enough to engage in a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  While I need to be strategic, selling for $850,000 would leave me with a significant loss. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up with a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still more than what Bob offered, and it gives him a good opportunity to increase his bid while I still make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I could keep negotiating with him, there's no guarantee he'll come closer to my desired price. Selling to John ensures I get a guaranteed profit of $1,500,000, which is more than what Bob is currently offering."
