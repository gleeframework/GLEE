"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,250,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,250,000, so how about we try $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, and we're getting closer! However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too far below what I need to make this work. Let's try a compromise - $1,200,000. This would give you a great deal, and it's a price I can accept.  Let's seal the deal!",1200000.0,Alice,5,
