"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $800000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more progress. I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1050000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll need to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
