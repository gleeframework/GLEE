"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value it will bring to your business.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to settle for $760,000? I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the product's value while working within my constraints.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $760,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm now offering the product to you for $810,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise considering the product's value.",810000.0,Alice,5,
