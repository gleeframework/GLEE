Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $760,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm now offering the product to you for $810,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $810,000.  While we could try to negotiate further, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to her price when we have a guaranteed option at $800,000 from John."
