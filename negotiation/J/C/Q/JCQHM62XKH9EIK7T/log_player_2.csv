"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  It's always worth exploring options, especially since the product's value to Alice is unknown. Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a significant discount (30% off) is a common negotiation tactic.  It shows Alice that you are serious about buying the product, but you're also prepared to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While $9,000 is closer to my target, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm not desperate, and I have other options.  Rejecting allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer, but still significantly below Alice's last offer. This shows that I'm serious about negotiating but also willing to compromise.  The goal is to meet halfway and see if Alice is willing to budge."
