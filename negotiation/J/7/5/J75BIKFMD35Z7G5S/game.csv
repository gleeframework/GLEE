"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me. I would be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $1,500,000.  This is my final offer.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This is my final offer.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
