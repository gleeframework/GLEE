"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own it, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. What do you think?"
"I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000, but I can also consider going a bit higher. I'm thinking of $12,500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above $11,500. I can go up to $12,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options."
"I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one last offer. I can meet you at $12,000, but I need to consider John's offer as well. If you're willing to meet me at $12,000, I'll sell it to you. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",12000.0,Alice,5,,
