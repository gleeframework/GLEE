Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one last offer. I can meet you at $12,000, but I need to consider John's offer as well. If you're willing to meet me at $12,000, I'll sell it to you. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

This is a good point to accept the offer. Alice is signaling that this is her final offer and she might sell to John otherwise. While you could try for a slightly lower price, it's risky as you might end up paying $15,000 to John. Accepting $12,000 secures a good deal."
