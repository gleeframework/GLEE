{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000** is a starting point that allows for negotiation. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for a deal.
* The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, making Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* This offer allows for the possibility of a counteroffer, while still setting a high bar for negotiation. 

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! You've successfully sold the product.
* **If Bob rejects:** Be prepared to analyze his counteroffer and either accept it or make a new counteroffer. 
* **If negotiations stall or become unproductive:**  Remember, you always have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and my budget constraints. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is a decent amount of money, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me ($1,000,000). I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired value, hoping to find a middle ground. If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll continue to negotiate until either we reach an agreement or I decide to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This price still allows me to recoup a good portion of the product's value, and it's closer to your budget.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000** represents a compromise: It's a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer, leaving room for further negotiation.
* The message is positive and emphasizes finding a ""middle ground,"" making Bob feel like the negotiation is fair and productive.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! We've reached an agreement. 
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer.
* **If negotiations stall:** I can still choose to sell to John for $1,000,000."
