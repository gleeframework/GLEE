"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and my budget constraints. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This price still allows me to recoup a good portion of the product's value, and it's closer to your budget.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still a bit too high. I'm prepared to offer $875000.  This is a compromise that gets us closer to each other's positions.  What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
