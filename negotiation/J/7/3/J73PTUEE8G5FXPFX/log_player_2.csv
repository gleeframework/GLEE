"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for significantly less from John ($8,000).  Even though Alice believes the product is worth more to you, your maximum budget is your priority. Buying from John saves you the most money."
