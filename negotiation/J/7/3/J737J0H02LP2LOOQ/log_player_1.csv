Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm offering the product for $100, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I emphasize the product's worth to Bob, making the price seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By offering a price that's not my absolute maximum, I show flexibility and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! $100 is a good price, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $90? It's still a great deal for you, and it would be a good deal for me as well. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my desired price:**  $90 is only $10 lower than my initial offer and above my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price or a prolonged process, potentially resulting in a sale to John at the lower price.
* **Time is a factor:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and avoids the risk of a longer negotiation leading to a lower price or a sale to John."
