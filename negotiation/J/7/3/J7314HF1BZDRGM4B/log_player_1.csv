Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects the product's value. How about we meet halfway at $1,100,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering my budget and the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach $1,000,000.  I have a guaranteed offer from John for my desired amount. It's time to cut off negotiations with Bob and solidify the sale to John."
