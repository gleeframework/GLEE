"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $110. This means you can potentially save some money by negotiating further.
* **You have room to bargain:** You are willing to pay up to $120, so you can afford to counteroffer with a lower price.  
* **Buying from John is a fallback option:** If you can't reach an agreement with Alice, you can still get the product from John, but it will cost you more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her perceived value of $80. This shows I'm serious about buying but also want to get a good deal. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This leaves room for Alice to counter-offer if she wants to, while still allowing me to potentially get the product for less than John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now closer to my desired price:**  She has lowered her price to $105, which is within my acceptable range. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject my next counteroffer, and I might end up having to pay John's price of $120.
* **Time and Effort:** Accepting Alice's offer saves time and effort compared to continuing the negotiation."
