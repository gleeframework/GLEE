``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum desired price but not so high as to immediately scare Bob away. It leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $18000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $18,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500

While $17,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hopeful that I can get a bit more. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if I can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $18,250. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 18250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $17000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $17,000 is only $2,000 above my minimum. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will continue to lower his offer, and I might end up with a price I'm not satisfied with.  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum, and I'll avoid further negotiation with Bob."
