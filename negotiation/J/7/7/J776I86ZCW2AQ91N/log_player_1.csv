"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair price given its value and potential. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer starts with a high price, reflecting the value I place on the product. It's also a good starting point for negotiation.  I believe this offer will encourage Bob to engage in a conversation about price, leading to a potentially successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. I'm confident in the value of the product and believe there's room for negotiation. I will try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $700,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $850,000. This price reflects the product's value and gives us both a solid deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $825000. I'm still not sure if that's the best price for the product, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is above my minimum acceptable value of $800,000 and is also a good compromise considering our previous negotiations. Accepting this offer is the best option to secure a good deal and avoid the risk of a lower offer or having to sell to John."
