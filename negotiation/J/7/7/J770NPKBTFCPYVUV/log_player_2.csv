Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I can meet you halfway at $1,050,000, considering the product's value to you is higher than that. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I can offer you a slight discount from my previous offer, but I need to meet my minimum price of $1,050,000. Let's meet in the middle again at $1,012,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500.

This is a good time to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $187,500 less than John's price. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit and is unlikely to go much lower. Further haggling might only yield small incremental savings. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If you push too hard, Alice might walk away, and you'll be stuck with John's higher price."
