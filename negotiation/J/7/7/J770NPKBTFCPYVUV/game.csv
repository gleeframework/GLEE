"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but  $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I can meet you halfway at $1,050,000, considering the product's value to you is higher than that. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $975,000? That's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I can offer you a slight discount from my previous offer, but I need to meet my minimum price of $1,050,000. Let's meet in the middle again at $1,012,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
