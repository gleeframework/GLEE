"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly valuable. Considering its worth to me and its quality, I propose a price of $100. I believe this is a fair offer that respects both the value of the product and your budget.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $85 for it, considering it's worth $80 to me.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering your valuation of the product and my desire to make a sale, I am willing to accept an offer of $90 for the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $87, which is right in the middle of our two valuations. What do you say?",87.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see your point, Bob. To reach a compromise, I'm willing to accept an offer of $88 for the product. This is a reasonable midpoint between our valuations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",88.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $88 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $87.  Let's close this deal.",87.0,Bob,6,
