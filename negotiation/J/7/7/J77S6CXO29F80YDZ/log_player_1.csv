Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $80, but still lower than Bob's perceived value of $150. This gives Bob room to negotiate, while still allowing me to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price by sending him a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm countering with $115. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial counteroffer. It's a good middle ground that might be appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to sell for closer to $120, Bob's offer of $105 is a good compromise.  It's significantly higher than selling to John, and further negotiation might not yield much more. I'm going to accept his offer and finalize the sale."
