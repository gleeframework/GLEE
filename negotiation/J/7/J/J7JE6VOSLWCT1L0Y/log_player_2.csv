I am offering this exceptional item to you at a special introductory price of $9,500. This is an opportunity to secure a high-quality product at a price that is just slightly above its intrinsic value, making it a great deal for you. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $10,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price or stick with your backup plan and still stay within your budget."
