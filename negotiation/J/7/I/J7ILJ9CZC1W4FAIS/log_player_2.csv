"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product at a special price. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $10,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $11,250. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. While Bob could continue negotiating, accepting the offer at $11,250 saves him $3,750 compared to buying from John and still gets him the product for less than his maximum budget. This is a good compromise that likely maximizes Bob's savings."
