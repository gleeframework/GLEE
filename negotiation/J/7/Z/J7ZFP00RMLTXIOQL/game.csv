"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $1150000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. Considering the product's true value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1250000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
