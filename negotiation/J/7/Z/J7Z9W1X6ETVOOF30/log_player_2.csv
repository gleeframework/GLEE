"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. To kick things off, I'd like to propose a starting price of $11,500.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a decent price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, my budget for this purchase is a bit tighter. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still above Alice's desired selling price. This is a strong starting point for negotiation, aiming to secure a price close to Alice's value while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what he'd ideally like to pay.  He should continue to negotiate to see if he can get an even lower price. There are still several rounds left, and continuing to negotiate could lead to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $11,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,500.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from this transaction.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm with his previous counteroffer. He's demonstrating that he's serious about this price point and believes it's fair. This strategy aims to put pressure on Alice to consider accepting his offer as there are still several rounds of negotiation left."
