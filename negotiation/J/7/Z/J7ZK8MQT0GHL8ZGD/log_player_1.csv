``` 

This initial offer sets a high price, but it is below the minimum I'm willing to accept. This will allow room for negotiation if Bob counters.  I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency and value with my message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is outside of my budget.  I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,500,000. While I'm interested in selling to Bob, I'm not willing to accept such a low price at this point. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1750000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1350000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement.

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a compromise closer to my desired value."

Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1600000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1450000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. Let's try to close this deal and make it work for both of us.
