Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a price that's beneficial for you.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly remind Bob of its worth without being too pushy.
* **Alternative:**  By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you subtly imply that Bob might lose out on a good deal if he doesn't take the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is conversational, indicating you're open to discussing the price further if Bob objects.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
