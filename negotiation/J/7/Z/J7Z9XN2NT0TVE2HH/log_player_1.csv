Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a special price of $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's value instead of just focusing on the price can make the offer more appealing.

While there's a chance Bob might reject this initial offer, it gives us room to potentially negotiate down to a price still higher than $80. If he rejects it outright, we don't lose anything because we have John as a guaranteed buyer at our minimum price."
