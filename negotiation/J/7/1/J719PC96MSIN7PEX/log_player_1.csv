"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting high, at $17,000, knowing Bob values the product at $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum of $15,000.  I'm also aware of John's offer of $15,000, which gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $14,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum desired price of $15,000. I believe I can push for a better deal. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my goal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $16,000. This is still a good distance from Bob's offer of $14,000, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I believe a price between $15,000 and $16,000 is fair, given that Bob values the product at $12,000 and I value it at least $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle for less than $15,000. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating.  The pressure is building, but I still have a few rounds to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
```

I'm making a final push for a price close to my minimum.  $15,500 is a compromise, reflecting Bob's increasing willingness to pay and my own need to get as close to my desired price as possible.  It's a good balance, and I'm hopeful Bob will accept.  If not, I'm still confident I can close a deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is too far below my minimum. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to accept a price that low. It's time to move on.  I'll sell the product to John for $15,000.  This is a guaranteed deal that meets my minimum price."
