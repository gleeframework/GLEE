"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I'm willing to negotiate to see if I can get a price closer to my $10,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal. 
* **Target Price in Mind:** My ideal price is around $10,000, but I'm leaving some wiggle room in case Alice is open to a quick agreement. 
* **Polite and Direct:**  I want to maintain a positive tone while being clear about my budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm confident you'll find this a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to my range, but $10,500 is still above my target. I'm willing to see if I can get her a bit lower, but I need to be prepared to walk away and buy from John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me. Would you consider $9,750? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm meeting Alice halfway between our last two offers, showing a willingness to compromise but also standing firm on my budget.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating I'm ""ready to close,"" I'm indicating this is a serious offer and encouraging a quick decision.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind. If Alice doesn't budge significantly in the next round or two, I'll likely go with John's $10,000 price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $10,250 is only slightly above my ideal price, and it's a reasonable compromise. 
* **Time Investment:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield much more savings and could drag out the process. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a chance Alice might not go any lower, and I'd end up with John's offer anyway. It's better to secure a slightly higher price now than risk losing out."
