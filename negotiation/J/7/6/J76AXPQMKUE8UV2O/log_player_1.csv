Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value of $15,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $14,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a backup buyer at $12,000, ensuring you don't lose money."
