"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Can you consider that?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? I'm open to a quick deal.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $85. Can you consider that?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $85 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $90. That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly.",90.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to run out of time here.  $87.50 is still a bit low, but to finalize this deal, I'm willing to go down to $89. Let's get this done.",89.0,Alice,7,
