"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $15,000?  That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're still hesitant, but  $13,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  Would you be willing to go up to $14,000?  It's only a $1,000 difference, and it would be a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but  $13,500 still isn't quite enough.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $14,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",14000.0,Alice,7,
