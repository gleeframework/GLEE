,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $80 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, however, $200 was already a discounted price and going down to $80 would mean selling it at a significant loss.  Could you meet me halfway at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $100, which is a fair price considering my budget and your asking price.  Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,4,
