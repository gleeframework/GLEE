"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than her initial value of $12,000, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice."
