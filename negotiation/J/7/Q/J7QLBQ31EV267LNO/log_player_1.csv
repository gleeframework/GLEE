"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy with $15,000, I'm not going to rush into accepting Bob's offer just yet.  He's offering my minimum, so I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but I also believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer to $15,500, which is above my minimum and closer to my desired price. I'm willing to accept this offer to secure a deal and avoid the risk of further negotiations.  It's a good compromise, and I'm happy with the outcome."
