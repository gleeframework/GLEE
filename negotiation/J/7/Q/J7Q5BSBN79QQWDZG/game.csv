"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd need to see it at a lower price point. How about $9000? ",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $10500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9500.  Let's see if we can find a compromise there.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9500. I'm willing to come down to $10000, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me there?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. $10000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $9750.  Let's see if we can agree on that.  It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9750, but I'd like to throw in an additional incentive to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free maintenance package worth $500. That brings the total value to $10250. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Alice,7,
