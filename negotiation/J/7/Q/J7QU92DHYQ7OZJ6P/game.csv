"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what I could get elsewhere. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, but that's my final offer. It's still a good deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for less than its worth to you. If you're not interested at that price, I'll be moving on to another buyer.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I can't meet you at $1,000,000.  How about we settle in the middle at $800,000? That's a fair compromise.",800000.0,Bob,4,
