"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200, given its value. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  Could you do $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $140 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $75? That's a fair offer.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $75.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $110 is closer, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could you do $80? That's the absolute highest I can go.",80.0,Bob,6,
