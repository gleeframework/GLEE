Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $140 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $75? That's a fair offer.

You have three options:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $110 is closer, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could you do $80? That's the absolute highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. Cutting my losses now and selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price."
