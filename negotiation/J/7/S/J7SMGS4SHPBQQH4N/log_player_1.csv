Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $18,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $12,000, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's not outrageous:** It's not so high that Bob will immediately dismiss it, giving you a chance to see if he's interested.

The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $15,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the possibility of getting a higher price open.  

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob.  Consider offering a price slightly lower than your initial offer but still higher than $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $16,500?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it's something we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $15500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $15,500 is close to your ideal price and significantly better than selling to John for $12,000. It's likely that you won't be able to negotiate a higher price, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting the offer ensures a profitable sale and avoids potential further haggling."
