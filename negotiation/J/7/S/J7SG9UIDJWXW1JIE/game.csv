"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $750,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to offer the product for $850,000. This represents a significant discount from my original asking price, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $775,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the original price was $1,000,000 and you've already discounted it significantly.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but unfortunately, $775,000 is still below what I can accept for this product.  I've already come down significantly from my initial price, and I'm confident that its value justifies a higher offer. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to offer one final compromise: $825,000. This is a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. This will be my final offer.  Let me know your decision.",825000.0,Alice,5,
