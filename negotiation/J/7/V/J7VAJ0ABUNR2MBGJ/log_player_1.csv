Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product, which I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique benefits, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant return you'll see from it."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting with a significantly higher offer ($1,900,000) leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""exceptional"" and ""unique"" nature to justify the high asking price.
* **Backup Option:** We have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John, so there's an incentive to aim high with Bob.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of John's offer. In a real-world negotiation, information asymmetry plays a crucial role."
