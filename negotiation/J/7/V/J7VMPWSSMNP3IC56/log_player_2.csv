"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's a unique opportunity that I believe would be highly valuable to your business.  My initial offer is $1,400,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is within your budget, but you can likely get a better price.  Since you have 10 rounds and a backup option with John, it's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to invest a bit less at this time.  Would you be willing to consider $1,200,000?  I believe this price is still fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still above her minimum acceptable price. It shows that you're serious about buying the product, but also that you're willing to negotiate.  It also leaves room for further negotiation in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However,  $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm happy to compromise, but I can't go lower than $1,300,000.  This price still allows for a significant profit for you while respecting my own value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still within your budget, but there is still potential to negotiate further.  By rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer, you can potentially get a lower price.  It's better to continue exploring negotiation options with Alice rather than buying from John, as John's offer is significantly higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident that $1,250,000 would be a fair price for both of us.  It allows for a good profit for you while still being within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's halfway between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer, showing a willingness to meet in the middle.  It's still a good deal for you, saving you $150,000 compared to John's price.  By continuing to negotiate, you're increasing the chances of finding a price that works for both of you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within a reasonable range for you. You've already saved a significant amount of money compared to John's price, and further negotiation might not yield much more savings.  With only 5 rounds remaining, it's time to secure the deal and avoid the risk of Alice backing out or John's offer expiring.  Accepting this offer ensures you get the product for a good price while minimizing the risk."
