"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $12000 to us. Considering its quality and unique features, I believe it would be a valuable addition to your collection. Would you like to proceed with purchasing it at this special introductory price?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. After considering your offer, I am unable to accept $9000 for the product. Our valuation remains at $12000. However, I am open to discussing a compromise that might be acceptable to both parties. Would you be willing to increase your offer closer to our valuation?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, Bob. Considering our product's value and the market conditions, I am unable to accept $9500. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we aim for $10500? This would be a fair compromise between our valuations.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10500. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this price?",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we set the price at $10250? This is a bit higher than your last offer but still below our initial valuation. It represents a reasonable compromise.",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $10250. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, which is the price I was initially considering when I had the option to buy from John. Can you consider this price?",10000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. Let's try to bridge the gap. How about we settle on $10125 for the product? This is slightly above your previous offer but still below our initial valuation. It's a fair compromise considering our discussions so far.",10125.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
I'm not willing to go any higher than $10000. I've made a firm decision to buy the product from John for $10000 if we can't come to an agreement. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.,10000.0,Bob,10,
