"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I believe your initial asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,100,000.  I feel this is a fair offer that reflects its worth to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price point reflects a more accurate assessment of the product's potential. ",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price that reflects the product's value.  I'm still very interested, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Could we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
