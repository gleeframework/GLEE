Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price point reflects a more accurate assessment of the product's potential.
