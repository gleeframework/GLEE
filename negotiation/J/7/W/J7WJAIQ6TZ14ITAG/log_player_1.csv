Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I believe your initial asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,100,000.  I feel this is a fair offer that reflects its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price point reflects a more accurate assessment of the product's potential. "",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a price that reflects the product's value.  I'm still very interested, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Could we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? I believe that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob is clearly very interested and has moved closer to my acceptable range. Accepting $1,200,000 ensures a significant profit and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
