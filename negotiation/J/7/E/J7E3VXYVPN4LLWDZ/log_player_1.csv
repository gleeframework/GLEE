Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential $300,000 surplus to negotiate.
* **One Shot:** You only get one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you go with John.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to capture as much of that $300,000 surplus as possible, but not so high that Bob walks away. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the offer as an ""opportunity.""
* **High but Reasonable:** $1,450,000 leaves Bob with a $50,000 gain, which is still a significant incentive to accept.
* **Confident Justification:** By mentioning ""fair deal"" and ""significant returns,"" you subtly anchor the price in terms of Bob's potential profit. 

**Important Notes**

* This is just one possible offer. You can adjust the price slightly up or down depending on your risk tolerance.
* Bob's personality and negotiation style are unknown.  A more aggressive offer might be possible, but this approach aims for a balance between ambition and the risk of losing the deal."
