"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a unique and valuable item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and gives you a good return on your investment. Let's see if we can make this work.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price that balances our interests and reflects the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to go a little higher than my initial offer.  How about $1,100,000? This reflects the product's value to me and allows for a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to go a bit higher. However, I was thinking that we could meet somewhere in the middle of my previous offer and your new offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This way, we can both feel like we're getting a good deal. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
