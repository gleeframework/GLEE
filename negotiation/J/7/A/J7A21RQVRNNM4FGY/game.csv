"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $80 for it. Would that be possible?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but unfortunately, $80 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $90?  I'm willing to be flexible, but that's the lowest I can go.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I understand your position and I appreciate your flexibility. However, based on my budget constraints, I am unable to meet you at $90. Could we perhaps aim for $85 as a compromise?",85.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try $95. It's a good price for you, and I can live with it.  What do you say?",95.0,Alice,5,
