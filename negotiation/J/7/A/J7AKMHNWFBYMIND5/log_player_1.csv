Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $95, but I'm open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the product's value to Bob, hoping to increase his desire to buy.  If Bob rejects, I'm ready to counter, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is close to my minimum, I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, aiming for a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $85 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to go up to $90? It's a fair price for the value you'll get from this product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $90. Would you be willing to meet me at $87? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$87 is a good price, and it's likely that further negotiation will only lead to a lower offer.  It's better to accept now and ensure a sale that is closer to my desired price."
