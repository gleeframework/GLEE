Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000, and I'm still willing to sell it to you at a discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is aware of your valuation ($10,000) and is using it to her advantage.
* While $12,000 is lower than her initial offer, there's still room for negotiation. 
* We can try pushing Alice a bit further down before considering John's offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $9,500 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has indicated this is her final offer.
* Her final offer of $13,500 is significantly higher than John's offer of $10,000.
* It's unlikely Alice will budge further, and continuing to negotiate may not yield a better result than John's offer."
