"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. My initial offer is $1,200,000.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in this product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000.  I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. My revised offer is $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me at the moment. Would you consider $700,000? I'm eager to finalize this deal and believe this price is a reasonable compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to get closer to my target price. My revised offer is $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,5,
