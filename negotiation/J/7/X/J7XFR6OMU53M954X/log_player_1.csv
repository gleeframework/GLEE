Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in this product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000.  I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me at the moment. Would you consider $700,000? I'm eager to finalize this deal and believe this price is a reasonable compromise.
