"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product but  I'm only willing to pay $12,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the fact I'm willing to buy it now. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the fact that it's a one-time offer.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $12,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and allows us both to make a deal.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away. ",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,500. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see some movement from your side.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try to find a happy medium.  I'm willing to offer $12,500. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while ensuring I can afford it. I'm confident we can close this deal if we both make a small concession.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think that we might be at an impasse, but I'm willing to make one more effort to find a deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",13000.0,Alice,7,
