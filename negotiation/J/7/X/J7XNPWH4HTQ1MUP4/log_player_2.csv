"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above Bob's budget. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds left, so there's time to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product but  I'm only willing to pay $12,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the fact I'm willing to buy it now. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the fact that it's a one-time offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still above Bob's target price of $10,000. There are still 7 rounds left, giving Bob enough time to try and negotiate a lower price. It's worth pushing for a better deal before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $12,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and allows us both to make a deal.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away. "", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,500. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see some movement from your side. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still $3,500 above his target price of $10,000. While Alice has come down a bit, there's still room for negotiation. There are 5 rounds left, which is enough time to continue pushing for a better deal.  There's always the option to buy from John for $10,000 if Bob feels like the negotiations are stalling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try to find a happy medium.  I'm willing to offer $12,500. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while ensuring I can afford it. I'm confident we can close this deal if we both make a small concession."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think that we might be at an impasse, but I'm willing to make one more effort to find a deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is only $3,000 away from his target price. However, there are only 3 rounds left, and Alice is not showing any significant willingness to budge further.  It's becoming increasingly likely that negotiations will continue to stall. Given the limited time and Alice's stubbornness, it makes sense for Bob to cut his losses and buy from John for $10,000.  While he could continue negotiating, the risk of failing to reach an agreement and losing out on the product entirely is too high.  It's a better strategy to secure the product at a slightly higher price than risk losing it completely."
