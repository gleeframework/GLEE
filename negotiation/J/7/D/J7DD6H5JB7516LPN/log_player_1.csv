Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me a good margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$80 is way too low for me.  I'm not going to sell it for that. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm counteroffering at $120. This is still above my minimum price of $150 but shows I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this will be more appealing to Bob than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counteroffer again at $110.  I'm willing to go a little lower, but I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been negotiating with Bob for a while now and we seem to be stuck. While $100 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough for me to make a decent profit.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. It's a safe bet, and I can always try to get a better price with another buyer later."
