"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think a more reasonable price would be $12,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about the product, Bob, but $7,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $9,000. This is my final offer on this price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down, her ""final offer"" of $9,000 is still higher than John's offer of $8,000. It's time to cut negotiations short and secure the product at the best price."
