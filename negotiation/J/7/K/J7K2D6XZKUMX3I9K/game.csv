,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think a more reasonable price would be $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While $12,000 is closer, it's still a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $7,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about the product, Bob, but $7,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $9,000. This is my final offer on this price point.",9000.0,Alice,5,
