"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high quality and unique features, I believe it's worth more than $150 to you. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as low a price as possible, ideally under $80. Alice's initial offer of $120 is too high. It's worth exploring if a lower price is possible through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value, but $120 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it, given its potential benefits to me."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about if I offer the product to you for $95? This is a bit closer to your offer, but still reflects the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $80. While it's closer to his counteroffer, Bob can potentially secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate. There are still rounds left, and he can try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $85.  It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering our previous discussions, I believe we can reach a satisfactory agreement. How about $90 for the product? It's a step towards your offer, while still reflecting its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the product for the lowest possible price. While Alice's offer of $90 is getting closer to his budget, he's still willing to risk the negotiation continuing. He can potentially get a better deal, as he's already been able to push Alice down from $120 to $90.  There's still a chance to get closer to his desired price of $85."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $88 for the product.  It's a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
