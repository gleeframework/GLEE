"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately $12500 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13250? This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let me know your thoughts.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12800? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my means.",12800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12800 is still too far below my minimum. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. How about $13000? This price would allow me to make a reasonable profit, and it's still within your stated willingness to pay a premium.  I'm open to discussing further, but I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12800 and $13000. How about $12900? I'm willing to make a small concession to get to a mutually beneficial agreement.",12900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my desired price. However, I'm still not able to go lower than $13000. This price allows me to make a fair profit while still giving you a competitive deal.  If you're truly interested in this product, I believe this is the best price we can achieve. Please consider this final offer.",13000.0,Alice,7,
