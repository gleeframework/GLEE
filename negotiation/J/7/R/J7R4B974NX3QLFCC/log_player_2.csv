"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

You can get the product from John for $1,000,000, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at $1,100,000.  You should reject and see if you can get a better price from Alice."

# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is still a great price for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. What do you think?

Alice is willing to sell for $1,025,000, which is more than John's offer of $1,000,000.  It's time to go with the safer option and buy from John."
