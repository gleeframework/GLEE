"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,500,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, recognizing its value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting both its true worth and our desire to reach a deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,150,000 is pushing the limits of what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This recognizes the true value of this product while acknowledging your willingness to find a solution.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
