"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price and potentially save a considerable amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,500,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, recognizing its value.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting both its true worth and our desire to reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000, although it is closer.  I will continue negotiating in hopes of finding a more favorable price.  Since I can always buy from John for $1,200,000, I am not under pressure to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit beyond my reach. To make this deal work, I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000.  This reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's find a way to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,150,000 is pushing the limits of what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This recognizes the true value of this product while acknowledging your willingness to find a solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, but it's still $50,000 above my maximum budget. I can still get the product from John for $1,200,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept. I will try one more counteroffer before potentially buying from John."
