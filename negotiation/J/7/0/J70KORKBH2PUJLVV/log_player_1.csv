"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This allows room for negotiation and might lead to a higher final price.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's ""potential,""  I am subtly anchoring the value in Bob's mind, justifying the high asking price.
* **Open Communication:** I'm inviting Bob's feedback (""What are your thoughts?"") to establish a collaborative tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,500,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, recognizing its value.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his own stated value for the product.  While his message aims to be collaborative, accepting such a low offer at this stage would leave a lot of money on the table. It's worth continuing the negotiation to try and find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting both its true worth and our desire to reach a deal."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Slightly):** While I'm not accepting Bob's low offer, I'm showing flexibility by significantly decreasing my asking price.  
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to counter his lowball offer and justify my counteroffer.
* **Seeking Agreement:**  Phrases like ""fair compromise"" and ""our desire to reach a deal"" reinforce the collaborative spirit and a win-win outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit beyond my reach. To make this deal work, I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000.  This reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's find a way to bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but Bob's offer is still below my minimum and John's standing offer. I need to hold firm to push for a better price, but I also need to signal that I'm willing to negotiate to keep Bob engaged.  Selling to John is a last resort if Bob's offers don't improve significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,150,000 is pushing the limits of what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This recognizes the true value of this product while acknowledging your willingness to find a solution."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm holding firm above my $1,200,000 minimum but making a smaller concession this round to signal my seriousness about closing a deal.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic suggests fairness and compromise.
* **Value & Solution:** I'm continually tying the price back to the product's value while emphasizing finding a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,250,000 is a significant step closer.  To finalize the deal, I'm offering $1,225,000. This reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is above both my minimum price and John's standing offer. It's a strong deal, and further haggling might make Bob reconsider. Time to accept and close the deal!"
