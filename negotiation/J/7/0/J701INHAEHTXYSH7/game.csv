"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,400,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,350,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
