Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in the product,  $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it, as this is the maximum I can afford. I'm confident we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
