"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant benefits it offers.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in the product,  $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it, as this is the maximum I can afford. I'm confident we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is reasonable, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above what I can manage. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000 for the product. It's a fair price that balances your need for a good sale and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but I'm confident that this product's value for your business justifies a higher investment.  Let's meet in the middle - I propose $1,500,000. This keeps us moving forward and reflects my best effort to find a mutually agreeable price.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but $1,500,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,400,000. It's a fair price that recognizes the product's value while respecting my financial constraints. Let's try to reach an agreement on this price.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
