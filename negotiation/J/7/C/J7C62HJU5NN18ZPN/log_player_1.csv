Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob at my minimum price of $12,000.  Since John is willing to pay that amount, I'm not willing to lower my price at this stage. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can reach a compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $11,000.  This is a compromise between my minimum price and his offer.  It's still a good deal for me, but it gives Bob some room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is closer to my minimum price of $12,000, and it's higher than John's offer of $12,000.  I'm going to accept this offer and sell the product to Bob."
