"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you have a fallback option with John for $1,500,000. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price slightly to avoid losing the sale.  It's worth seeing if you can get a better deal."
