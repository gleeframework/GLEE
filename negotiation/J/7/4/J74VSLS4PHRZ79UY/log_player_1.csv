Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price significantly higher than your minimum value of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges Bob's potential interest and frames the price as fair.  This strategy aims to maximize your earnings while leaving space for Bob to counteroffer without immediately resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than John's offer, it's still far below your desired range.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your goal while showing him you're willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand $9,000 is a good price for you, I'm still looking for a bit more. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair compromise considering the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,750 is a good compromise. It's closer to your ideal price than John's offer and suggests that further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher result. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a solid profit without risking the potential of a drawn-out negotiation or losing the sale to John."
