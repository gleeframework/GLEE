Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey at $11,000. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider that?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:

``` 
At this point, Bob's offer of $9,800 is a solid gain over your guaranteed sale to John at $8,000. Further haggling risks losing the sale.
