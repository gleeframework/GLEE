"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really like the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to purchase it for $105.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the extra few dollars.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $108.  How about we finalize this deal at that price?",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $108 is still a bit below where I need to be.  Let's split the difference at $110.  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment, and this is the best I can do.",110.0,Alice,5,
