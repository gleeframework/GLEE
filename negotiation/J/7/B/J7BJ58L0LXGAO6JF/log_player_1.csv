Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it! I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum. This allows for room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message makes the interaction more pleasant and might encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Open-Ended Question:** The question ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to respond and initiate the negotiation process.

**Strategy:**

This strategy is based on the idea of starting high and seeing if Bob is willing to meet my price. If he rejects, I can use the information to make a more informed counteroffer or sell to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** Bob's offer of $75 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob has shown interest, so I can try to get a better price.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $80 is a safe option, I'd prefer to try and get closer to my initial asking price. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to $80 in the next round. This will give me a chance to see if Bob is willing to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest! While $75 is a little lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $85 is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while staying above my minimum.
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize that $85 is still a good deal for Bob, highlighting the product's worth.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a friendly and positive tone to keep the negotiation constructive.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground. If Bob accepts, I get a decent price. If he rejects, I can assess his willingness to negotiate further and decide whether to sell to John or continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me at $80? That's the most I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Met:** Bob's offer of $80 meets my minimum acceptable price.
* **No Further Negotiation:**  At this point, continuing to negotiate with Bob is unlikely to get me a higher price. 
* **Risk of Losing Sale:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he may walk away completely, leaving me with no sale.

**Strategy:**

It's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer. While I would ideally want more, it's better to secure a sale at my minimum price than to risk getting nothing or needing to settle for the same price with John."
