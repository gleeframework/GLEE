"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This would allow us both to make a profit and reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit more. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a decent profit while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going below $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that I'm willing to sell it to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
