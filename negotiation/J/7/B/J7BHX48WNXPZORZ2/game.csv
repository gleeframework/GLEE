"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but unfortunately $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests and allows us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to offer $950,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This would allow both of us to walk away with a reasonable outcome. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
