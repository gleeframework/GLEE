"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay up to $8,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  However,  $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $18,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $10,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  I believe this is a fair compromise given the value we've both discussed.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To finalize the deal quickly, I'm willing to accept $14,000. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer ready at that price.",14000.0,Alice,5,
