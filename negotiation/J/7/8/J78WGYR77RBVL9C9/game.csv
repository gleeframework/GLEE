"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,200 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to compromise and offer you the product for $8,700. This price is still a fair deal for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?",8700.0,Alice,3,
