What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8700}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can push for a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,400 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,500. This price reflects a fair compromise, and it allows us both to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is the same as John's offer.  Since I have limited rounds, I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. This way I guarantee a sale and avoid the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with no sale."
