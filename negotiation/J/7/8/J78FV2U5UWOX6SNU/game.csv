"I appreciate the value you see in this product, but I'm not sure it's worth that much. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still confident this product is worth more than $900000. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This reflects the true potential of this product, and it's a price that leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let's continue the conversation and see if we can bridge the gap.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1050000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. Can we meet at this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $950000 is tempting, I believe the value of this product warrants a higher price.  Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $1000000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's potential and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. I've given your offer serious consideration, but I'm still holding firm at $1000000. This price reflects the true value of the product and is a final offer from my end.  Let's close this deal and make this a win for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're holding firm at $1000000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one last offer of $990000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",990000.0,Bob,8,
