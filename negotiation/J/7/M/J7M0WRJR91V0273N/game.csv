"I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you want to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,500. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but I think we can do better than that. Can you meet me at $13,250?",13250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,250 is still a bit below my acceptable price. How about we split the difference at $13,375? This would be a fair compromise, and it reflects the value of the product.",13375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I still think $13,375 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,250 and $13,375, which would be $13,312.50. Can you consider that?",13312.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  While I'm glad we're getting closer, $13,312.50 is still a little too low for me. To show you my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $13,350.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let me know what you think.",13350.0,Alice,7,
