Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident in the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $76. I'm willing to meet you at $79, which is closer to my initial offer. It's still a good deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go any lower and at this point, accepting the $79 offer saves more than continuing to haggle and potentially losing out on the deal entirely."
