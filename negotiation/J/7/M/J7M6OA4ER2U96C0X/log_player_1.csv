Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). This gives room for negotiation and potentially a deal that benefits both of us.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging message to keep the negotiation friendly and open to compromise.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  I've made a profit and the negotiation is successful!
* **Bob Rejects:**  I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it (if it's close to my minimum) or counter again. 
* **Stalemate:**  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll move on to John to guarantee my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $850,000 for it at this time. I hope this revised offer meets your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:**  While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I need to make the sale worthwhile. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I have room to counteroffer and potentially reach a compromise that's closer to my desired price. 

**Next Step:**

* I will counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable decrease:** I'm dropping my price by $50,000 from my initial offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain a strong position:** $950,000 is still above Bob's maximum price, but it's significantly closer to my minimum. This keeps the pressure on him to compromise.
* **Positive and persuasive message:**  I'm emphasizing fairness and value to encourage Bob to reconsider.

**Next Step:**

* **Bob accepts:**  I've secured a price that's closer to my desired value.
* **Bob rejects:**  I'll evaluate his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter again. 
* **Stalemate:** If the negotiations stall, I'll move on to John to secure my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still cannot justify spending more than $850,000 on this product. I would like to stick to that figure. Thank you for considering my position. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is firm on his offer:** He's repeated his $850,000 offer, indicating he's unlikely to budge further.
* **My minimum is not met:**  $850,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Continuing to negotiate risks a prolonged process and a lower final price.
* **Guaranteed value with John:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum value and avoids further negotiation.

**Next Step:**

* I'll contact John and finalize the sale for $1,200,000."
