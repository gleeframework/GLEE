"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth a significant amount to you. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but I can't go that low. How about $950,000? It's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000. How about $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $925,000 is still too low. How about we split the difference and settle on $937,500? It's a fair compromise and would allow both of us to reach a deal. ",937500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $925,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers at $931,250.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you.",931250.0,Alice,7,
