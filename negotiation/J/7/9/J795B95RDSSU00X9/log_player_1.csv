Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $1,200,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe the product holds more value. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum price and close to my last counteroffer. Accepting this offer is a good balance between maximizing profit and finalizing the sale."
