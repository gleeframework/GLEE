"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle right between our last offers at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,750, Bob. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. How about we try $10,250? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",10250.0,Alice,5,
