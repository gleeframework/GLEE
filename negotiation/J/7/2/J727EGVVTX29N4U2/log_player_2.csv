Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $92.50, so I'll stick with my previous offer. Would you like to meet me at $92.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice seems firm at $92.50 and is unlikely to go lower. Continuing the negotiation is risky.  It's better to secure the product from John at $120 than potentially end up with no deal and having to buy from John anyway."
