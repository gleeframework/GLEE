"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",850000.0,Alice,3,
