Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $750,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's true value. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.

Reasoning:

* **Closing the Gap:** Alice is clearly indicating a willingness to negotiate, and the price difference is narrowing.
* **Final Offer:**  Her statement that this is her final offer carries weight. It suggests she might not be willing to budge further.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While a counteroffer *might* get a slightly better price, the risk of Alice walking away and forcing a purchase from John at $1,000,000 is too high.  

Accepting at $825,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's price and avoids the risk of losing the deal."
