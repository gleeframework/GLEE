"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price of $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially looking for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could we settle at $750,000?  I feel that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $750,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's true value. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",825000.0,Alice,5,
