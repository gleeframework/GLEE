"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is within your budget, you can likely get a better deal by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer. This allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $85 is a reasonable starting point. This price is below Alice's minimum selling price of $80, but it's also within your budget. This demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is still within your budget, it's still higher than what you're aiming for. There are still rounds left, and continuing to negotiate could lead to a better deal. It's also possible that Alice will come down in price if she wants to avoid going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer from $95 to $100, demonstrating her willingness to negotiate.  It's time to meet her halfway by offering $90. This price is still a good deal for both of us, and it keeps the negotiations moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price point, it's still too high. You have 5 rounds left, and continuing to negotiate could still result in a better deal.  It's likely Alice is trying to gauge your willingness to pay closer to her desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice keeps increasing her offer, so it's time to increase your counteroffer as well. However, it's crucial to maintain a reasonable gap between your offer and hers.  $92 shows your willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below her last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not showing any signs of moving towards your price point. Her offer is now at $110, which is getting very close to the price that John is offering.  With only 3 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice is too high. It's time to cut your losses and buy the product from John for $120.  You might not get the best price, but at least you'll have the product and avoid any further negotiation with Alice."
