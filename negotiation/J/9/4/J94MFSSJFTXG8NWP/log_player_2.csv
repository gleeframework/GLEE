"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her own valuation, it's still higher than Bob's maximum price. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a bold counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount.  $950,000 is a substantial drop from Alice's offer and represents a good starting point for negotiation. This aggressive approach might push Alice to consider a compromise in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above Bob's target. While buying from John is an option, it's better to see if Alice will come down further.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting allows for another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to his target price, and John's offer is a strong backup option. This counteroffer tests the waters, potentially getting Alice to meet Bob's price without needing to go to John.  If Alice rejects, Bob can weigh his options and either accept John's offer or counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above Bob's target price, and there are only 5 rounds left. With John offering the product for Bob's maximum price, it's the most prudent move. Further negotiation with Alice might save some money, but the risk of not closing the deal within the remaining rounds outweighs the potential gain."
