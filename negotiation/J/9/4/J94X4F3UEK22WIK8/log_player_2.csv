{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $12,000 to me, and Alice's offer is too high. I will reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $11,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if she's willing to budge, considering the product is only worth $12,000 to her."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $11,500. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still want a price closer to my target. I'm hoping this will be a more acceptable offer for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is getting closer to my target price, $13,500 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to reject her offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm increasing my offer again to $12,500. This is a significant jump from my last offer, but it's still below what Alice is asking.  I'm hoping she'll be willing to accept this offer, as it's closer to her own value of the product."
