Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) but lower than my minimum ($150). This leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a good starting point.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage and build rapport.
* **Open Ended Question:** Asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and start the negotiation. 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If he rejects outright, I can move on to John. 
* **Start the negotiation process:** If he counteroffers, I can adjust my price based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is below my minimum:** While $125 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to secure a price closer to my minimum or even higher. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not pressured to accept a low price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer that hopefully bridges the gap between our expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $125 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little more. How about $130? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by dropping my price to $130. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a decent profit margin.
* **Highlight value for Bob:**  I emphasize that $130 is still a good deal for him, reinforcing the value of the product.
* **Reiterate my position:** I'm reminding Bob that $125 is not acceptable to me, setting the stage for further negotiation.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:**  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in $130 and agree to the deal. 
* **Maintain my leverage:**  If Bob rejects, I can either make another counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $125 again? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a fair price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** Even with his insistence, $125 is below my acceptable price of $150. Further negotiation would likely be time-consuming and might not result in a better offer. 
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:**  John is a reliable buyer willing to pay my minimum price. This ensures I get a fair price and avoids further negotiation with Bob.
* **Time is valuable:**  Engaging in more rounds of negotiation could take time and effort, potentially leading to a lower offer from Bob or even a stalemate.

Selling to John guarantees a secure sale at a price that meets my minimum requirement, making it the best option in this scenario."
