"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value item for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession to $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
