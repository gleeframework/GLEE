"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $100 is better than $120, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting the initial offer and counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really interested in this product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $90? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Alice's offer:** Alice is offering the product at $95.
* **Alternative:** John is selling the product for $120.

Since Alice's offer is closer to Bob's value and significantly cheaper than John's offer, it's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer and save money."
