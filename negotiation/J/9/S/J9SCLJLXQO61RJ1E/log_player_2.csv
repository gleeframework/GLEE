"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $140. I think it's a great deal for you, as I know it's something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason:  While $140 is better than $150, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you coming back with a price. How about we meet in the middle at $135?  That seems fair given its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reason:  Alice has come down to $135, which is within Bob's budget and a better deal than buying from John.  Accepting this offer is the best option for Bob."
