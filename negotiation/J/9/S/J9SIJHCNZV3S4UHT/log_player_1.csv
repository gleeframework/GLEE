"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum value of $12,000. This will hopefully encourage Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing us to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low for me.  $6,000 is below my minimum value of $12,000, and I'm not willing to sell it for that price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price. How about we split the difference and meet at $7,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below my ideal price. I'm not ready to sell for that price yet. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $7,250 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $8,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
