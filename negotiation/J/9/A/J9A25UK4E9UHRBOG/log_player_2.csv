"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to pay no more than $120. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your target price.  There's room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  This price is still above John's offer, giving Alice some incentive to accept, but it also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $125 is still slightly above my target price of $120, but it's a reasonable compromise.  It's better than buying from John and leaves less room for negotiation in future rounds. There's a chance Alice might come down further, but I'm not willing to risk it."
