Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $800,000, Bob values it much higher. This presents an opportunity to negotiate a price significantly above our minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves a substantial profit margin ($300,000) while still providing Bob a compelling discount compared to his perceived value ($1,200,000).
* **First-Mover Advantage:** By making a strong initial offer, we set the tone for the negotiation and potentially secure a quick agreement.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, we might need to negotiate further. However, starting at a price that reflects the product's high value to Bob gives us the best chance to maximize our profit."
