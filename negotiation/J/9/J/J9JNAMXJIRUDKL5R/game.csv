"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would you consider $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
