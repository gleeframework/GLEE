# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still higher than your maximum budget of $10,000.  You can reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price, or buy the product from John for $10,000. Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate further seems like the best option."
