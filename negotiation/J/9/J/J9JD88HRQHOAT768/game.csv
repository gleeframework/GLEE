"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're committed to your price of $850,000, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of $900,000. It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings to you.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable going. To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $910,000. It's a tough pill to swallow, but I believe it's still a great deal for you.",910000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $910,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm concerned that we're running out of time, and I might have to consider other options.  To show my good faith, I'm willing to go up to $890,000.  This is my final offer.  Let's make this happen.",890000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $890,000. I'm at a point where I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $915,000. It's a tough ask, but I believe it's worth it for the value this product brings to you. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher.",915000.0,Alice,9,
