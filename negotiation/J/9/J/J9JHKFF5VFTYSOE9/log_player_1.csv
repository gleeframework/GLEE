"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $950,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm still confident I can get a better deal with Bob, or if needed, sell to John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my value for it and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's within my minimum acceptable range, and it avoids the risk of a further negotiation that might lead to a lower offer or a deal with John that I'm not fully satisfied with."
