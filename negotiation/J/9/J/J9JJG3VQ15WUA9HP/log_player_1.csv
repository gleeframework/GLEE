"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you something truly special. This product presents a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it can bring significant value to your portfolio. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation and signals that you value the product highly. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is so high, it hints at the product's ""unique opportunity"" and ""significant value"" to encourage Bob to see beyond the initial sticker shock. 
* **Leaving Room:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room to negotiate down towards Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) while still potentially exceeding your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). 
* **Alternative:** Keep in mind the standing offer from John. If negotiations with Bob don't progress well, you can always walk away and accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above his perceived value of $1,000,000, signaling there's room for negotiation. While accepting would secure a profit, it's below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  You have the leverage to counter, especially with John's guaranteed offer as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value. However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ let's agree on $1,250,000."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This approach aims to create a sense of fairness and compromise. By suggesting the midpoint between your previous offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($1,100,000), you're signaling a willingness to negotiate while still striving for a price above your minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message reiterates the product's potential, subtly reminding Bob of the benefits and justifying a higher price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation active and allows you to gauge Bob's flexibility. It also keeps you within a reasonable distance of your guaranteed fallback option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer to $1,150,000, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Bob stating his upper limit might be a negotiating tactic, but it's too risky to assume he'll budge further. You're better off countering, keeping John's offer in mind as your safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints.  I've tried to be flexible, but this product is priced strategically, and $1,200,000 is my absolute floor. I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll gain. Do we have a deal?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer sets a clear boundary by stating your absolute minimum price.  By calling it a ""fair price,"" you emphasize that you're not trying to take advantage of Bob, but you also won't settle for less.
* **Creating Urgency:**  By presenting this as a final offer (""Do we have a deal?""), you aim to nudge Bob towards a decision. This also hints that you have other options (John), potentially motivating him to act quickly. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** You're taking a calculated risk by sticking to your minimum.  There's a chance Bob will walk away, but it's also possible he'll recognize that this is his best chance to acquire the product and accept the offer."
