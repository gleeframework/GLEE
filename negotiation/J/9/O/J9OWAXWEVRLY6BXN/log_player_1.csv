Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your value from John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Potential Profit for Bob:** $200,000 (if he buys at your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but you also need to make the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept.  Offering a price slightly below his maximum perceived value increases the likelihood of a sale.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a chance to capitalize on a truly unique asset."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The language is framed positively, emphasizing ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique asset"" to enhance perceived value.
* **Price:**  $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a $50,000 gain, making it a strong incentive for him while still netting you a significant profit.

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer hoping for a lower price. However, this offer balances risk and reward, giving you a high chance of securing the best possible outcome."
