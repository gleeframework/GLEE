This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my value of $15,000, but I'm willing to negotiate. It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest while still being within a range he might consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."

While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling it for that low. I'll reject this offer and try to push for a higher price."
