"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum value of $120. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe the product is quite valuable, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is my minimum, I can still try to get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. While $120 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $135. It's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 
 
I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm also reiterating the value of the product to justify my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to stick to my budget. I am willing to pay $125 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is only $5 less than what I could get from John. It's not a huge difference, and I don't want to risk further negotiation. It's better to secure the sale and get a slightly better price than my minimum."
