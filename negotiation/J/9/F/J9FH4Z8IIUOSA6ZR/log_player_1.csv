Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than what Bob values the product at, but it also gives me some room to negotiate if he counteroffers. I'm also being friendly and trying to build rapport to make it more likely that we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,050
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $10,050 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I want to get closer to my minimum price of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,050 is still a bit below what I need to make this work. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $11,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,250. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

At this point, Bob is clearly unwilling to come close to my minimum price. While I could continue negotiating with him, I'm getting closer to my deadline and the risk of not getting my minimum price is increasing.  It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John and avoid the risk of a drawn-out negotiation with Bob."
