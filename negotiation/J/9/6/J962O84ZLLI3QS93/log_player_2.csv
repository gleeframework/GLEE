You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to Alice's value as possible without going over his own limit. Offering $8,500 is a significant step down from Alice's offer but still leaves room for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has raised her offer, but it's still within Bob's acceptable range.  Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's better off taking another round of counteroffers, hoping to reach a more agreeable price before having to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a counteroffer closer to Alice's most recent price, showing he's willing to compromise but still pushing for a better deal. He's aiming for a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's offer.  This shows good faith while still trying to save as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice continues to increase her offer, it's now within Bob's acceptable range.  It's still a decent deal for Bob and significantly lower than John's price. It's likely Alice won't go lower, so accepting at this point is the best choice. Further negotiation might result in a higher price, leading to a worse outcome."
