"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I will reject Bob's offer of $8,000. While it's tempting to accept given his low offer, it's still below my minimum price of $10,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $10,000, my minimum acceptable price. This should give Bob a fair price while still ensuring I get what the product is worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I will accept Bob's offer of $9,000. This is a good compromise, as it's closer to my desired price of $10,000 and secures a sale before the remaining rounds."
