"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This offer represents a fair deal for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
