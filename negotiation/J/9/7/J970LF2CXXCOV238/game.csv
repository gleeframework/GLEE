"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's start with a strong offer, and I'm open to discussing a fair price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a more reasonable price. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is too low. It doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise, considering the potential you'll gain from this acquisition.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but I would like to propose a price of $975,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference: I'm willing to accept $1,012,500.  This would be a win-win, allowing you to get the product at a price closer to your initial offer and me to get a better deal than selling to John. What do you say?",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $990,000. I hope this brings us closer to closing the deal.",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close.  I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 for the product. This is the final offer I'll make.  You know the value of the product for you, and this price is fair considering that. If you reject this offer, I'll have to move forward with selling to John.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
