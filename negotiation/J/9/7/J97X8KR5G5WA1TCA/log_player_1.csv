Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I do see its potential,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This would still be a good deal for you as it's significantly above your valuation of $1,000,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
