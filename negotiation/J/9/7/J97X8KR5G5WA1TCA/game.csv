"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I do see its potential,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This would still be a good deal for you as it's significantly above your valuation of $1,000,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is closer to my target, it's still a bit high for me.
