"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to discuss further.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit below that. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about we meet at $1,050,000? I think that's a sweet spot for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your limit. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $1,050,000, but that's as high as I can go. I think we're really close now. Let's finalize the deal at $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
