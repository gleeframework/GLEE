Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your limit. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $1,050,000, but that's as high as I can go. I think we're really close now. Let's finalize the deal at $1,050,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **We're at the limit:** Alice has made it clear that $1,050,000 is her final offer.  Pushing further risks her walking away.
* **Good deal:**  You're getting the product for $450,000 less than John's price.
* **Time is ticking:**  With fewer rounds left, there's less room for negotiation to make a significant difference. 

While you could try one more counteroffer, it's unlikely to yield a much better result and risks losing the deal altogether."
