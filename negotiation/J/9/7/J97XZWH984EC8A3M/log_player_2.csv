"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice. $115 is a bit too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That product looks great, but $115 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer slightly above Alice's value for the product. This gives us room to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $110? That way we both get a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, but $110 is still above our target price. Let's counter a bit lower and see if she's willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $108? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 108
}
``` 

We're inching closer to our target while still leaving some room for negotiation. Let's see if Alice takes the bait."
