I'm starting with my ideal price, hoping to maximize my profit. Since I have a backup buyer in John, I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my price.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to sell for anything less than $1,100,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm dropping my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price that's closer to my minimum. Let's see if Bob will meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, Bob is still significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'll make one last counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise. If not, I'll go with John."

This is my final offer. I've come down as much as I can while still making a profit. If Bob doesn't accept, I'm walking away and going with John."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000

Bob is still not meeting my minimum price. I've already compromised as much as I'm willing to. It's time to move on and sell to John for a guaranteed profit."
