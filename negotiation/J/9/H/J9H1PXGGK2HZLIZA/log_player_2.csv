"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really like it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high, especially considering it's more than you're willing to pay and she values it much lower. There's a good chance to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a price significantly lower than Alice's offer but still a bit above her perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message aims to be polite and frame the counteroffer as reasonable, encouraging Alice to continue the discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $82.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice met me halfway, $82.50 is still above my target price. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand we're trying to find a good middle ground, Alice. How about $75? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I increased my offer to signal I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price below $80.
* **""Fair Compromise"":**  Framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" encourages Alice to accept, especially since it's closer to her last offer than my initial one."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm getting closer to your offer, but I still think $75 is a bit low. I'm willing to meet you at $80, which is my minimum price, but I'm willing to throw in a small discount to sweeten the deal. How about $79.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice has come down to $79.50, which is very close to her minimum and only slightly above my target. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We're already at Round 5, and continuing to haggle over a few dollars might not be worth the risk of the negotiation falling apart.
* **""Small Discount"" Psychology:** While it's a small amount, Alice framing it as a discount might make me feel better about the purchase. 

It's unlikely I'll get a significantly better deal from Alice at this point. Accepting now secures the product at a reasonable price."
