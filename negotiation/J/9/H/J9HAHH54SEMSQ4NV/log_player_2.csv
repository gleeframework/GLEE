"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price. Since you have 10 rounds and John is willing to sell for $1,000,000, you have room to try and get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by 25%. This is a bold move but shows I'm serious about negotiating and aiming for a substantial saving.  We have 9 rounds left, so there's room for further negotiation if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down slightly, it's still too high for my target.  I have several rounds left and can continue to push for a lower price. John's offer remains a safety net, so there's no immediate pressure to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant saving. This is a reasonable middle ground between our previous offers, and I'm hoping Alice will see the value in closing the deal at this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my ideal price, but we're still not there. I have enough rounds left to continue negotiating and push for a lower price. I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a small counteroffer, just $25,000 below Alice's latest price.  This shows good faith and a willingness to meet her halfway. With only 4 rounds left, I need to start closing the gap but am not ready to accept her current offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still not at a price I'm comfortable with. We have 3 rounds left, and there's still room for negotiation. I'm not in a rush to buy from John, and I believe I can still secure a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but this time only slightly. It's important to show Alice that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also setting a firm limit. We're down to the final two rounds, so I need to make a serious attempt to close the deal. I'm hoping Alice sees the value in agreeing to this price rather than risking getting nothing at all in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's down to the wire, and Alice has gone back up to her previous offer of $900,000.  This indicates she's unwilling to budge further.  While I could make one final counteroffer, the risk is too high that she'll reject it, leaving me with no deal in the final round.  

Since John's offer is a guaranteed way to get the product, it's the safest and most logical option at this point.  I'm saving some money, but I prioritize securing the product."
