"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider a lower price? I'd be willing to pay $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $8,500 is still a bit above my budget.  Would you consider $7,000?  That would be a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is still a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $8,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
