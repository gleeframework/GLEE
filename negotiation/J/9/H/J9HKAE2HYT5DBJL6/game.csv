"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too rich for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but  $11,000 is considerably more than I had in mind.  Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice.  However, $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I could go up to $7,000, but that's really the most I can do. It's a fair offer considering the current market.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $7,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $8,250? It's a compromise that I'm willing to make to keep the deal going.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've been considering your offer carefully. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for a similar product for $8,000. I'd prefer to work with you, but I need that price to be competitive. If you're willing to meet that, the deal's done. Otherwise, I'll have to seriously consider the other option.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have another offer on the table, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and my original offer of $11,000. How about we meet at $9,500? It's a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product and the effort I've put into it.",9500.0,Alice,7,
