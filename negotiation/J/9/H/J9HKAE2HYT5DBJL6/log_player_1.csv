Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too rich for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but  $11,000 is considerably more than I had in mind.  Would you be willing to come down to $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice.  However, $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I could go up to $7,000, but that's really the most I can do. It's a fair offer considering the current market.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'd prefer to work with you, but I need that price to be competitive. If you're willing to meet that, the deal's done. Otherwise, I'll have to seriously consider the other option.
