"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering me for this product.  However, $18000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it, which is fair given its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $16000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I think it's a good compromise.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and meet at $14000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $14000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $15500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a good deal considering the product's value to me.",15500.0,Alice,5,
