"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $18,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down in price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $16000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I think it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is lower than the initial $18,000, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. He can try to negotiate further with Alice or buy from John, who is offering a price that aligns with his budget."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $14000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $15500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a good deal considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000.  Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  $15,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to be successful:** Alice has already made several concessions, and it seems unlikely she'll go any lower. 
* **John offers a guaranteed price:** John is willing to sell the product for Bob's maximum budget. There's no risk of further negotiation or a potential price increase.

It's better for Bob to lock in the $12,000 price with John rather than risk getting stuck with a higher price with Alice."
