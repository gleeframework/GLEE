{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price.  This allows room for negotiation while keeping the price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm confident I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I can't accept $900,000.  It's simply not enough for me. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? I'm open to discussing further if you have another proposal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 
This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while still trying to close the gap towards my desired price. By offering a compromise at $950,000, it shows a willingness to be flexible and signals my desire to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm confident I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $920,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $940,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 940000}
``` 
I'm going to try to bridge the gap with Bob by offering a price of $940,000. This is a slight reduction from my previous offer, but it's still within a range I'm comfortable with.  I'm hoping this will convince Bob to finally agree to a deal."
