"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I can't accept $900,000.  It's simply not enough for me. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? I'm open to discussing further if you have another proposal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider my offer?",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $920,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $940,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen.  What do you say?",940000.0,Alice,5,
