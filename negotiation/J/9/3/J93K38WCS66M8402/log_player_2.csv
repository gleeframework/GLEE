"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me, but still gives you a good price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below the product's true value to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to spend closer to $1,200,000. Would you consider $1,300,000? It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,300,000 is still quite a bit below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,350,000 is still higher than Bob's desired price point.  He should continue negotiating to try and get closer to his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's try $1,325,000. It's a good middle ground, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $1,337,500.  This would be a good deal for both of us and I believe it's the best we can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,337,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,337,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, $1,337,500 is still above his budget.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better price. There are still five rounds left to reach a better deal, so he has time to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to get this deal done, but $1,337,500 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  It's a fair price for both of us and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me. We're nearing the end of our negotiation. To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $1,312,500. This is my final offer,  let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,312,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,312,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is running out of time and Alice's final offer is still above his budget.  It's better for him to take the guaranteed lower price from John, even though it means not negotiating further with Alice.  With only three rounds left, the chances of getting Alice to go lower are slim, and the risk of not closing a deal is too high."
