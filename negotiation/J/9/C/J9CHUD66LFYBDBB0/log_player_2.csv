"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is offering it for $120. While this is a decent price, you can potentially do better by negotiating.  It's worth seeing if you can get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Fair Price:**  $100 is a fair compromise between Alice's offer of $120 and your maximum value of $150. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Leaving some room for Alice to counter allows for further negotiation and potentially a more favorable outcome.
* **Avoiding John:** While John's offer is a backup, it's preferable to try and secure a better deal with Alice if possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $110 is a good price for you.  It's lower than John's offer and closer to your ideal price point. 
* **Limited Rounds:** We've already used two rounds and have only 8 left.  There's a risk of further negotiation pushing the price up or running out of time before getting a better deal. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting this offer minimizes the risk of losing the product to someone else or ending up with a worse price than John's offer."
