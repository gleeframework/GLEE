Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, offering it to Bob first gives me a chance to potentially earn even more.
* **Finding a Balance:**  Bob values the product at $120, so I need to offer a price that's attractive to him while still exceeding my minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $135 is a strong starting point. It leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle but still ensures a good profit margin if he accepts outright."
