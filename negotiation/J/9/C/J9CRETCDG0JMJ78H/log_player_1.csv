{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $15,000.  It's in excellent condition and would be a great asset for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This is a starting point. It's important to consider:

* **The product:**  What is it?  The more unique or desirable it is, the higher you can potentially price it.
* **Bob's potential value:**  Is he known to be a shrewd negotiator?  How much do you think he's willing to pay?
* **Your risk tolerance:** Are you willing to risk a lower price to secure a sale quickly, or are you prepared to negotiate for a longer time to try and get closer to your ideal price? 

Good luck with your negotiation!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be interested in buying it for $8000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I need.  While $12,000 from John is a guaranteed sale, I'm going to try and negotiate a better price with Bob.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. $8,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in buying this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum than Bob's initial offer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm not ready to settle yet. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
