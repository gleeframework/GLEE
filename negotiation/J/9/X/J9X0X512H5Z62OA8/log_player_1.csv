Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to let go of the product for $1,000,000 (your deal with John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. 
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit but also ensure Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal, increasing the chance of rejection.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and would be a wise investment on your part."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** Creates a sense of exclusivity and emphasizes the product's value to Bob.
* **The Price:** $1,150,000 splits the ZOPA almost evenly. This leaves both you and Bob with a significant profit:
    * Your Profit: $150,000 ($1,150,000 - $1,000,000)
    * Bob's Perceived Value: $50,000 ($1,200,000 - $1,150,000) 

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Dynamic:**  Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly, but remember your minimum. 
* **Information is Key:** This example assumes you don't know how much Bob is *willing* to pay, only the maximum value the product holds for him. If you had more information about Bob's budget or urgency, you could adjust your strategy accordingly."
