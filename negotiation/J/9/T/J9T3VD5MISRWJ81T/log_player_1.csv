"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product is impressive, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move forward, I could consider a price of $1,200,000. This reflects the product's unique qualities and potential return on investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1200000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $1,200,000 is still too high for my budget. Could we meet in the middle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer price, but it's still significantly below both my minimum ($1,000,000) and John's standing offer. It's worth another counteroffer to see if I can negotiate Bob closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $750,000 is closer to a fair price, it's still a significant gap from what I can accept.  Let's try to find a sweet spot - would you consider $1,000,000? This is my firm bottom line to make this work."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm now at my absolute minimum selling price. This offer reveals to Bob that I'm serious but also willing to make a deal.  His next move will be critical in deciding whether to continue negotiations or go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems we're getting closer.  While $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This is the highest I can go. Let me know if it works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has now explicitly stated that $800,000 is his highest offer. This is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and it's not worth risking further negotiation. John provides a guaranteed sale at my desired price, making it the most logical choice at this point."
