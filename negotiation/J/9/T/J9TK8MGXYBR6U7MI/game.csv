"Hello Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price of $15000. It's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me in the middle at $12500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $13750. It's a fair price considering the product's quality and value.  Let me know what you think.",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13750 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12000, which is the price I was initially offered by John. Can you meet me at that price or lower?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $12000.  How about we meet in the middle at $12500? That would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $12500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11800. Can you meet me at that price or lower?",11800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting close to the end of our negotiations. I'm willing to go down to $11500, but that's really my bottom line. If you're not able to reach that price, I may have to consider other offers.  Let me know if you're willing to go up to $11500.",11500.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to go up to $11200. Can you meet me at that price?",11200.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort, but $11200 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10500 as a final offer.  If you're not able to accept this price, I'll have to move forward with another offer. Let me know your decision.",10500.0,Alice,9,
