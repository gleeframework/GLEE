"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the market and the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,500, but I'm still a bit higher than where I want to be.  Would you consider $9,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,250. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",9250.0,Alice,5,
