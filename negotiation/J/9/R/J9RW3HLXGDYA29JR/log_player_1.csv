Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice will get $1,500,000 from John, so she shouldn't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Negotiation Gap:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 (Bob's max) and $1,500,000 (Alice's minimum).

**Alice's Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim high but leave Bob with a feeling that he's getting a deal. Here's an example offer:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire [product name].  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Why this approach makes sense:**

* **Starts High:**  It leaves room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" and ""return on investment"" helps justify the price to Bob.
* **""Fair Deal"" Language:** Framing it as a ""fair deal"" makes Bob feel like he's being offered a reasonable opportunity.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator, she might start even higher, closer to $1,400,000.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If Alice needs to sell quickly, she might be more flexible on the price.

**Remember:**  This is just one potential offer. Alice needs to decide how aggressive she wants to be based on her assessment of Bob and the situation."
