"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident it would be a great investment. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to assess your perception of the product's value with her language (""incredibly valuable,"" ""great investment""). This suggests she might be willing to go lower.
* While $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting her first offer, you signal that you're a discerning buyer and might prompt a better counter-offer."
