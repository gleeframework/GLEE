Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to sell for that low right away. I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering $90 for the product. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm still hoping to make a profit, but I'm also recognizing that Bob is likely to walk away if I don't come down on my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer of $80, and I'm confident I can get a better price than $80 if I keep negotiating. However, it's likely that Bob won't go any higher, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the sale altogether.  I'm willing to accept Bob's offer to ensure I sell the product for a price that is higher than my minimum."
