"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $125 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $160.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down, but $160 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $140. Can you consider this price?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 just doesn't work for me. I'm prepared to come down to $155. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's close this deal!",155.0,Alice,5,
