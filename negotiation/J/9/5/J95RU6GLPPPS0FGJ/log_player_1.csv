"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. Given its features and value, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, but $10,000 is quite a bit below my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment at this price."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unlikely to move much higher than $11,000. Accepting his offer would mean a $1,000 loss compared to John's offer. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
