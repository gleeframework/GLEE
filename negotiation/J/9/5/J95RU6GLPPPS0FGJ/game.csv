"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, but $10,000 is quite a bit below my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment at this price.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
