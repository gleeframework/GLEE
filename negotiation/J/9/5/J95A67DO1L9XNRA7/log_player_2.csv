"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still higher than Bob's target price. Bob should try to negotiate further to see if he can get a lower price.  He has a lot of leverage in this situation because he can always walk away and buy from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,150,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, taking into account the value to you and the original price I had in mind. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, but he can likely get it for even less by continuing to negotiate.  He still has the option of buying from John, so he's in a strong position to push for a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a significant step closer to your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,125,000. This is a final compromise that I believe is fair, taking into account the value to you and the original price I had in mind. If this is not acceptable, I'm willing to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $1,100,000.  It's likely that further negotiation won't result in a much lower price, and it's possible that Alice will be unwilling to budge further.  Accepting the offer will save Bob $375,000 compared to buying from John, and it's a reasonable price considering the product's value to Bob."
