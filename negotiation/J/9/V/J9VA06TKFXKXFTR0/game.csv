"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $155. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $155 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $140. Would you be willing to consider this price?",140.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $150. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $145. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more compromise, Alice. However, $145 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go as high as $135, but I think that's the maximum I can afford. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",135.0,Bob,6,
