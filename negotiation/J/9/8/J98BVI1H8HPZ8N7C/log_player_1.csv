This offer starts at a high price but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to balance maximizing profit with maintaining a good relationship with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can't afford $9,500 for the product. Can you lower the price a bit? I'm willing to pay up to $8,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob's offer is close to what John is offering, I'm not ready to give up just yet. I still believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering what it's worth to you.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I still can't afford $9,000 for the product. Could you consider lowering the price further? I'm willing to pay up to $8,750. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, and it's only $250 less than what I could get from John.  At this point, I'll accept his offer to avoid further negotiation and potential risk of losing the deal entirely."
