"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but $1,200,000 seems a bit steep for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000 yet. I believe it's worth more. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your offer, $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $1,000,000.  This price reflects the value of the product to both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I was thinking $900,000 would be a more reasonable price. I'm getting closer to my target, but I'd like to save as much as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer of $900,000. It's a good price considering he's already rejected my previous offers. It's important to close the deal, and I don't want to risk losing him entirely."
