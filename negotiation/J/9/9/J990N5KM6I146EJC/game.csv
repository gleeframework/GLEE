"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but $1,200,000 seems a bit steep for me.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your offer, $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $1,000,000.  This price reflects the value of the product to both of us. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I was thinking $900,000 would be a more reasonable price. I'm getting closer to my target, but I'd like to save as much as possible.",900000.0,Bob,4,
