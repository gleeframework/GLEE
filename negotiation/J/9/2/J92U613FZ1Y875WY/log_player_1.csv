Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a fair price considering it's worth $120 to me and $80 to him.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below what I consider a fair price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but it's still a fair price considering it's worth $120 to me. I'm hoping this will be acceptable to Bob and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $95.  While it's still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to what I want, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in another round.  It's also a much better price than selling to John for $120, since that would involve a significant loss of potential profit."
