"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is closer to her valuation than mine. There's room for negotiation. I'll counter-offer and see if she's willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it leaves me room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to make this deal happen.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is moving closer to my range, and $11,500 is a reasonable compromise. It's a better deal than John's offer, so I'll accept."
