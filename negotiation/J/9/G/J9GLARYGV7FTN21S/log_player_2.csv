"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to go down to $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that's closer to his budget, but still leaves room for negotiation.  He's showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product, but also that he's not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is closer, I'm still a bit away from my desired price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I believe this price is fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still above what he's comfortable with. Bob wants to save as much money as possible and believes there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $9,500.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again making a counteroffer that's closer to his maximum budget. He's showing Alice that he's willing to negotiate further, but also that he's not going to significantly increase his offer. This keeps the pressure on Alice and hopefully leads to a deal that's closer to Bob's target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's try $10,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is closer to his maximum budget, it's still above what he's comfortable with. Bob believes he can push for a lower price, and he wants to avoid overpaying. It's worth trying to negotiate further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $10,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go to $9,750.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it gets us closer to a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 9750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again proposing a price closer to his maximum budget while still leaving some room for negotiation. He's aiming for a price slightly higher than his offer from Round 4, showing he's serious about making a deal but not willing to go much higher.  This keeps the pressure on Alice and might push her to accept a price closer to his ideal range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,750 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to an agreement. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. Although Alice's offer of $10,250 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still a bit too high. Bob believes he can still push for a lower price and wants to avoid overpaying. He wants to see if he can get Alice closer to his desired price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to go to $9,875. This is a fair price that gets us both closer to our desired outcome. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9875} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a slight increase from his previous offer, showing that he's willing to meet halfway. He's aiming for a price that's closer to his ideal range, but still leaves room for Alice to compromise. This strategy keeps the negotiation moving and might encourage Alice to accept a price closer to Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're almost there. I'm willing to come down to $10,125. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to close this deal. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has negotiated as much as he can with Alice. While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it is still above his maximum budget. With only one round left, it is highly unlikely that Alice will accept a lower price. Bob is better off purchasing the product from John for $8,000, ensuring that he stays within his budget and avoids overpaying."
