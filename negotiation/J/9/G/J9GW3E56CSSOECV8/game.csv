"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000,  which still provides a good value for you and allows me to cover my costs. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",950000.0,Alice,3,
