# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value and could greatly benefit your operations. I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000.

{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, but I'm not comfortable going any higher.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  However, $850,000 is considerably below its true worth and my initial offer was a good-faith attempt to find a middle ground. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget.  While it's a step in the right direction, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'll continue to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4

Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions is still significant. I need to see a more substantial increase to continue this conversation. I'm willing to consider $1,600,000 as my final offer. This is a firm price, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```
