It's better to reject Alice's offer.  You can get the product for $100 from John, so there's no reason to pay more than that.  Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Let's try a slightly higher counteroffer of $88. We're still below John's price, but we're showing some flexibility and willingness to negotiate."

Alice is getting increasingly stubborn and the price keeps going up.  At this point, it's better to just buy from John.  He's offering a fair price and we're running out of rounds."
