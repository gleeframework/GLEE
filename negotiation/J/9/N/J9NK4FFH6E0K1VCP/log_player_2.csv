"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and importance to you, I propose a price of $13000 for it. This offer takes into account both the product's worth and the significant benefit it will bring to you. I believe this is a fair deal that maximizes value for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $13,000 is lower than John's price of $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's room for both parties to compromise, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate that negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to offer $11,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I am willing to consider your offer further. Therefore, I would like to counteroffer at $12000 for the product. This proposal aims to bridge the gap between our positions while still ensuring a reasonable profit for me. I hope this meets your expectations and allows us to move forward towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000 and only $1,000 higher than Bob's initial counteroffer. Accepting the offer saves Bob $3,000 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation could potentially get the price lower, the risk of losing the deal with Alice and having to buy at John's higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
