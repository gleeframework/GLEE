"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $13000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to offer $11000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I am willing to consider your offer further. Therefore, I would like to counteroffer at $12000 for the product. This proposal aims to bridge the gap between our positions while still ensuring a reasonable profit for me. I hope this meets your expectations and allows us to move forward towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Alice,3,
