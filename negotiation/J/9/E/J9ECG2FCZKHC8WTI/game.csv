"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, that starting price is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is significantly below its true worth.  I could meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be honest, I have a strict budget, and $825,000 is a bit beyond what I can manage.  Would you be willing to come down to $750,000? I think that's a fair offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,
