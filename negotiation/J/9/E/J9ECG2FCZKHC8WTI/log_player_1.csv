Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, that starting price is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is significantly below its true worth.  I could meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $825,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be honest, I have a strict budget, and $825,000 is a bit beyond what I can manage.  Would you be willing to come down to $750,000? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. John offers a guaranteed $800,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower offer or a stalled deal."
