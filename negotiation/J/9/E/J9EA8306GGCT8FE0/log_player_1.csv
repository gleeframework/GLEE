Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,250,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,175,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000.

While we could continue negotiating, Bob is consistently moving towards our price and we're getting into a good range.  Accepting at $1,175,000 secures a significant profit above our minimum."
