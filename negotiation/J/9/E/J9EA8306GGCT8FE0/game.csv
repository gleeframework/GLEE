"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,200,000 undervalues its potential. I could meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to propose $1,150,000. I think that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing your eagerness to make this deal work, and I appreciate that.  While $1,150,000 is closer to a fair price, I can't let this go for less than $1,250,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a win-win for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,250,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,175,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
