Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I believe it offers excellent value, even at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it at $150 (its value to you), there's a chance Bob will reject it. Aiming slightly lower increases the likelihood of a sale and a profit above your minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested but finds the price a tad high.
* **John as a Backup:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, so there's no pressure to go below your minimum acceptable price."
