"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $1200000 is a bit too far off from what I need to sell the product.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  This still reflects the value of the product to me, but it's a step closer to your offer.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

I'm still not comfortable with $1750000. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?,1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I understand you're not comfortable with $1750000. I'm willing to drop to $1600000, which is closer to your offer but still reflects the true value of this product. This is my final offer before I consider other options. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
