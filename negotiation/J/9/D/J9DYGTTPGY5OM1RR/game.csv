"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price seems a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your feedback.  I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $12,500 is still a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground.  I could be flexible and come down to $12,000, which is my absolute bottom price. This is a fantastic deal for this product.",12000.0,Alice,5,
