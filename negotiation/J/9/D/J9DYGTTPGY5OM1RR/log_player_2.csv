"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high, considering her product's worth to her is significantly lower. There's a good chance to negotiate a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price seems a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to bring the price down significantly closer to Alice's valuation while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your feedback.  I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, but $12,500 is still above her own valuation. There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $12,500 is still a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to split the difference between her previous offer and our last counteroffer, showing a willingness to move closer to her price while still pushing for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground.  I could be flexible and come down to $12,000, which is my absolute bottom price. This is a fantastic deal for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to her own valuation of the product. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and this price is well within your budget.  It's a good deal!"
