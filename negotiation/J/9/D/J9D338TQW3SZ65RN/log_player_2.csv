"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe its value is significant, and I'm confident it can bring you great benefit. My starting price is $1000000.  Let's discuss this further.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, and you don't know the product's true value to her. You're better off rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential benefit it could bring me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Lower:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.
* **Fairness:** While $750,000 is a substantial amount, it is still a reasonable price to consider for a potentially valuable product.
* **Openness:** The message emphasizes a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This still allows for a substantial return on investment for you, while also ensuring a fair price for me. I'm confident this product can exceed your expectations, and I'm eager to see us both succeed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still closer to her initial price than to your counteroffer. While it's lower than her original asking price, it's still significantly higher than your ideal price point. Since you have 7 rounds left, you have time to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. I'm still aiming for a lower price to make sure the investment is worthwhile for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.  This price reflects my desire to reach an agreement while still considering the potential value of the product. Let's keep working towards a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
