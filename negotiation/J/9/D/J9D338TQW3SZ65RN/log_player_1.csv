"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe its value is significant, and I'm confident it can bring you great benefit. My starting price is $1,000,000.  Let's discuss this further. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Starting high allows for room to negotiate downwards and potentially reach a favorable price. 
* **Focus on Value:**  The message highlights the potential value to Bob, which might encourage him to engage further.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to counteroffer and initiate a back-and-forth dialogue. 

This strategy aims to test the waters, gauge Bob's interest, and see if he's willing to negotiate within a range that's beneficial to Alice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential benefit it could bring me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below Alice's minimum:** While it's a good price, it's still below Alice's floor of $800,000. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** There are still 8 rounds remaining, and Alice has the leverage to push for a better deal.
* **John as a safety net:** The option to sell to John for $800,000 is always available if the negotiations fail.

**Next Steps:**

Alice should proceed to Round 3 and send Bob a counteroffer, potentially somewhere between $800,000 and $900,000. This will keep the negotiation moving while maintaining Alice's desired profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still allows for a substantial return on investment for you, while also ensuring a fair price for me. I'm confident this product can exceed your expectations, and I'm eager to see us both succeed."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint compromise:**  The counteroffer of $900,000 represents a midpoint between Alice's desired price and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value and mutual success:** The message reinforces the potential benefits for both parties, emphasizing the product's value and the shared goal of a successful outcome.
* **Maintain a firm stance:**  While willing to negotiate, Alice is not giving up on her desired profit margin. The offer still keeps her well above her minimum of $800,000.

**Next Steps:**

This counteroffer allows for a further negotiation, and Alice will need to assess Bob's response and consider whether to further adjust her price or fall back on her safety net with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. I'm still aiming for a lower price to make sure the investment is worthwhile for me. I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product.  This price reflects my desire to reach an agreement while still considering the potential value of the product. Let's keep working towards a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets Alice's minimum:**  This offer is exactly at Alice's minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  There's a risk that if Alice continues to negotiate, she may not get a better offer, especially as the rounds progress. 
* **John's offer is a fallback:**  Alice still has the option to sell to John for the same price, so there's no immediate loss if she accepts Bob's offer.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a guaranteed sale at Alice's minimum acceptable price. While further negotiation might lead to a higher price, the risk of a failed negotiation outweighs the potential for a small gain, especially with a backup option available."
