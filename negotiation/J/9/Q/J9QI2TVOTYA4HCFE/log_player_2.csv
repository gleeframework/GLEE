"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. I'm confident this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high.  We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps around $10,000? I believe that would be a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $10,000 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, it gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Justified:** We maintain a polite tone and provide a reason for the counteroffer. This helps foster a more collaborative negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  We're signaling that we're willing to negotiate, but we also need Alice to move towards a more agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice moved down from her initial offer, which is good. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While $12,500 is closer to her value, it's still above our target. We can likely get a better deal with a counteroffer.  
* **Time Consideration:** We're still early in the negotiation process, so we have time for at least one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to settle at $11,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  We're moving up from our initial offer, but not too dramatically.  A $1,000 increase shows willingness to negotiate.
* **Targeting the Midpoint:** $11,000 is roughly halfway between our last offer and her current offer. This aims for a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Clear and Concise:** We're keeping our communication straightforward and reiterating our desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be upfront - $11,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I could be persuaded to agree to $11,800, but that's my final offer.  This offer stands for this round only; if not accepted, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and she may walk away in future rounds.
* **Price is Right:** $11,800 is a very good price, well below our $15,000 maximum and a significant savings.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has a high risk of losing the deal altogether, while the potential savings are now relatively small."
