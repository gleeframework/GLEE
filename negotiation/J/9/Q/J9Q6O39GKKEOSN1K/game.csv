"Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $12,000. This is a high-quality item that I believe would greatly benefit you, given its value to me is significantly higher than this price. I look forward to your consideration.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  This is my highest offer, as I can get a similar product from John for $8,000. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet within your budget. However, I must respectfully decline your offer. To ensure we reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose a price of $9,500 for the product. I believe this price reflects the quality and value of the item while remaining within your stated budget constraints.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $9,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.  If this doesn't work for you, I will have to go with John's offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,
