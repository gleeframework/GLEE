Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible while still making the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $12,000, so we need to offer a price that's appealing but doesn't leave too much money on the table. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate the price down.  

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob while having the safety net of John's guaranteed purchase."
