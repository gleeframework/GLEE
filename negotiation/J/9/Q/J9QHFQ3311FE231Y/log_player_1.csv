"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob responds before making any further decisions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $90 is close to my minimum, but I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $95. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this will be agreeable to Bob, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $92 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate."
