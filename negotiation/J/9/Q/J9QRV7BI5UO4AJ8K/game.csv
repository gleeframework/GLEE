"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. I am willing to pay $10,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. Looking forward to your response!",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer and still a fair deal considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $10,500 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle and allows us to reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating. While $10,500 is closer, I still need to make a bit more than that.  How about $11,000?  I believe this is a good compromise for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,
