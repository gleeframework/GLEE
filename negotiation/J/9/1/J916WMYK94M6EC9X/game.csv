"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000.  This price reflects the significant value this product can bring to your business, and it still leaves some room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. To be completely transparent, my budget limit is $1,200,000. That's the most I can justify spending. If you can meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
