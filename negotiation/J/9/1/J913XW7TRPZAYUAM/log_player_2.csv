"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential benefits to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering.  There's room for negotiation since Alice values the product at $1,200,000 and Bob's maximum is $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, I'm only able to offer $950,000 at this time.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential benefits you've outlined."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is significantly below its true worth.  I could consider letting it go for $1,050,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,050,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Since John is willing to sell for $1,000,000, it makes more financial sense for Bob to purchase the product from John.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will result in a lower price, and Bob risks losing out on the product entirely if Alice rejects any further counteroffers."
