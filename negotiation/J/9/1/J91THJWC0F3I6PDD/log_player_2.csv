"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of significant value to you.  While I can't disclose all the details right now, I can assure you it's worth at least $800000 to me. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. This represents a substantial opportunity, and I believe it will be mutually beneficial. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a better price with Alice or proceed with John's offer, which is still within his budget."
