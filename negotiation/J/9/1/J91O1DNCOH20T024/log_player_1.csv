"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high, at $10,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully maximize my profit.  I'm also aware of John's offer of $8,000, which acts as a safety net if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my ideal price, I still believe I can get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $9,750.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. Hopefully, this will be enough to close the deal without risking losing him entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $9,600 is a good price, and I'm getting closer to my ideal price.  While I could try to squeeze out a little more, there's always a chance he'll walk away, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
