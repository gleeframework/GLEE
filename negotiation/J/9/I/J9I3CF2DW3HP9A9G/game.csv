"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $2,000,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and the potential return on investment. Can you meet me at this price?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,500,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
