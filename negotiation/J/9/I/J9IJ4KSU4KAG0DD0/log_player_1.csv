Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,100,000. I know this product is of significant value to you, potentially saving you considerable resources and boosting your profits. This offer stands for 24 hours, after which it will be extended to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 aims to secure a price significantly higher than John's offer ($800,000) while remaining attractive to Bob, who values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Creating Urgency:**  The 24-hour deadline introduces a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision swiftly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is $1,100,000, the message's tone leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob attempts to counter-offer. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has a reasonable understanding of Bob's valuation and business context."
