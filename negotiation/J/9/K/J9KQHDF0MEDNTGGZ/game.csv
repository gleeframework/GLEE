"I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $800,000 for the product. I think it's a bit steep at $1,200,000. Can you consider my counteroffer?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum. This price still allows you a significant gain as you value the product at $1,000,000. Let's meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. Can you consider this compromise?",950000.0,Bob,4,
