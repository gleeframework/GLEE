Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

Since I know I can sell the product to John for $12,000, I'm going to offer Bob the same price.  There's no reason to offer a lower price, as I'm guaranteed to make the same amount either way.  While Bob values the product less, he might still be willing to pay the price if he believes it's a good deal."
