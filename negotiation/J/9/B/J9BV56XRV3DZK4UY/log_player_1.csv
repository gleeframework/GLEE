Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a bit higher than my minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

$100 is too low for me. I'm going to try and get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $130. This is still a bit higher than what I would sell it to John for, but I'm hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $110 is still better than selling to John for $120. It's important to balance maximizing profit with the risk of losing the deal entirely."
