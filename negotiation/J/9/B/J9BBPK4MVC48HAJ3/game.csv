"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to me is high, but I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about we aim for $750,000? I hope this proposal works for you.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? I'm confident this price is still attractive to you considering the product's value, and it allows me to reach a fair outcome.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I must respectfully decline. Considering the value I place on the product, I am unable to agree to $850,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
