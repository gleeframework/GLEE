"Alice,  $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget and my assessment of the product's value. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 as a starting point for negotiation. This reflects the product's worth to me, while leaving room for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this offer. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is quite significant. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1,400,000.  This price would allow both of us to make a reasonable profit.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
