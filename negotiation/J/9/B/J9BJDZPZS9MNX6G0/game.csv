"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $750000.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $950000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $850000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $850000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you at $975000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I think it's a fair price that reflects the product's value to you.",975000.0,Alice,5,
