"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for $900000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you won't want to pass up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, you can likely get it for even less.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate and try to reach a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is still better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, so rejecting this offer will allow you to continue haggling and potentially get a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $850,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $850000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you at $975000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I think it's a fair price that reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, and $975,000 is a good deal compared to John's price of $1,200,000. Further negotiation might be possible, but there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and you'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting the offer is the most prudent choice, as it saves you $225,000."
