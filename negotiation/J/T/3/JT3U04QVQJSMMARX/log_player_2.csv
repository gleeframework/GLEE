"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $140 is still above Bob's maximum price point of $120.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I'm interested, but $140 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $125.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to his maximum as possible while still leaving room for negotiation. Offering $125 is a reasonable starting point, as it's a significant reduction from Alice's initial price but still leaves some room for Alice to make a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $125 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  That's a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $135 is still above Bob's maximum price point.  He's willing to pay $120, and it's worth trying to negotiate further before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $130?  I'm confident we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to inch closer to his target price of $120. Offering $130 is a compromise, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate while still staying within his budget. This approach might make Alice more likely to accept the offer, or at least come closer to his desired price in the next round."
