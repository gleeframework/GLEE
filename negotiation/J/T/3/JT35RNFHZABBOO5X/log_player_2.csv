Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly signaling this is her final offer.  While I could try to push for $800,000, there's a real risk she walks away. Accepting at $825,000 secures a significant discount from both her starting price and John's offer."
