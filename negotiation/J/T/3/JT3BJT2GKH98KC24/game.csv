,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $8,500. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product has for you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, I'm still finding it a bit high. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500, as I mentioned earlier. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $8,250?",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $8,250 is a little too close to my top end.  I'd be willing to close the deal right now for $8,100.  What do you say?",8100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $8,200?",8200.0,Alice,7,
