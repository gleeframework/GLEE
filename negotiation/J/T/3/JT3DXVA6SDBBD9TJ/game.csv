"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, reflecting its value to me. This is a fair price given my financial constraints.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $750,000. Considering its value to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, given the value you place on the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850,000 is still out of my range. I'm firm on my previous offer of $750,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and my budget limitations.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your commitment to your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $750,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, given its value to me.",825000.0,Alice,5,
