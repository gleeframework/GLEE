Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I believe we can find a better balance. How about we aim for a price closer to $900,000? I think it's fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, considering the value this product brings. I believe this price is still fair for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I still believe we can reach a more equitable solution. How about we consider $1,050,000 as a compromise? This would allow me to invest more in the product while keeping my costs reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,050,000 is less than my ideal price, it's still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer will guarantee a sale and save time on further negotiation."
