Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. We've taken into consideration all the discussions we've had, and we are pleased to offer the product at $835,000. We believe this price reflects the value of the product while remaining within your budget constraints.

We've negotiated Alice down significantly. While another round *might* yield a slightly better price, there's also the risk Alice could become firmer in her position. Accepting at $835,000 secures a good deal and avoids the risk of ending up with John's $1,000,000 price."
