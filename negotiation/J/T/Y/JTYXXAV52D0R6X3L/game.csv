"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,200. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about $7,500? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go as high as $7,500. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $8,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
