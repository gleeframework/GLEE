Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm not willing to go as low as $100, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we try $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go below $110.  While getting the product for $110 is a decent deal, buying from John guarantees the best price at $100. There's no point in further negotiation if your absolute limit is $100."
