"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. I am willing to pay $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can secure a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not quite there yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired value.  I'm confident that I can get a better price, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer. I'm willing to drop to $10,250. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and your previous offer.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your efforts to meet my budget constraints. I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached an impasse with Bob. He's refusing to budge from $10,000, which is still lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to risk losing too much time and potentially missing out on a better deal.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to a more promising buyer.  John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is much closer to my desired value.  I'm confident that I can secure a higher price with John."
