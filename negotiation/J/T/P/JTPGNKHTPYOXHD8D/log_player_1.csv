Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While the product holds value for me, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for it. This would still leave you with a significant profit and allow me to acquire the product within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
