"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While the product holds value for me, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for it. This would still leave you with a significant profit and allow me to acquire the product within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $925,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a good compromise for both of us. This would allow me to acquire the product within my budget and ensure you still receive a substantial profit. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $875,000. I'll offer you the product for $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
