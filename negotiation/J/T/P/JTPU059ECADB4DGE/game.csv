"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our exclusive product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to me and the potential for negotiation, I'd like to offer $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,150,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
