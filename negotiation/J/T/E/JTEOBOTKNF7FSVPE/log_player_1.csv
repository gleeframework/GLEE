Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,500. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000.  Offering it at $11,500 allows Alice to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($500).
* **Avoid Leaving Money on the Table:**  If Alice asks for less than $11,500, she risks losing potential profit.
* **John as a Safety Net:** While Alice aims high, she knows John provides a guaranteed $10,000. This allows her to confidently negotiate with Bob without the fear of losing out completely.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While Alice knows Bob's valuation, there's always a chance Bob might try to negotiate a lower price. Alice needs to be prepared to counter-offer or walk away if Bob's offer goes below her acceptable threshold.
* **One-Shot Negotiation:** This scenario presents a single offer. In real-world negotiations, there's usually more back and forth."
