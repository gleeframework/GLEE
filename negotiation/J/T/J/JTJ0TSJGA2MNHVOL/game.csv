"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is unfortunately far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which still represents a great value for you. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $13,000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. Would you consider $9,500? I think that's a fair price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $9,500 is still lower than my ideal price, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This would be a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $10,000. That's definitely closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping for a little more.  Would you consider $11,500? It's a compromise, and I believe it's fair for both of us given the product's value. We're running out of time, so let's make a decision that works for everyone.",11500.0,Alice,7,
