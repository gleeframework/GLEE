"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counters, and it also signals that I believe the product has value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm not willing to sell for less than that, so I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counteroffering at $85. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $78 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.  With 6 rounds left, it's not worth risking a continued negotiation that could lead to a lower price or a failed deal altogether.  It's better to accept Bob's offer now and secure the sale."
