"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that I have a backup buyer in John who will pay my minimum. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I want to reach a deal, I'm not willing to compromise too much. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to show some flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum.  I believe this counteroffer is reasonable and might convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get him closer to my target price. The deal with John is always an option, but I want to try and get the best price possible from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price again to $11,000, which is closer to Bob's offer.  I'm trying to find a middle ground where we can both be happy with the deal. If Bob rejects this offer, I might consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, it's getting risky to keep negotiating with Bob.  His offers haven't moved significantly, and I'm concerned I might not get a price that's close enough to my minimum. To secure a good price, I'm going to sell the product to John."
