"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You want to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation. It's a significant drop from Alice's price, but it still leaves room for a compromise. The goal is to get closer to Alice's desired price while still getting a deal below your maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle. How about $11,000? That's still a great price for you, considering the value it holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but $11,000 is still above your target.  You can continue negotiating to try and get the price lower.  There are still multiple rounds left, and you might be able to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's split the difference. How about $10,750? It's closer to what I can afford, and still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to move the price down while still showing a willingness to compromise. It's halfway between Alice's last offer and your previous one, demonstrating that you're actively seeking a solution.  This could potentially entice Alice to accept, as it's a significant move towards her desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your offer. While $10,750 is closer, it's still a bit below my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $10,900. This would be a fair compromise and a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is very close to your target price of $10,500, and it's significantly cheaper than John's offer of $12,000.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal and minimizes your expenditure.  While you could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially going back to her previous offer of $11,000 outweighs the potential benefit of a few hundred dollars in savings."
