"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle. How about $11,000? That's still a great price for you, considering the value it holds.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's split the difference. How about $10,750? It's closer to what I can afford, and still a good deal for you.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your offer. While $10,750 is closer, it's still a bit below my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $10,900. This would be a fair compromise and a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.",10900.0,Alice,5,
