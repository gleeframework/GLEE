Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your creative approach, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,080,000. I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, but I need to stay firm on my minimum price. I'm willing to give you one more chance to meet me at $1,080,000. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly signaling that $1,080,000 is her absolute bottom line.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely she'll budge further, and we risk her walking away from the deal entirely. Accepting at this price secures a significant discount from both her initial offer and John's price."
