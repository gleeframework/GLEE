"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, aiming to justify the high initial price. 
* **Open Communication:** The tone is friendly and encourages Bob to share his thoughts, setting the stage for a constructive negotiation. 

This strategy balances a strong opening position with a willingness to negotiate, increasing the chances of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than your desired outcome. You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed option if needed. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Bob that you're serious about getting a higher price while keeping the negotiation alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers unique value, and I believe a price of $1,950,000 reflects its worth more accurately. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** We've lowered the price from $2,000,000 to $1,950,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:**  We re-emphasize the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of the potential benefits.
* **Midpoint Movement:** This counteroffer aims towards a price around $1,900,000, which is closer to the middle ground between your initial ask and Bob's offer.

This strategy maintains a firm position while encouraging Bob to engage in a more meaningful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob meeting you exactly in the middle is a strong signal of his final offer. Holding out for more might push him away entirely.  $1,900,000 is a significant profit above your minimum, and securing the deal now removes the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
