"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. I believe it's a fair deal, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. While I recognize the value of the product, $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $11,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $13,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,500 is still a bit above what I can afford right now. I'm willing to offer $12,500, which is a significant move closer to your last offer. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,
