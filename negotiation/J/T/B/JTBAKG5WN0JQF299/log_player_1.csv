Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. While I recognize the value of the product, $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $11,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.
