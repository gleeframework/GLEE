"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $8,500. It's a fair price considering the value you place on it.",8500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I think $8,200 is getting closer to the sweet spot, but I'd like to get a bit more. How about we meet at $8,800? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",8800.0,Alice,5,
