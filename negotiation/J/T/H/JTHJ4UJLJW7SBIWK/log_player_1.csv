"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially get a better price than John's offer, while also leaving room for Bob to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $125? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $125 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further, so I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about $135? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135, which is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price of $150 but leaves room for further negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will find this counteroffer more appealing, but I'm still prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $135 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $130? That seems like a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to continue negotiating, so I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $132. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 132}
```

I'm offering $132, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this will be enough to persuade Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to go up to $131, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $131. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $131
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $131 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and it's clear that Bob is unlikely to budge much further.  It's not worth risking further rounds of negotiation with Bob and potentially getting stuck with a price below my minimum. John is offering a guaranteed $150, which is a more secure and profitable outcome for me."
