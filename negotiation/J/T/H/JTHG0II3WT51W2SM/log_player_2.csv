Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit far from your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $10,250. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?

At this point, Alice has made it clear she's not willing to go below $10,000.  It's not worth further negotiation to save only $250, especially since you have a guaranteed offer from John at $10,000."
