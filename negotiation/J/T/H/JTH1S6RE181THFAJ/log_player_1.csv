Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth in the right hands."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" aims to frame the price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 gives me leverage. I don't need to desperately lowball the price.

**Goal:**

The ideal outcome is for Bob to accept this initial offer, netting a significant profit. If he negotiates, I'm prepared to come down slightly, but never below $1,500,000."
