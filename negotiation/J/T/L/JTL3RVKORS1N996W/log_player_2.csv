Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $700,000 is a bit low. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, which is closer to the product's true value to me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit.

**Reasoning:** At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below $800,000.  She knows your walk-away price and is trying to maximize her profit. It's better to secure the product from John at your target price than risk Alice not budging further."
