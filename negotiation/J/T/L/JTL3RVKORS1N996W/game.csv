"I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit too high for me. How about we meet closer to the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $700,000 is a bit low. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, which is closer to the product's true value to me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit.",850000.0,Alice,5,
