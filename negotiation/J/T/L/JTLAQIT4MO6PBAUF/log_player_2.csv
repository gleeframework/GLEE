You have three options:

It's always good to try to negotiate and see if you can get a better price.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's room to try and save more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

Let's start by offering $850,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and shows that you are serious about negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is reasonable, and we've already saved a significant amount. It's better to accept and avoid risking further negotiation rounds that might not yield a better price."
