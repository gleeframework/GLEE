"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you in the long run. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit lower. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price that gives you a great deal, and allows me to cover my costs. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but unfortunately, $9,750 is still not a price I can accept. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but my costs are higher than that. Let's meet in the middle again. Would you be willing to consider $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would be a significant investment for you. ",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's the maximum I can afford. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,6,
