"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product to create a good first impression. 
* **Strategy:** I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his perceived value ($80).  If he rejects, I can adjust my price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $95 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is close to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:** Show Bob that I am not desperate for a quick sale.
* **Signal my value:** Demonstrate that I believe the product is worth more than his offer.
* **Explore a potential compromise:**  In the next round, I can counter with a price closer to his offer but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $95.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm reducing the price to $105, which is still above my minimum and shows some flexibility.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's point while reinforcing the value of the product. I'm also framing the price as a ""fair"" compromise.
* **Strategy:** By sticking to my minimum price range, I'm showing I'm not willing to sell at a loss.  The counteroffer is a step in the right direction, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my research and budget, I would like to propose a price of $98 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is very close to my minimum and shows a willingness to negotiate, I still believe I can secure a slightly better price. Here's why:

* **Minimum Value:** $98 is just $2 above my minimum of $100.
* **Remaining Rounds:** I have 6 rounds left, and by rejecting this offer, I can explore further negotiation and potentially achieve a higher price. 
* **John as an Alternative:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $100, providing a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail.

By rejecting this offer, I maintain leverage and signal to Bob that I'm not desperate to sell at a price close to my minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with your offer. $98 is a good number, but I'm still feeling a bit below my ideal price for this product. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. This is a final offer from me, and it's a fair price considering the value you'll get.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $100, my minimum price and the same price that John is willing to pay. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and emphasizing the ""fair"" price and value of the product. I'm also stating this is my ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage acceptance.
* **Strategy:**  By sticking to my minimum and framing it as a ""final offer,"" I aim to nudge Bob into accepting the deal. If he rejects, I can fall back on John, ensuring a guaranteed sale at my minimum price."
