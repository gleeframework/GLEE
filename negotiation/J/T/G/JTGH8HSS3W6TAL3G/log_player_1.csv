"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is above my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start high to see what Bob's true value is. If he's willing to pay close to this, I'll know I'm in a good position to get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price.  I have 10 rounds, so there's still room to get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum value and leaves room for further negotiation. I'm hoping this will be a more acceptable price for Bob while still allowing me to get a good deal."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating. I still have 6 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a higher price."

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous counteroffer, but it's still above my minimum value. I'm hoping that by showing a willingness to negotiate, I can encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I have 4 rounds remaining, and I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'm not going to accept his offer just yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,200,000. This is my absolute minimum acceptable price, and I believe Bob may be willing to meet me at this point. If he doesn't, I'll consider selling to John for the same price, as I'm not willing to go lower."
