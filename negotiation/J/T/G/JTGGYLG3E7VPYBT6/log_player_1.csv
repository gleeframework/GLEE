Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice values the product at $1,500,000, so she won't sell for less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **John's Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000.

**Optimal Strategy**

Alice knows she can get her minimum price from John. Therefore, she should aim to get as much as possible from Bob, knowing that if Bob refuses, she doesn't lose anything.  This means pushing the price towards Bob's maximum valuation.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,199,999.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it brings."", ""product_price"": 1199999}
```

**Why this approach?**

* **Pricing below Bob's Valuation:** By pricing slightly below Bob's $1,200,000 valuation, Alice increases the chances of Bob accepting. 
* **Creating Urgency:** The message implies the product's value and potential, subtly encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:** This initial offer opens the door for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can decide if she wants to go lower or stick closer to her $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Risk Tolerance:** This strategy assumes Alice is slightly risk-averse. There's a small chance Bob might reject the offer, and Alice would then sell to John at her minimum."
