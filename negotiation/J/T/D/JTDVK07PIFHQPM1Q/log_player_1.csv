Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,300,000. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to seize this chance."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Secure the Sale:** Offering it at $1,300,000 gives Bob a $200,000 discount, a strong incentive to buy immediately. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I still have John as a guaranteed buyer at my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).

By starting high, but leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal, I increase my chances of a quick and profitable sale."
