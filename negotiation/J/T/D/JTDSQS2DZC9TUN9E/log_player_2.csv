"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $12,000 and Alice is offering the product for $12,000, there's no benefit to negotiating further. Buying from John for the same price guarantees the purchase without any risk of a longer negotiation process."
