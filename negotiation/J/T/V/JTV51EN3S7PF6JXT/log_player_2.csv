"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $150. I believe it's a great deal for its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $150 is significantly higher than both your maximum budget ($100) and John's offer ($100). It's in your best interest to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $80."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to give us room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Reasonable Target:** Aiming for $80 is a good starting point. It leaves space for a potential compromise while still representing a significant discount from both Alice's asking price and John's backup offer.
* **Expressing Interest:**  We don't want to discourage Alice completely. By stating our interest and suggesting a specific price, we signal that we're serious about buying but need a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  $80 is quite low, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to an acceptable price, $115 is still above both your $100 limit and John's $100 offer. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $115 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Would you consider $95? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:** Alice is willing to negotiate, so we're incrementally moving towards a potential agreement.
* **Strategic Counter:**  $95 is a significant jump from our previous offer but still below our $100 limit. It shows we're willing to meet closer to the middle ground.
* **Framing as Compromise:** By phrasing our counteroffer as a ""fair compromise,"" we appeal to Alice's desire to find a mutually agreeable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $95 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I could go down to $105, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now firm at $105, which is still above your $100 budget.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower. You have a guaranteed option with John at $100, meeting your budget. It's time to cut your losses with Alice and secure the product at your target price."
