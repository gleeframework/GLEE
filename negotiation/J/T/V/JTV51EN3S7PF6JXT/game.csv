"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  $80 is quite low, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $115?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $115 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Would you consider $95? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $95 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I could go down to $105, but that's my final offer.",105.0,Alice,5,
