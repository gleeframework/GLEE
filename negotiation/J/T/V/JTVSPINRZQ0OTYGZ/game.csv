"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $100. This is a high-quality item worth significantly more than its face value, and we believe this price reflects its true worth while still being accessible to you.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you valuing your product highly, but $100 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of our product. After considering your offer, I would like to propose a price of $95 for the product. This is higher than my initial offer but lower than my original asking price. I hope this proposal works for you.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $92.50?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. Considering your latest offer, I would like to suggest a price of $94 for the product. It's a bit higher than your proposal, but I believe it's a fair compromise given the value of the product.",94.0,Alice,5,
