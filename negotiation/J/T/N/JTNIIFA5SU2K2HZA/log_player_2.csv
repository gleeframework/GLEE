"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,800,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,800,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1500000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1,700,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,700,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his target. It's worthwhile for Bob to continue negotiating and see if he can push for a lower price. There are still 7 rounds remaining, so he has time to explore further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to profit, but $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,600,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're close, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,700,000 and $1,600,000, which is $1,650,000. Let's see if we can shake on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,650,000 is closer to Bob's goal, it's still a little too high. Bob has already rejected a similar offer in the previous round. He can continue negotiating and see if he can push Alice closer to his desired price. There are still 5 rounds left, giving Bob time to explore options before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,650,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,625,000, which is a fair middle ground. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1625000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we're close, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,625,000, but I'd like to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a personalized consultation with the product's creator. How about we call it $1,675,000 for the whole package? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,675,000 is still above Bob's budget and while the additional extras are a tempting offer, it's time to weigh the risks. Bob has 3 rounds remaining, but Alice is showing signs of being unwilling to go lower.  Buying from John for $1,500,000 offers a guaranteed price within Bob's budget and eliminates the risk of further negotiation failures."
