Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. My price is $130, which is a fair deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly approach:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm mentioning the product's value to justify the price.

This approach aims to maximize my potential earnings while still being open to a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the value, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $90 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I want to make a sale, I'm not willing to accept such a low price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to try and get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  Instead of a flat rejection, I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value (again):** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Friendly tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly tone to keep the negotiation open.

This approach aims to find a middle ground that is more favorable for me while still giving Bob a chance to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've given your proposal some thought, and I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. I would like to offer $100 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise considering its value. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round. There's still a chance I can get closer to my target, especially since Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which I believe is a fair compromise.  This is my final offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm indicating this is my final offer to signal seriousness and pressure Bob to make a decision.
* **Compromise:** I'm still offering a compromise, but I've lowered my price by only $10 from the previous round. This shows I'm not willing to go much lower.
* **Direct language:** I'm using direct language to get to the point and avoid further back and forth.

This approach aims to secure a price that's closer to my minimum while also recognizing Bob's budget constraints. If he rejects, I can confidently move on to John without feeling I left money on the table."
