{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** I'm offering the product for $1,000,000, which is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing it as a win-win situation. 
* **Strategy:** This strategy aims to:
    * Get a higher price than Bob's initial valuation while still leaving room for negotiation.
    * Create a sense of urgency by hinting at the possibility of selling to another buyer if Bob doesn't accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still achieve a better deal. My minimum is $1,200,000, and Bob is willing to pay $900,000. There is still room for negotiation. 
* **Strategy:** By rejecting his offer, I can leverage his interest and potentially secure a higher price in the next round. I can counteroffer with a price slightly above $900,000, showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better deal. 
* **Risk:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees my desired outcome, but I'm taking a calculated risk by continuing negotiations. The potential for a higher price from Bob outweighs the guaranteed return from John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best price, and I appreciate your offer. However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Price:** I'm offering the product for $950,000, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a better price. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a good price, but I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and the fairness of my counteroffer.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer aims to:
    * Show a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong position.
    * Increase the pressure on Bob to accept the offer, as it's closer to his previous offer.
    * Gauge Bob's true interest in the product and his willingness to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:**  Bob's offer of $920,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's so far below my value. 
* **Strategy:** I'll continue to counteroffer, but I'll be more firm. I'll aim for a price closer to $950,000, demonstrating that I'm willing to compromise but not at the expense of a significantly lower price. This will show Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair deal.
* **Risk:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is always an option, but I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I'm confident that by staying firm and counteroffering, I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $935,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll receive from the product.  Let me know if you're ready to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 935000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Price:** I'm offering the product for $935,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $950,000 and Bob's offer of $920,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while maintaining a firm stance.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's continued negotiation but highlighting the fairness and compromise of my counteroffer. The message also urges Bob to finalize the deal, adding a sense of urgency.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer aims to:
    * Show Bob that I'm serious about negotiating but won't accept a price significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.
    * Encourage Bob to accept the offer by presenting it as a fair compromise that's close to his previous offer.
    * Create a sense of urgency by suggesting that this could be the final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $935,000. I'm willing to pay $915,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:**  Bob's offer of $915,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. We have been negotiating for a while, and it seems Bob is not willing to come up to a price that is acceptable to me. 
* **Strategy:** At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me my desired outcome and saves me the time and effort of further negotiation.
* **Risk:** Continuing with Bob would risk lowering the final price or dragging out the negotiation process further. It's better to secure the guaranteed profit from John."
