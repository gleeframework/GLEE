"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob to encourage him to consider it. 
* **Room for compromise:** This leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, and potentially reach a price that benefits both of us. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I have John as a backup at $120 gives me confidence to push for a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $100 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is closer to my minimum:**  While $90 is closer to my minimum of $120, I believe I can still do better. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob's willingness to negotiate shows there's potential to reach a mutually beneficial price.
* **Potential for higher offer:** I'm confident that I can push for a higher price in the next round, possibly even getting closer to my initial $100 offer.
* **John is still an option:** Having John as a backup at $120 gives me the security to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $100. Would you be willing to go up to $95? This is a fair price that reflects the product's value."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm increasing my offer by $5, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Justifying the price:** I'm reinforcing the product's value to encourage Bob to consider my counteroffer.
* **Strategic compromise:** This counteroffer allows for a potential final agreement within the next few rounds, while still keeping my profit higher than $90.
* **John is still an option:** Having John as a backup gives me confidence to hold firm and potentially push for a higher price in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $95. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While $87.50 is closer to my minimum of $120, it's still below what I consider a reasonable price for the product. 
* **Negotiation still possible:** Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, indicating a potential for a higher price in the next round.
* **Potential to increase the offer:** I believe I can push for a higher price in the next round, potentially getting closer to my previous offer of $95.
* **John is still a backup:**  Knowing I have John as a backup at $120 gives me the security to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $87.50 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $91.25? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 91.25}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:**  By splitting the difference between $87.50 and $95, I'm showing willingness to compromise while still pushing for a higher price. 
* **Framing it as a win-win:** I'm emphasizing that this price is fair for both of us, making it more appealing for Bob.
* **Pushing towards the middle ground:** This counteroffer puts us closer to the middle ground between our initial offers, increasing the likelihood of reaching an agreement.
* **John is still a backup:** Knowing I have John as a backup gives me the confidence to continue negotiating for a higher price, potentially closing the deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $91.25 is the best price. I'm willing to go up to $88, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While $88 is closer to my minimum of $120, it's still below what I consider a reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.
* **John is a better option:**  The fact that Bob is now threatening to buy from John for $80 means I can confidently reject this offer. John's offer of $120 is much more appealing.
* **Negotiation may not be productive:**  Bob's ""final offer"" statement suggests that further negotiation might be unproductive. 

Since John is offering a significantly better price, it's more beneficial for me to sell the product to John and secure a profit."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $90. I understand you're considering buying from John, but I believe my product is worth more than $80. How about we meet in the middle at $89? This would be a fair compromise, and a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 89}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **John's offer as leverage:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's threat to buy from John, but I'm also subtly reminding him that my product is worth more than $80. This sets the stage for a potential compromise.
* **Meeting in the middle:** Offering $89 shows willingness to compromise while still staying above Bob's final offer of $88.
* **Final attempt to reach agreement:**  This counteroffer represents my final attempt to reach an agreement with Bob. If he rejects, I'll confidently move to sell to John. 
* **Confidence in John:** My backup offer of $120 from John gives me the confidence to stand my ground and push for a slightly higher price."
