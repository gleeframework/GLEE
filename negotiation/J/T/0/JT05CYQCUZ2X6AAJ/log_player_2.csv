# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $15,000 by you. Considering its exceptional quality and unique features, I believe we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. I propose selling it to you for $12,000. This price reflects the value you see in the product while ensuring a fair return for me. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
