""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below your guaranteed price allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Psychological Pricing:** The slightly uneven price of $14,500 might seem more appealing than a round number like $15,000. 

This offer aims to achieve the highest possible price while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
