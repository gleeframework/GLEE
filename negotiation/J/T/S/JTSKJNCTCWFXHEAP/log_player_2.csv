"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am excited to present our flagship product, which I believe could significantly enhance the value and efficiency of your operations. Given its unique features and benefits, I estimate its true worth to be $1,000,000 from your perspective. However, considering the investment we've made in research, development, and market positioning, I am offering it to you at an exclusive price of $800,000. This represents a substantial saving for you while still allowing us to recover a fair portion of our costs.

Please let me know if this offer aligns with your expectations and budget. We are confident that this product will bring significant returns on your investment and look forward to discussing how it can best serve your needs.

Best regards,
Alice

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,000,000 and also less than John's offer. Accepting her offer saves you $200,000 compared to buying from John."
