Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product,  $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to purchase the product for $12000, which is my maximum budget.  Let me know if you're open to that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
