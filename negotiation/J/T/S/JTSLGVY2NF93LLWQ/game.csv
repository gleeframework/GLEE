"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be happy to purchase the product for $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $8,800. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8800.0,Alice,3,
