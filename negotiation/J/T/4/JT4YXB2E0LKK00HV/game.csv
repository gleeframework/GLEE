"Bob, I have a unique product I believe you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us. How about we start with $2000000? This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see its value. Let me know what you think.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
