Could we perhaps aim for a price closer to $1,700,000? This would be a more feasible option for me while still respecting the value of the product.

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for more, Bob is clearly pushing his upper limit and another round might lead to him walking away.  $1,750,000 is a significant profit over my minimum, and it's better to secure a deal now than risk losing him entirely."
