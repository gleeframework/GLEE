"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's below your maximum budget, there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, potentially saving a significant amount of money.
* **Avoiding the ""John"" default:** Buying from John is your last resort, as it represents the highest price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives us both a good margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to negotiate further. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This price still reflects the value I place on the product, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.

* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice rejecting your offer again and potentially increasing the price.
* **Better than John's offer:**  Accepting Alice's offer saves you $125,000 compared to buying from John."
