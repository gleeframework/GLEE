"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives us both a good margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to negotiate further. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This price still reflects the value I place on the product, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,
