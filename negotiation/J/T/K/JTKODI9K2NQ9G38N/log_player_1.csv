"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $175 is still significantly lower than what I could get from John, giving Bob some room to counteroffer. 
* **Positive Message:**  A friendly and encouraging message may make Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150.
* **There's room for negotiation.** I can still counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is a safe option, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.**  

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired value, but still lower than what I could get from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $125? This is still a great price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffering with a reasonable price:** $125 is a compromise between Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable value.
* **Maintaining a positive and encouraging tone:**  Using phrases like ""split the difference"" and ""great price"" keeps the negotiation friendly and encourages Bob to consider my counteroffer.
* **Still leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not giving up on my goal of earning more, but I'm also not pushing Bob away with an unrealistic price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $110 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value.** $110 is closer to my desired price, but it's still not enough for me to consider selling it at that price. 
* **I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to be firm.**  I can't just keep lowering my price, as I'm losing money with every reduction.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed safety net.**  While I want to get the best price possible, I don't want to risk losing money.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob again, but this time I will be more firm and try to push the price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but $110 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $115 as a final offer. If you're serious about getting the product, let's make this happen.  This is my best price, so let me know if you want to move forward."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** $115 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, showing I'm serious about earning at least that much.
* **Finality:**  The message emphasizes this is my ""final offer,"" creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to make a decision.
* **Closing Statement:** ""Let me know if you want to move forward"" encourages a response and keeps the negotiation active. 

**Why not just sell to John?** 

While John's offer is safe, I'm still hoping to get a better price. $115 is a decent profit, and I haven't yet used up all my negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your last offer and I'm willing to pay $112 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob has moved closer, $112 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150.
* **Risk of losing out:**  With only 4 rounds left, I risk losing a better deal with John by accepting this offer.
* **Room for a final push:** I'm not completely out of negotiation room, and there's a chance I can get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob one last time, aiming to push the price up to my minimum acceptable value or very close to it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm firm on this. My final price is $114. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do. It's your call, but if you don't accept, I'll be moving on to other buyers."", ""product_price"": 114}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** I'm pushing the price closer to my minimum acceptable value ($150) while leaving a small margin for negotiation.
* **Stronger Language:** I'm using more assertive language (""firm,"" ""final price"") to convey that I'm not willing to budge much further.
* **Creating Urgency:** I'm emphasizing that I will move on to other buyers if Bob doesn't accept, putting pressure on him to make a decision.

**Why $114?**

* It's a good compromise, balancing my desired profit and the likelihood of Bob accepting.
* With only 3 rounds left, I need to be assertive to secure a decent price.
* I'm still keeping the option of selling to John as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. I am willing to pay $113 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $113. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $113
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds left, the chances of reaching my desired price are slim. 
* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $113 is not enough for me to feel like I'm getting a fair deal, considering the value of the product to me.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed safe bet:** By selling to John, I can ensure a profit and avoid the risk of a low price from Bob.

**Conclusion:**  While I'm not thrilled about settling for John's offer, it's the most sensible decision given the limited time and the likelihood of a better price from Bob."
