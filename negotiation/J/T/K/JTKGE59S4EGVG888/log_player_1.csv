Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $100 to me, I'll start with a price that's slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 120}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer of $100. Since this is the same price I was willing to sell it to John for, I think I'll take the sure thing and sell it to John.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}"
