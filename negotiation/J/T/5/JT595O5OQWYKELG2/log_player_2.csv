"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still close to my maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. I have 9 more rounds to try, so there's time to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a tempting price, but I'm looking to get a better deal. Would you be willing to sell it for $850,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $100,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal. It's a reasonable offer, but also leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire for a better deal, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $850000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met me halfway by offering $900,000, which is a significant drop from her initial price. Accepting this offer would allow me to save $50,000 compared to buying from John. While I could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject my counteroffer and leave me with no choice but to buy from John at a higher price. It's wiser to secure this deal and save the money."
