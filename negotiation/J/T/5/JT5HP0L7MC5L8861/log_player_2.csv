"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget, meaning there's no potential for saving money by accepting her offer.
* You know John is willing to sell the product for the same price. 
* Since there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer and the same outcome is guaranteed with John, it's more logical to buy from John."
