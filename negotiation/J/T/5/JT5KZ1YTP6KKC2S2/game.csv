"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $2000000. This is a fair price considering its exceptional features and benefits. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to meet in the middle, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to stay above my minimum price. Let's try $1800000. This is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and what similar products are selling for in the market. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1800000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again?",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay close to my minimum price. Let's try $1700000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession, but $1700000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",1400000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to feel that we're getting a bit far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to prioritize my minimum price. Let's try $1600000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. If we can't meet at this point, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet at a price that I'm comfortable with, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to stay above my minimum price. Let's try $1500000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. If we can't meet at this point, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,9,
