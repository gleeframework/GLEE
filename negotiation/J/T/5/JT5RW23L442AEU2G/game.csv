"I have a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value product that will greatly benefit your business. I'm open to negotiating the price, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. I'm starting with an offer of $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I believe the product holds value, $15,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to offer $8,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, but $8,000 is a bit low considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $12,000 is still above my budget.  How about $9,500? I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting closer, but $9,500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle now.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and your desire to get a fair price.  To meet you closer to the middle, I'm willing to increase my offer to $10,500. This is the best I can do, and I believe it represents a good deal for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more than $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can seal the deal.",11500.0,Alice,7,
