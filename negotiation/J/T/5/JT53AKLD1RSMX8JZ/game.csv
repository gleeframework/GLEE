"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  Given its potential, I'm confident this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, $20,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer and your perspective on the value. While I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, $10,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  Could you consider something closer to $17,000?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position. To be honest,  $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
