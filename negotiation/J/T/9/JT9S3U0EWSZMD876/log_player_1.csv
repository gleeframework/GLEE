{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you. Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you leverage in negotiations. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $1,400,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($1,500,000 - $1,200,000 = $300,000) while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 with John provides a safety net. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob."
