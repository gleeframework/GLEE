"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $80? That's the maximum I'm able to pay right now.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $110. It's a great price, and I think you'll really love the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $95? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to take it off your hands.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go down too much further. I'm willing to meet you at $105. It's a great price, and I think you'll really love the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to meet you at $90. That's my final offer.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to meet you at $100. It's a great price, and I think you'll really love the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. If you're willing to go down to $95, I'll take it. Otherwise, I'm going to have to pass and go with another seller.",95.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go down too much further. I'm willing to meet you at $98. It's a great price, and I think you'll really love the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",98.0,Alice,9,
