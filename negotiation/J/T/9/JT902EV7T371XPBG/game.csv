"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it gives you a good deal.  What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to offer $1,550,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's close this deal!",1550000.0,Bob,4,
