Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it gives you a good deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still $100,000 above my maximum budget. 
* I'm not willing to pay more than $1,500,000, and I'm confident that I can get a better price with further negotiation.
* I'll counteroffer again with a price closer to my maximum."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to offer $1,550,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1550000}
