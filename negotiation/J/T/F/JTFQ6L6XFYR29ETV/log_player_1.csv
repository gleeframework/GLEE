Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $900,000.  This is a good starting point, as it's higher than the product's worth to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can lower my price slightly, but I don't want to go too low too quickly.  I also want to make sure I get as much money as possible, as I'm not under any pressure to sell to Bob immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my ideal price, I think I can still get a bit more. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $875,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping that this price will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but still allows me to get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is getting too low with his offer.  While I could counter again, the negotiations are getting lengthy and I'm risking losing the sale.  I'm better off selling to John for $800,000 - it's a guaranteed sale at my minimum price."
