Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm proposing a price of $14,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice needs at least $8,000 to be satisfied. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $14,000 allows Alice to capture a significant portion of the value Bob places on it. This price leaves Bob with a potential surplus ($1,000), making it more likely he'll accept the offer. 
* **Backup Option:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $8,000 provides a safety net. However, Alice aims to maximize her profit by securing a deal with Bob at a higher price."
