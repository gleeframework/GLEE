"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price. He has a safety net with John, so he can afford to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his budget, and he's already successfully negotiated a lower price. Rejecting this offer allows him to potentially get the product for an even lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,650?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10650}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $11,200. It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's still a great compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,200 is still a good deal for Bob.  He's saved $800 compared to John's price, and further negotiation might not yield a significant enough price drop to justify the time and effort."
