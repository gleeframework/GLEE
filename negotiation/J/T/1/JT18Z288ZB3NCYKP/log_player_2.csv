Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $145. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $145.  At this point, it makes more sense to buy from John for $150 and avoid further negotiation."
