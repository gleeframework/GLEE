"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",155.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $155 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little steep for me. How about $135? That's a fair compromise, I think.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $145. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",145.0,Alice,5,
