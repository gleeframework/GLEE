Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $100. I believe it's worth much more, but I'm aiming for a quick and easy sale."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit vs. Guaranteed Sale:** While I could aim for a higher price closer to Bob's perceived value ($120), this carries the risk of him rejecting the offer.  
* **Splitting the Difference:** By offering the product at $100, I'm splitting the potential profit ($120 - $80 = $40) with Bob. This makes it a fair deal for both parties.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $80 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the $100 offer, I still gain a profit of $0. 

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of losing the sale to Bob."
