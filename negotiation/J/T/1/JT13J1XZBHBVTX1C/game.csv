"Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1500000. It's a unique opportunity with a lot of potential value. Let me know what you think!",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to offer $750000 for it.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer, but $750000 is significantly below what this product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1100000? This is a substantial discount from my initial offer and a fair price considering the value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product. I'm trying to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $850000 is still too low. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to go down to $950000. This is a final compromise from my side, and it's still a good deal considering the product's potential.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your compromise, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $850000, as I mentioned before. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,6,
