"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $800,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be worth the same to you. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This price reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,1,
