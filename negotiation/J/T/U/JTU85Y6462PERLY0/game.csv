"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, $900000 is simply too low for me. Given the value of this product, I'm prepared to offer a counter-proposal of $1000000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the substantial benefits this product brings to your business.  Let's find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's worth to me is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm proposing a price of $950000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
