Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant improvement from Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."

Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
