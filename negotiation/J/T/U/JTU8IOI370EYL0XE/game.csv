"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair deal considering its value and the potential risks involved.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that still allows both of us to make a profit. Let's find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
