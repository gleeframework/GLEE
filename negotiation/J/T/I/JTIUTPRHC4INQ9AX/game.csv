"I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for both of us to benefit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the distance we've come in our negotiations.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and the progress we've made. However, $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,012,500. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
