"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I suggest we start our negotiation at $95. This price reflects not only the product's worth but also ensures a fair return for me. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's opening offer of $95 is too high. 
* You know you can get the product for $100 from John. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away unless she offers a better price. There's a chance she'll lower her price to make a sale."
