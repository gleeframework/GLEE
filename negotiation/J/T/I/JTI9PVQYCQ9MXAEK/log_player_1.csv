"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,800 for the product. Let's see if we can find a common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll try a counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $7,800 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for the product.  How about $8,200?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant at $8,200.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and avoids any further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer more, it's the best I can get from Bob at this point, and it's the same price I can get from John. I'll accept the offer and close the deal."
