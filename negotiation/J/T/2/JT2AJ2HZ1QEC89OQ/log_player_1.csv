Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, hoping to get a good deal. Since I have a backup offer from John, I'm not afraid to risk losing this deal and I'm confident I can get at least my minimum asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is higher than my minimum asking price and is a good compromise considering his valuation. Accepting this offer ensures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
