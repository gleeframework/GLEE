"Alice,  $2,000,000 is way above my budget.  I'm really interested in the product but  I'm only able to go up to $1,200,000 right now. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true worth. How about we meet halfway at $1,600,000? This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product.  However, $1,600,000 is still above my comfort zone.  Let's split the difference and meet at $1,400,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
