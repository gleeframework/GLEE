"I'm really interested in the product, but $22000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $22000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $15000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $19000. It's still a great deal considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $17500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and uniqueness. If you're still interested, let me know. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",17500.0,Alice,5,
