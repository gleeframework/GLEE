Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob could net you an extra $1,500.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The $11,500 price point is still a significant discount for Bob compared to the product's worth to him ($10,000).
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob immediately saves you the time and effort of going to John. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, the potential reward of a higher profit makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
