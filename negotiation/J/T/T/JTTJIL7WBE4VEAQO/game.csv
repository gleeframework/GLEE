"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you value the product at $800,000, but it's worth significantly more to me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This price still gives you a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that the product is worth more to you, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price. I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a fair compromise that allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good deal. Let's make this happen!",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work. Let's be realistic -  this product is worth a lot more than that to both of us. I'm willing to compromise a little further and offer you the product for $1,525,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs and ensures a successful deal.  I'm confident that this is the final offer we can both be happy with.",1525000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers and propose a price of $1,487,500. I think this is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value to both of us.",1487500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,487,500 simply won't work for me.  I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product for $1,500,000. This is my absolute minimum, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. It's a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal now.",1500000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've gone as high as I can, and I'm afraid I'll have to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'm willing to make one final offer of $1,475,000, and that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $800,000.",1475000.0,Bob,10,
