Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly above your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a profitable outcome. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering the product at $175 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants a better deal, while still ensuring you earn more than your minimum.
* **Considering Bob's Valuation:** While you know Bob values the product at $150, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more if he perceives the product as valuable or scarce. 

**Important Note:** If you were to engage in multiple rounds of negotiation, you would need to adjust your price based on Bob's responses and your confidence in securing a deal with John."
