"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $13,000. This is a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! However, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,000 for the product?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about $11,500? That's a fair compromise, I think.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not at a comfortable price with $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you",13000.0,Alice,5,
