{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $9,000 is above your maximum budget of $10,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's room for negotiation, and you haven't exhausted your 10 rounds yet.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  My counteroffer of $8,500 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating my commitment to negotiation. 
* **Fairness:**  This price is still above Alice's desired $8,000, suggesting a potential win-win scenario.
* **Leaving room:**  There's still room for further negotiation if Alice rejects this offer.
* **Balancing risk:**  While I could go lower, I want to avoid stalling too much early on, as I need to consider the limited rounds and the option of buying from John."

* **Remaining within my budget:** This offer is still within my maximum budget of $10,000, while still being lower than Alice's last offer.
* **High-stakes negotiation:** This round is crucial. With only 4 rounds left, I need to make a strong push to secure a deal before resorting to buying from John.

* **High Risk:** If I reject this offer and make a counteroffer, there's a risk that Alice will reject it, and I'll be left with only two rounds to secure a deal.
* **Guaranteed Price:**  Buying from John guarantees me the product at a price within my budget, even though it's not the most ideal outcome. 
* **Minimizing Loss:** By buying from John, I avoid potentially losing more time and money in further negotiations that might not result in a favorable outcome."
