"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. This item holds significant value to me, but I understand its worth to you is $8000. Considering this, I would like to offer it to you for $9500. This price reflects a thoughtful compromise between its value to me and its perceived value to you. I believe this is a fair offer that allows us both to benefit. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to proceed with the guaranteed purchase from John at a price that aligns with his budget."
