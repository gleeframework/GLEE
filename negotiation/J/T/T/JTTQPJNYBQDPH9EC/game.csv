"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let me know if this works for you.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you. However, $9,100 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,150?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",9150.0,Alice,5,
