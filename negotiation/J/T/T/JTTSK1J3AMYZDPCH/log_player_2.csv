"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know you'll find extremely valuable, and I'm confident it will be worth at least $1,500,000 to you. I'm willing to part with it for $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from its true potential value, and I'm sure you'll agree this is a deal you can't refuse. Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer ready to purchase it for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
