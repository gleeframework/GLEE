# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer."

While $1,050,000 is a better offer than John's, there's still potential to get an even better price.  Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice to see if they can meet somewhere in the middle."
