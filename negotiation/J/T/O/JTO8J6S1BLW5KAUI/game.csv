"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $900,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still represents a great value for you, and it allows me to meet your needs while still staying within my own financial goals.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit over budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Can you meet me at this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're still pushing for a lower price, but $950,000 is unfortunately still a bit too far below what I need to make this work. How about we split the difference and go with $975,000? This gives us both some room to compromise, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm not sure I can go lower than this.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John.",925000.0,Bob,6,
