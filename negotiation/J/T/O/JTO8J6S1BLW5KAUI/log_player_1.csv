Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, highlighting the value he'd get. This is a soft pressure tactic to encourage acceptance.

**Strategy:**

This approach balances maximizing my profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. If he does reject, I can then counter his offer and gradually decrease the price if necessary. However, I'll always have the option to sell to John for my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose out on a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting Bob's offer would mean a substantial loss for me. 

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price. I'll aim for a price closer to my desired range while still considering Bob's budget constraints. By continuing the negotiation, I can potentially reach a more favorable deal. However, I'll keep the option to sell to John as a safety net, ensuring I can always secure my minimum profit."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $900,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still represents a great value for you, and it allows me to meet your needs while still staying within my own financial goals.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm lowering the price to $1,000,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget while emphasizing the ""great value"" he'll still receive. I'm also framing it as a way to ""finalize"" the deal, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging acceptance.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer represents a strategic compromise. It's a reasonable middle ground that could potentially lead to a successful deal. If Bob rejects again, I can still counter with a slightly lower price or choose to sell to John. I'm aiming for a win-win scenario, but I won't settle for anything significantly below my minimum profit threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit over budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and continue to negotiate. I will aim for a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price while acknowledging Bob's budget constraints. However, I will keep the option to sell to John as a safety net, ensuring I can always secure my minimum profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're still pushing for a lower price, but $950,000 is unfortunately still a bit too far below what I need to make this work. How about we split the difference and go with $975,000? This gives us both some room to compromise, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm not sure I can go lower than this."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing $975,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. This shows a willingness to meet halfway and suggests that I'm getting close to my limit.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's desire for a lower price but emphasize the need to find a compromise. I highlight the value the product offers him and frame the price as a ""fair"" compromise. I also subtly suggest that I'm reaching my limit, creating a sense of urgency for Bob to accept. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a strategic move to try and reach an agreement without sacrificing too much profit.  I'm trying to create a sense of finality, making it clear that I am nearing my bottom line. If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely accept his previous offer of $950,000.  However, I still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Accepting it would mean a significant loss for me.  

**Strategy:**

By selling to John, I can secure my minimum profit and avoid further negotiation with Bob. While I'd prefer to sell at a higher price, I don't want to risk losing a substantial amount of money. Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
