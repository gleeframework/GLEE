"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to make this deal work. This price still reflects the value of the product to you, and it allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for everyone.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
