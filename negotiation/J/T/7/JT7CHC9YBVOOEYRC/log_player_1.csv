"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $50 because it is far too low. I can get $150 from John, so $50 isn't worth it. I will try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 
I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $175. This is still significantly higher than his offer, but it's a bit lower than my initial offer. I'm hoping that this will make it more appealing to Bob, while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $100. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below what I can get from John. I'm hoping I can get a higher offer from Bob in the next round, but I'm keeping John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $160. This is a bit lower than my previous offer, but still higher than what Bob offered. I'm hoping that this will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go much lower than this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $120.  While it's getting closer, it's still lower than what I can get from John. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I'm not going to give up on getting a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $155.  I'm getting a little nervous about running out of rounds, and John is always a backup option.  But I think $155 is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. We're running out of time, and while Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not enough to make it worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. I'm confident that John will be a reliable buyer, and I'm satisfied with the price."
