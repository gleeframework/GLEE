"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to me, and I'm confident it's a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is cutting it a bit close to my bottom line. I believe this product offers you a substantial return on your investment.  Would you consider $1,050,000? It splits the difference and represents a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to both of us.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
