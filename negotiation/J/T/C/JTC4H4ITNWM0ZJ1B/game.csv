"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love! It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $8,500 for the product, would you be willing to go that low?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to make a bit more for this product to make it worth my while.  How about $9,250? That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.  What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But I can't go any lower than $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value of this product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",9000.0,Alice,5,
