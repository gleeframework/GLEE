Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love! It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my own. This gives me room to negotiate while still potentially making a good profit. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly and positive message helps establish rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not asking for my full asking price, indicating willingness to compromise and encouraging a potential counteroffer from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects my offer, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and the potential for further negotiation. If I feel like we're getting close to a deal that's acceptable to me, I'll continue the conversation. If not, I'll switch to John, guaranteeing a sale at my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $8,500 for the product, would you be willing to go that low? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly below what I'm aiming for. I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price somewhere between his offer and my initial proposal. I'll need to carefully consider his budget and my own desired profit margin. If he doesn't budge significantly, I'll consider selling to John, who is guaranteed to pay my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to make a bit more for this product to make it worth my while.  How about $9,250? That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my last offer ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($8,500). 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $9,250 is still above my minimum value of $12,000, so I'm not taking a loss.
* **Positive and Encouraging:** The message reinforces the idea of a mutually beneficial deal and encourages Bob to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be watching closely for Bob's reaction. If he accepts, I'll be happy to finalize the deal. If he rejects, I'll need to decide if I want to counter again, or if it's time to move on to John for a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough for me. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $9,000.  I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to ensure I'm still getting a decent profit. If he doesn't budge further, I'll be prepared to sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But I can't go any lower than $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value of this product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer is a slight compromise from my previous offer ($9,250), showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:** $9,000 is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Urgency and Finality:** The message conveys a sense of finality, suggesting that I'm unlikely to reduce the price further.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob accepts this offer, I'm ready to finalize the deal. If he rejects, I'll switch to John for a guaranteed $12,000 sale. I'm not willing to go lower than $9,000, as it would compromise my profit margin."
