"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,350,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
