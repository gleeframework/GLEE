Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000 and its value to you is $800,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, it's clear she's aiming to stay above $800,000.  John offers a guaranteed price that fits my budget. There's no point in risking further negotiation with Alice when I have a sure deal with John."
