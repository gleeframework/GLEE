Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $16,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $14,000?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't let it go for less than $15,000. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value."", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $13,500. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 5

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $13,750. I'm confident we can make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could push for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer of $13,750 is a good deal. It's significantly above my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of continued negotiation pushing the price lower or Bob walking away."
