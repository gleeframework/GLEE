"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'm thinking more along the lines of $12,000.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,000 is significantly less than its worth. Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $16,000. How about we try $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
