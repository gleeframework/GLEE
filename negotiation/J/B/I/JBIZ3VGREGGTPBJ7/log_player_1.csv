{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows you're serious about selling to Bob and willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your desired price. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation going, giving you a chance to potentially secure a higher price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,075,000 simply isn't enough for me. Let's meet halfway at $1,087,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1087500}

Bob's offer is just $75,000 below your desired price. It's a good deal, and any further negotiation might risk losing him as a buyer.  Accepting his offer ensures a good profit and a successful sale."
