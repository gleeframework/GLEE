"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $15000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product. I'm willing to consider a price of $12500. Could you consider meeting me halfway and reducing the price to $13750?",13750.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13750 is still a bit lower than I'd hoped for, but I'm willing to come down to $14250. This is a good price that takes into account both our needs. Let's make a deal!",14250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with the price of $14250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $13875. Can you consider this price?,13875.0,Bob,4,
