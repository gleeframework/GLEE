Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. This is a time-sensitive offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still staying well above Alice's minimum.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" adds a bit of pressure for Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer, but the potential reward of securing a significantly higher price than John's offer makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
