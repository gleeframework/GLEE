"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but  $1,750,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 is significantly lower than the product's value. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which reflects a fair compromise. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
