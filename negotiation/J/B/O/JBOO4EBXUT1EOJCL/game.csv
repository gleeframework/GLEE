"Bob, I have a product that I believe is of great value to you.  I understand it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its worth.  However, I'm also confident in its value and I'm looking for a fair return on my investment.  I'm offering you the product for $1,050,000. This price reflects a reasonable profit for me, while still giving you a fair deal.  Consider this a chance to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price.  Let me know your decision.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
