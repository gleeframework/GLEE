"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After considering your potential interest, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a competitive price that still reflects the value you'll receive from this product.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but  $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. While $600,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'd like to counteroffer at $900,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise given our previous discussions.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Could you do $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $850,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise given our previous discussions.",850000.0,Alice,5,
