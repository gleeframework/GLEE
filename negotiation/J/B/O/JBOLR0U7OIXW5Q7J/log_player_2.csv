"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $950,000 is still too high, and there are 9 more rounds to negotiate.  It's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product looks great, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much as possible. While $925,000 is better than the initial offer, it's still too high. There are still plenty of rounds to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $925,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit while still giving me a good deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is my final offer for now, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better price than previous offers, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. With 5 rounds remaining, there's still room to negotiate a lower price. It's worth pushing to get closer to the $850,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a little too high. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's halfway between our last two offers. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000 was a compromise, but I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. I'm counteroffering at $912,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price, and $912,500 is still a bit too high.  With only 3 rounds left, it's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if Alice will budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $912,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $890,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your value while keeping the deal within my budget.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 890000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $907,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm hoping we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $907,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $907,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the last round before Bob has to buy from John. While $907,500 is better than previous offers, Bob can still try to push for a lower price. There's a chance Alice will accept a slightly lower offer to avoid losing the deal. If not, buying from John is still better than accepting this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer.  I'm willing to go up to $895,000 for your product. It's a fair price, and I believe it's the best deal we can both get.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 895000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round, so Bob needs to make a decision.  He's pushing for a slightly lower price than his previous offer, hoping to secure a deal before having to buy from John.  If Alice rejects, Bob will have to buy from John at $1,000,000, so there's not much to lose by attempting one more counteroffer."
