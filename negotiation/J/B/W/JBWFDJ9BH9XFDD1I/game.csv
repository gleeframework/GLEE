"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $800000 for this product. Would it be possible to negotiate a price closer to that amount?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $800000 is significantly below what this product is worth to me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900000? This still offers you a good deal, and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand the value of the product to you, I would like to propose a price of $850000. This still allows me to stay within my budget while providing you with a reasonable profit.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $850000 is still too far below my minimum.  Let's split the difference -  $875000. This gives you a good price and allows me to move closer to my desired value.",875000.0,Alice,5,
