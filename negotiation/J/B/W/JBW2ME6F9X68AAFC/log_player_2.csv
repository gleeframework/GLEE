"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get as close to his maximum budget as possible. He's going for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, hoping to spark a negotiation.  This will test Alice's willingness to compromise and see if she's close to her minimum selling price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still slightly above it.  There's still room for negotiation, especially since Alice rejected Bob's counteroffer.  Bob can likely get the price down further by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now proposing his maximum price. He's aiming to close the deal without going over his budget. This is a strategic move, as if Alice accepts, Bob gets the product at his target price. If Alice rejects, Bob knows his limit and can decide whether to move to John or continue negotiating."
