"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  Let's meet in the middle.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $92. Can you meet me at that price?",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $92 is closer, I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and settle on $96? It's a fair price for both of us.",96.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not sure I can go as high as $96, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we do $94? That's the highest I'm comfortable going.",94.0,Bob,6,
