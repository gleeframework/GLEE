"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60.",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but $60 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $90.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle on $75? That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $75 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $95?",95.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're not making much progress here.  I'm willing to go up to $78, but that's my absolute limit.",78.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $78 is still a bit short for me. I'm willing to meet you at $85, but that's as low as I can go.",85.0,Alice,7,
