Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

**Goal:** This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit. The worst-case scenario is Bob rejects the offer, and you sell to John at your desired minimum."
