"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love! I'm willing to let it go for $11,000, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good price, it's still above his $10,000 limit. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. If that fails, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it.  While I love the product, $11,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,500? That's the highest I can go right now."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget.  $10,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,750? That's a fair price considering the value of the product and it gives you some room to work with. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,750 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Since Bob can get the product for $10,000 from John, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice. Buying from John is the most cost-effective option."
