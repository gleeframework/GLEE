{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a significant price reduction, considering its value to me. I'm confident you'll find this a fair offer, given the potential it holds for your business.  Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can find a compromise, but I'm not going to accept a price that undervalues my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  How about we split the difference?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we settle on $1250000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $1,500,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm not going to accept anything less than $1,350,000 at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy we're making progress.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1275000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to risk losing a better deal with John.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price, so it's the best course of action at this point."
