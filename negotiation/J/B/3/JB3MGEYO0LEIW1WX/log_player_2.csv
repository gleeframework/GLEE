"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to us and we believe it could be valuable to you as well. Would you like to purchase it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
```
Reason: Alice's starting offer is her maximum value. We have plenty of room to negotiate a lower price.
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for presenting your product. While I believe it could be useful, the price point is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

Reason: We start with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price but one that still allows for  negotiation and keeps us far from our maximum budget. This allows us to gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your interest in the product, I am willing to negotiate. How about offering the product at $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

```
Reason: While Alice has come down significantly, $95 is still a considerable distance from our ideal price and even further from our starting offer.  We will continue to negotiate. 
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $95 is still a bit steep for me. Could you consider something closer to $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

Reason: We are strategically moving closer to our maximum budget but leaving room for further negotiation. By suggesting $70, we aim to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to both parties."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

```
Reason: Alice has met our maximum budget. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or going to John, as we've achieved the best possible price.
