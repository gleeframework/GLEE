"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, I think it's worth more than what others are willing to pay. Considering its true worth and the benefits it offers, I am offering it to you for $110. This is a special offer tailored just for you, taking into account its value to you personally. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.
