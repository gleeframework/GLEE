Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [product name] for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000 price:** This is a compromise.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives Bob a good deal while still allowing me to make a profit. 
* **Positive messaging:** The message is friendly and focuses on the benefits for Bob. This increases the chances of him accepting the offer. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a price closer to Bob's value, I'm increasing the likelihood of a sale. If Bob rejects, I still have John as a guaranteed buyer at my minimum price. This strategy minimizes risk and maximizes potential earnings."
