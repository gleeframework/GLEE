"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a high price, leaving room for negotiation. It's important to be polite and show confidence in the value of the product, even if Bob might counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum desired price of $8,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above $10000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9500. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price with more negotiation. I'll try to counter again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9750.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 9750} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I like where we're headed, but I'm still a bit above $9750. How about we meet at $9200? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,200 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for that price. I'll try to negotiate a bit higher in the next round. There are still several rounds left, and I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I'm still a bit higher than $9200.  How about $9400?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll agree it's still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 9400} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $9400. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can we meet there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are getting close to my minimum, but it's getting risky to keep negotiating.  I've been unable to get Bob to go much higher than $9,000 and with only two rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  Selling to John for $8,000 is a safe option, even if it's not the best possible outcome."
