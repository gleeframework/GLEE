"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. I understand it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm asking for $900,000. This gives you a substantial saving over the value you've assigned, and allows me to gain a significant portion of the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
