"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8500 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9000? It's still a good price for you and allows me to make a fair profit.",9000.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $8800? I think that's a good compromise.,8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8800 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9250. This price is a good compromise and reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8750. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower.",8750.0,Bob,6,
