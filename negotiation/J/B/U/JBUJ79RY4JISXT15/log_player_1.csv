Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $14,000 is higher than your minimum of $12,000, so you're already making a profit. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so there's a $1,000 gap for potential compromise. 
* **It shows you're serious:** By offering a specific price, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response.  Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, falling below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  That's still a great deal for you considering its value, and it's closer to my minimum."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  While $12,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $11,500. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $11,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I'm confident that I can get at least $12,000 from John, so I'll sell the product to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
