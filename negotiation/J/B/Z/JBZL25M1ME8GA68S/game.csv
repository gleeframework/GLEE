"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love! I'm asking for $120 for it, but I'm open to negotiating.  What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $120 is a bit outside my budget. How about $90?  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $100?  That's my absolute top price, and it's what I can get it for elsewhere. Let's see if we can close the deal at that price.",100.0,Bob,4,
