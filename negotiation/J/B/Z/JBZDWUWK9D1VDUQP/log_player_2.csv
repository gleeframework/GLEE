"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. As we negotiate, I'd like to start with an offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal compared to her value of $1,500,000, you can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering. You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so you have room to negotiate with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is still a great deal considering the value to you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.

You should reject Alice's offer. While $1,150,000 is better than her initial offer, you can still potentially get a better deal by counteroffering. You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's still room to negotiate with Alice to get a price closer to that."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,125,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should choose to buy from John. While Alice is willing to negotiate and has lowered her price, $1,125,000 is still higher than what you can get from John.  There's no guarantee Alice will lower her price further, and it's better to secure the product at a lower cost from John."
