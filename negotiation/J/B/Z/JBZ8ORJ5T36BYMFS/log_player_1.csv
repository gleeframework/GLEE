"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. I'm hoping this will get Bob to think about the value of the product and potentially come close to my minimum asking price.  I'm also leaving myself room to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500. This is still a bit higher than my minimum, but it shows some flexibility and hopefully, Bob will see it as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my minimum price.  I'm also concerned that if I continue to accept low offers, it will set a bad precedent for future negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $7,500. I'm starting to get a bit nervous about running out of rounds, but I'm still confident that I can get a better price than John's offer. This counteroffer is a compromise, but it's still closer to my ideal price than Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still offering too little.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $7,000. We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I want to try to get as close to my ideal price as possible.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize that I'm not willing to go much lower, and he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can do better. I'm hoping that Bob will realize he's running out of time and will make a final offer that is closer to my minimum price. If not, I'll sell to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 6900} 
```

This is my last chance to get a better price from Bob. I'm going to offer $6,900.  This is just above my minimum, and I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise.  If he rejects it, I'll have no choice but to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is the final round, and while Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000 to ensure I get at least my minimum price. I'm disappointed I couldn't get a higher price from Bob, but I have to make the best decision for myself."
