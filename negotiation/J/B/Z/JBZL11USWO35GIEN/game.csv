"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm hoping to find a price that's even more appealing. I'm willing to pay $700000 for this product. I believe this reflects its value fairly, and it allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $700000 is a bit below my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $820000. This is a compromise that I think still reflects the product's value, and I'm open to further discussions.",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $820000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $750000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product, and it's the final offer I'm prepared to make. ",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $750000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $790000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",790000.0,Alice,5,
