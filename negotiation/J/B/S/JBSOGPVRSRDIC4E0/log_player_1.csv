Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $120, which is a significant amount above my minimum ($80) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm focusing on the value the product brings to Bob and not just stating the price. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm ending the message with a question to encourage Bob to respond and potentially counteroffer.

This strategy balances the desire to get a good price with the need to keep the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my target:**  While $100 is better than John's offer of $80, it's still below my desired price point. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by countering Bob's offer. 
* **Keeping options open:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation, potentially reaching a more favorable price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and can explore if a higher price is achievable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see your point.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $110? I'm confident this product will be worth it for you."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility.  
* **Maintain my profit margin:**  $110 is still above my minimum price, ensuring a profit for me. 
* **Reiterate the product's value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, suggesting it's a good deal at this price. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still securing a profitable sale."
