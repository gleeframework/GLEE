You have three options:

The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is asking for $120. You can likely get a better price, so it's worth negotiating."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see your point.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $110? I'm confident this product will be worth it for you.

Alice has come down to $110, which is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $150 to you.  It's worth accepting this offer before the price goes up again."
