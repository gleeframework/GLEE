"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  A $500 buffer allows for negotiation without dropping below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer will gauge Bob's interest and provide information for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Than Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point through further negotiation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John would guarantee $8,000, but the potential for a higher price with Bob outweighs the risk of a failed negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my offer from $9,500 to $9,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still protecting my profit margin.
* **Motivating Bob:** This offer shows Bob that I'm serious about selling but also that I'm not desperate to accept his low offer.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  It keeps the negotiation moving towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Improvement:** Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my desired price point. 
* **Increasing Stakes:**  The fact that Bob is increasing his offer suggests he's motivated to buy.  I want to see if I can push him further.
* **Balancing Risk:**  While selling to John would be a safe option, there's still a good chance I can get closer to my goal price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:**  This is a slight reduction from my previous offer, showing flexibility. 
* **Testing the Limit:**  This offer is close to Bob's last offer, and I'm gauging his maximum willingness to pay.
* **Time Pressure:**  The negotiation is moving along, and with 5 rounds remaining, I need to start closing the gap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Goal:**  Bob's offer is only $100 away from my minimum acceptable price of $8,700.
* **Limited Time:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation with only 4 rounds remaining.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob will become less willing to negotiate or even walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $8,000.

It's better to secure a deal close to my desired price point than to risk getting stuck with a lower offer or losing the deal altogether."
