Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $13,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point."", 
""product_price"": 13500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  I'm beginning the negotiation significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""significant value,"" I'm subtly anchoring the price in Bob's mind without explicitly stating why it's worth that much to him. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I'm aiming high, I need to be mindful that pushing Bob too hard might make him walk away. The gap between my initial offer and John's offer allows for some back and forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $11,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is Engaged:** Bob's counteroffer is a positive sign.  He's clearly interested and willing to negotiate within a reasonable range.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While his offer is below my ideal price, it's still significantly above my minimum ($11,000 vs. $10,000). There's space for a counteroffer.
* **John as Leverage:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale with John gives me a strong position. I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you recognizing the value.  While I'm aiming for a price closer to $13,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,000?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession & Compromise:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and signal flexibility by making a significant move from my initial price.
* **Middle Ground:** The $12,000 offer represents a compromise, splitting the difference between his counteroffer and my previous asking price. 
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's worth to me while showing a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $11,500 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob is clearly interested and has incrementally increased his offer. This shows his commitment to the deal.
* **Profitable Deal:** $11,500 is a good price, exceeding my minimum requirement and providing a solid profit. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting now secures a favorable outcome."
