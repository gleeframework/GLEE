"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, your price is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, which reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While that number doesn't work for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer reflects the true value and potential of this product, which I'm confident will exceed your expectations.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still outside my price range. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This represents a fair price for both of us. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll unfortunately have to look elsewhere.",850000.0,Bob,4,
