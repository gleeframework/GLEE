Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, your price is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, which reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While that number doesn't work for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still outside my price range. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This represents a fair price for both of us. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll unfortunately have to look elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Bob is holding firm at a price far below the product's value to me.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap. Accepting John's offer ensures I receive the full value I need."
