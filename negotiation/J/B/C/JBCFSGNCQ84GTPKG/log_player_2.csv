"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still leaves a significant profit margin for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is a better price than buying from John for $1,500,000.  While there's still room for negotiation, it's likely that Alice won't go much lower.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price."
