Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly beneficial. I'm asking for $1,400,000. Let me know what you think, I'm open to discussing further."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,400,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), giving Alice room to negotiate while still aiming for a substantial profit.
* **Open Communication:** The message encourages dialogue. Bob might counter-offer, and a negotiation could lead to a mutually beneficial price.  

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice is willing to risk losing the guaranteed sale to John for a chance to earn more from Bob."
