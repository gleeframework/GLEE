I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, giving Bob room to negotiate.  It also allows me to gauge his interest and potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better price from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm coming down to $17,500. This is still significantly above my minimum and gives Bob room to negotiate, but also shows I'm serious about selling to him."
