"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $9,500? I'm confident this product will be worth it for you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. Can you consider that?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a little below what I'm looking for.  How about we settle on $9,400?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be very happy with the product.",9400.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your persistence, but $9,400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,300, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",9300.0,Bob,6,
