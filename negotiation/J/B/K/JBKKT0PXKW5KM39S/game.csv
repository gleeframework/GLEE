,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  That seems like a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm getting close to the price I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $112? I'm willing to pay that price for the product.,112.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $112.  How about we try $113?  That's a small step closer to my asking price.",113.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $113. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $111? I'm willing to pay that price for the product.",111.0,Bob,6,
