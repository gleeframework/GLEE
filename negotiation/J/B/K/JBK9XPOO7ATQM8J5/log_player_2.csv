Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  That's a significant discount from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go below her product's value of $12,000 to her. You've already managed to get her down by $4,000, and she's holding firm.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $10,000, it makes the most financial sense to take that deal and save the extra $2,000."
