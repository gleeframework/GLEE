"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. Let me know what you think!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $8,500?  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $7,000. However, I need to be closer to $10,000 to make this work for me. Would you be willing to go to $9,000? It's still a significant saving compared to John's price, and it allows me to keep this deal going. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $9,000. It's better to secure the product from John at $8,000 and avoid further negotiation."
