,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $140? I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get at least close to my asking price.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice. I can go a little higher, but $140 is still a bit much for me. How about $125?",125.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to see you're coming up in your offer.  $125 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",135.0,Alice,5,
