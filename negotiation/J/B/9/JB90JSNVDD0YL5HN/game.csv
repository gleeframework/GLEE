"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking to make a profit, but I'm on a tight budget. How about $925,000? That's a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $925,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about the value this product will bring to you. How about we meet at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $1,025,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to you.",1025000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're feeling frustrated, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up on getting a good price for this product. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to think about the long-term value of this deal. How about we meet at $1,050,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
