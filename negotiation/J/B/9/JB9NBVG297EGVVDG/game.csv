"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $11500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $10500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering $10750. This would be a fair compromise for both of us and allow us to move forward with the sale.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I still need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering the product to you for $11200. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",11200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to reach a certain price, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $11200 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm offering $10900 as my final counteroffer.  This price reflects the value of the product to me while also giving you a fair deal.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this price.",10900.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $10900. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to reach a mutually beneficial price.
