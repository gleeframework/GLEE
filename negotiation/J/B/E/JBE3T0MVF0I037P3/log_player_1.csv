Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start negotiations higher with Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" without explicitly revealing your bottom line. 
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit. If Bob accepts, you earn a significant surplus. If he rejects it, you still have John as a reliable backup."
