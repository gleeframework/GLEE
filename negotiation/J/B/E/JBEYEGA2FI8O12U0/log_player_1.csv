"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can get a higher price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,500. This price still gives you a great value, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $16500 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $14500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's counteroffer is still a bit too low for me. Considering John is willing to pay my minimum price, I'll sell the product to him and avoid further negotiation."
