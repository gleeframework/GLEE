"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $100 for it. Would you consider this offer?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $100 doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $110? It's still a fair price for a product worth $100 to you, and it gives me a bit of a profit. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I'm still looking for a deal within my price range. Could you perhaps lower the price to $95? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise. While $95 is tempting, it's still below my minimum price.  Let's try $105. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm still hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Could you consider $100 as a final offer? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",100.0,Bob,6,
