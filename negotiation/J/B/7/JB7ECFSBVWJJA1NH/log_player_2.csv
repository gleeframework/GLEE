"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can likely get a better deal than $120. Since you are willing to pay up to $150, rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate, but $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 was a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer of $100, I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $110. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has come down to $110, which is a good price for you. It's a reasonable compromise and saves you $40 compared to buying from John."
