Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, leveraging the information you've provided:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts â€“ this offer stands for the next 24 hours."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you know the product's value to Bob ($800,000) and your minimum acceptable price ($800,000), starting high allows room for negotiation.
* **Value Justification:**  Instead of just stating a price, the message hints at the product's value (""exceed your expectations""), subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Urgency:** The 24-hour limit encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially reduces his inclination to negotiate down significantly.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't be forced to go below your minimum price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes Bob is potentially open to a higher price if he perceives significant value. If you have insights into his negotiation style, you might adjust your approach.
* **Market Information:** While you have John as a backup, knowing the broader market demand and potential alternative buyers could influence your strategy."
