"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This represents a significant savings for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another interested party ready to purchase at a lower price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
