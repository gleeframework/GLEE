Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the information you've provided:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Secure the Sale:** While you have a backup buyer, it's generally best to secure the sale quickly. Offering a price that's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value increases your chances of acceptance.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher to leave more room for concessions.
* **Market Information:** If you have reason to believe there might be other buyers willing to pay more than John's $1,000,000, you could adjust your offer accordingly."
