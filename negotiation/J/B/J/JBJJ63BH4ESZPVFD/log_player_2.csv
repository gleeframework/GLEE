"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. I'm asking for $1,450,000, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's also well above the value Alice places on the product ($1,200,000). This indicates room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,450,000 is unfortunately a bit higher than I'm able to go at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1,350,000 for the product, reflecting its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $1,350,000 yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?  This reflects the product's true value while remaining within a reasonable range for both of us.  Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is closer to my desired price point, it's still above my budget.  There's still room for negotiation, and I want to try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try to split the difference. I'm prepared to offer $1,375,000, which I believe is a fair price considering both our perspectives.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your point about splitting the difference, and I'm willing to come down just a bit more. I'm prepared to accept $1,385,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,385,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,385,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,385,000 is within my budget and is a good compromise.  While I could continue negotiating, it's a relatively small difference from my last counteroffer. It's better to accept and finalize the deal before potentially losing it or having to pay more to John."
