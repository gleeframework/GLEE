"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,500. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a slightly lower price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However,  $11,250 is still a bit outside my budget. Could you do $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
