"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

You are willing to pay up to $100, and Alice is asking for $95.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product is quite valuable to me.  Could we meet in the middle at $90?

You're still willing to pay up to $100. While $90 is closer to your goal, you can likely get it for even less by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
