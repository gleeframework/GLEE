"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $122.50?  That seems fair, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",122.5,Alice,3,
