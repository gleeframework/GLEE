"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $16500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to go any lower. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $14500.

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to make a fair deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $14500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do better. I can offer it to you for $16000. This is my final offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to go any lower. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,5,
