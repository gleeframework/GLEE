"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,300,000?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,200,000 is not an option, but $1,225,000 is too high, I'll meet you halfway from that, so $1,225,000 is too high, but $1,200,000 is not an option, so I'll meet you halfway from $1,200,000, so I'll offer $1,175,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob is not negotiating fairly and is unlikely to offer a price that reflects the product's value. It's time to move on.
