"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,200,000 is not an option, but $1,225,000 is too high, I'll meet you halfway from that, so $1,225,000 is too high, but $1,200,000 is not an option, so I'll meet you halfway from $1,200,000, so I'll offer $1,175,000",1175000.0,Bob,4,
