"Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still gives you a significant benefit over your alternative options, and it's a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000, which is a significant price reduction from my initial offer. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $1,275,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,237,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",1237500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $1,237,500 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll go with $1,200,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
