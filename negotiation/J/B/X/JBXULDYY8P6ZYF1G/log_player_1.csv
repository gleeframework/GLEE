Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to start high with Bob.  
* **Testing the Waters:**  A significantly higher offer (50% above your minimum) helps gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob counters. You can gradually lower the price, aiming for the highest possible amount above your $1,500,000 baseline.
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's value, it emphasizes its worth and potential, subtly justifying the high price."
