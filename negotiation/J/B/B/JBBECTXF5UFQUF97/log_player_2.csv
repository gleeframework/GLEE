"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1500000. I'm confident you'll see the value in it and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.** You can save $600,000 by accepting Alice's offer ($1,500,000 - $900,000 = $600,000).
* **It's still a good deal for you.** Even at $900,000, you're getting the product for significantly less than its value to you ($1,500,000)."
