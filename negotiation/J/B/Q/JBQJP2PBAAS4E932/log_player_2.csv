"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better deal than John's offer, it's still above your target price of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. After reconsidering the value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is within your budget and is a good deal considering John's offer of $800,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll end up paying the same amount with John. It's more strategic to accept Alice's offer and secure the product."
