Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer sets a price that is higher than John's offer, leaving room for potential negotiation with Bob. If Bob rejects, you can still sell to John and ensure at least $8,000. However, it leaves open the possibility of getting a higher price from Bob if he values the product more."
