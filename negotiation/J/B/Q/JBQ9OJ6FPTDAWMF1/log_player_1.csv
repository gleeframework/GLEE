"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get as close to Bob's perceived value as possible while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $140 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $130. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I'm still hoping for a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $130 is just too low for me. How about $135? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
