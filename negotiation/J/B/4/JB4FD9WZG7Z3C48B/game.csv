"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't exceed $8,000 for it. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand the value of the product, I still believe it should not exceed $8,000. Could we perhaps aim for a price closer to my initial suggestion?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the price you're suggesting is still significantly below the product's worth. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is my final offer, as I already have another buyer interested at this price.",15000.0,Alice,5,
