"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high with $1,000,000. It's a bold move, but I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play in this price range.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $750,000 is a decent amount, I'm holding out for a better price.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I still believe I can get closer to my ideal price with Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm countering with $900,000.  This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm showing flexibility, but I'm not giving away too much.  I'm hoping this price will be attractive to Bob, but still allow me to earn more than I would selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is dropping his offer significantly. While I'm starting to feel the pressure, I'm not ready to give up just yet.  $675,000 is too low for me. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value, but still lower than my last offer.  I'll see if this will bring Bob closer to my range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm countering with $850,000.  This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable value of $800,000.  I believe this price is fair, considering the decreasing offers from Bob.  I'm hoping this will be the price that brings us to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is getting frustrating. Bob's offer is way too low, and I'm running out of time.  I've reached my limit in terms of lowering my price, and I don't think I can get a better offer from Bob.  It's time to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
