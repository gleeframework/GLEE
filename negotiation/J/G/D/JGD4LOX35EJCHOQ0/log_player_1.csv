"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,000,000, but it allows room for negotiation. It also sets a strong starting point and signals that I am confident in the value of the product. 

I'm not starting at a price too close to my minimum as this could make me seem desperate, and it could also lead to Bob lowballing me. 

I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 at any point. This gives me a safety net and helps me avoid settling for a price I'm not comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer would be a loss for me. While I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, I'm going to try to negotiate with Bob further. There's a chance we can find a price that's acceptable to both of us. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm not desperate for a sale and that I believe the product is worth more. This could lead to a more favorable outcome in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer of $1,500,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. However, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 

This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm serious about selling to him, but I also have a strong stance on the value of the product. 

By narrowing the gap between our positions, I aim to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  It's a good deal for me, considering I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000.  

While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, leaving me with only the option to sell to John.  Accepting this offer ensures a profit for me, and I believe it's a good compromise considering the limited rounds we have left."
