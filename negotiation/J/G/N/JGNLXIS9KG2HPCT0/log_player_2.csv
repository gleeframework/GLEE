"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $150, but I'm willing to part with it for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $100 and even higher than John's guaranteed price of $100. 
* While Alice tries to frame the offer as a deal, you have no reason to believe the product is worth more than John's offer.
* By rejecting this offer, you can move forward with buying from John at a price that fits your budget."
