"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's a price that works for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as close to $8,000 as possible.  $12,000 is too high, so it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider an offer of $9,000? "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price reflects the product's value and still allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can make this work.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's target price of $8,000, it's still too high.  Bob should continue to negotiate for a better price. There are still several rounds left, and he can always buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit outside my range. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need to stay closer to $10,000 to make this work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's get this deal done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price, but $10,000 is still too high. There are still rounds left, and he can always buy from John if he needs to.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to offer $9,750, which is a very reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close. I'm willing to come down to $9,850. It's a small step, but it shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $9,850, which is very close to Bob's target price of $8,000.  It's only $850 above his ideal price.  Considering the negotiation has progressed well, and there are only a few rounds left, accepting the offer is a good strategy."
