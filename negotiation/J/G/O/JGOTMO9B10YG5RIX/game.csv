"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a little high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $750,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $850,000? This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I see the value in the product, $850,000 is still a bit above what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to consider $800,000?  I feel that's a fair offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $800,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go much lower than that. I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. How about we try $825,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
