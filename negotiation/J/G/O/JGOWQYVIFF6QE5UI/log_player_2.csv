"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial value of $10,000, Bob can likely do better.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter-offer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate it,  $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer, closer to his maximum value of $8,000.  This sets the stage for negotiation, hoping to get Alice to lower her price while still leaving room for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $8,500 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I'm confident this product will be well worth the investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is better than Alice's previous offer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $8,750? This is a fair price that respects both of our needs."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making another counteroffer, this time slightly higher than his initial offer but still lower than Alice's latest proposal.  This shows he's willing to compromise while staying within his budget. By offering a price ending in .50, Bob subtly suggests a willingness to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $8,750 is still a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his budget with Alice's offer of $8,900. However, he's only $100 away from his target price of $8,800.  He's likely to be able to get a slightly better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget with your offer. However, $8,900 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  Let's split the difference and finalize the deal at $8,800. This price will allow us both to walk away happy with the agreement."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final counteroffer,  splitting the difference between his desired price of $8,800 and Alice's offer of $8,900. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and reach a mutually agreeable price.  If Alice accepts, Bob gets the product for $100 less than her offer, while still meeting his budget constraints."
