"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1600000. Can you consider this price?",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $1600000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I'm still looking for something closer to my initial asking price. How about $1800000? Let's find a price that works for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a price closer to your initial asking price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1700000. Can you consider this price?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1700000 is getting closer to where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $1750000? I'm confident this price is still a great deal for you, considering the value of this product.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $1750000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1725000. Can you consider this price?,1725000.0,Bob,6,
