Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $9,500 is higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's significantly less than your minimum value of $10,000, giving you room to make concessions if needed.
* **It sets a clear expectation:**  By stating the price upfront, you avoid a lengthy back-and-forth.

If Bob rejects this offer, you can adjust your price slightly lower in subsequent counteroffers, but always keeping in mind that you can walk away and sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob, or sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, I'm not able to go that low.  $9,000 is my final offer, and it reflects the true value of this product.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure I can go up to $9,000. Can you meet me at $8,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,800 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still not ideal. I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target of $9,500. If Bob rejects again, I'll sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but $8,800 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,900?  That's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think $8,900 is a bit too high. Can you meet me at $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a price close to my minimum value of $10,000. While $8,750 is a decent offer, it's still significantly less than what I'm hoping for.  Therefore, I will sell the product to John for $10,000, ensuring I meet my minimum price target."
