"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for my budget.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but $800,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and its potential for your business.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer on the price. However,  $1,800,000 is still a big stretch for me.  To be frank, I'm considering other options. If you're able to come down to $1,100,000, I think we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to make this work for both of us.  Let's compromise:  I can come down to $1,550,000. This is a final offer, reflecting the absolute lowest price I can offer for this valuable product. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for your business.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However,  $1,550,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $1,325,000. This is a strong offer, and I need you to understand I'm getting close to pursuing other options.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
