"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget constraints, I'm willing to offer $750,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value I'd get from the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

This price aligns with my financial limitations and represents a fair value for the product. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement at this price, allowing both of us to benefit from this transaction. ",800000.0,Bob,4,
