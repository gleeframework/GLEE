Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob before going to John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested, but still ensures a profit for you.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding ""limited time"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly. 

**Important Note:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, you're still guaranteed to sell the product for your minimum acceptable price to John."
