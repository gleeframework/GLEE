"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still ensuring I get significantly more than my minimum price.  It's important to see if Bob is even interested in paying this much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000.  I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,500. This is still a significant profit for me, and it's a reasonable compromise, especially considering Bob's low offer.  I'm hoping he'll see the value in my product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable selling below my minimum price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but if he keeps refusing, I'll be forced to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to counter with $16,000.  This is my last offer before I consider selling to John.  I'm hoping Bob recognizes the value of the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum price, but I've already been through five rounds of negotiation and I'm starting to run out of time.  Rather than risk another rejection and potentially lower offer, I'm going to sell to John.  I'm guaranteed $15,000 and I don't have to waste any more time."
