I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. It's a good starting point for negotiation, and it allows me to gauge his interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to him while still ensuring I get a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to risk going too low and losing out on a better deal. John is offering a guaranteed price of $1,200,000, which is above my minimum and secures a safe sale. I will sell the product to John."
