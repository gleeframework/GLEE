"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects its true value and benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We want to anchor the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000).  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""potential"" and ""benefits"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth to him.
* **Positive Tone:** A collaborative tone encourages a deal rather than an adversarial standoff. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while gauging Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good profit, we're still significantly below Bob's perceived value. Rejecting now allows us to:

* **Test his resolve:** See if he's willing to move closer to our initial offer.
* **Maintain a strong position:**  Prematurely accepting might signal we're willing to go much lower. 

We'll counter in the next round, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand budget considerations.  To find a middle ground, I propose $1,025,000.  This reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your initial offer."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We've come down $75,000, showing flexibility but not desperation.
* **Anchoring to Our Price:**  By staying closer to our initial offer, we're aiming for a higher final price.
* **Justification:** We're still emphasizing the product's value to justify the higher price.

This round will test if Bob is willing to move significantly from his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I've considered your offer and would like to counter with $975,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer by $25,000, signaling some flexibility but still demonstrating he's aiming for a price closer to his initial offer.  While $975,000 is tempting, we're still in early rounds. We have room to negotiate, especially knowing the product's value to him. 

We'll reject and counter, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000, which represents a strong profit while acknowledging his concessions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,010,000.  I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the product's unique value and our mutual desire to reach an agreement."",
""product_price"": 1010000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** A decrease of $15,000 signals we're nearing our desired price point, but still open to a deal.
* **Focus on Fairness and Agreement:** This framing emphasizes finding common ground rather than just numbers.
* **No Ultimatums:** We avoid language like ""final offer"" to keep the negotiation open and less pressured.

This round aims to encourage Bob to meet us closer to our target while avoiding a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'd like to counter with $990,000. Let's see if we can reach a fair agreement within our respective budgets. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $990,000 is a significant profit margin, well above our minimum and close to our target price.
* **Negotiation Pattern:**  Bob has consistently increased his offer in smaller increments, suggesting he might not go much higher.
* **Time Value:** We're past the halfway point in the negotiation.  Continuing carries the risk of Bob walking away or stalling until we're forced to accept a lower offer or sell to John.

While we might be able to squeeze out a little more, the risk outweighs the potential reward. Accepting at $990,000 secures a very favorable outcome."
