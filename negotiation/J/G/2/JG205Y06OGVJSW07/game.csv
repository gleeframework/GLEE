"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,000,000 is above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal considering the potential value this product holds.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
