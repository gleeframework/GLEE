# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,000,000 is above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time. Let me know what you think.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.

While Bob is moving closer to my valuation, it's not happening quickly enough. I'd rather take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than risk further negotiation with Bob."
