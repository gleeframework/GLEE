# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is far too high. It's above your maximum budget, and you can get a better deal elsewhere.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a price you're comfortable with."

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above your maximum budget.  Rejecting her offer allows you to continue negotiating and try to push for a price closer to your desired range."
