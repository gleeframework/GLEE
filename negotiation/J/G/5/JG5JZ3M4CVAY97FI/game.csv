"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let's see if we can work something out.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which is a fair price for both of us.  If you're willing to accept this offer, we can finalize the deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and $13,000, which would be $12,250. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,250 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still a bit over budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11,750, which is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. ",11750.0,Bob,6,
