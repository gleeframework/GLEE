{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a great starting point, but it's likely she can go lower.  There's no reason to accept it on the first round.  We'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to show Alice I'm serious about getting a good price.  This is a substantial drop from her initial offer, but it's still within my budget and leaves room for negotiation."

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

Alice moved closer to my original counteroffer. I'm going to meet her halfway with a slightly higher offer, but still significantly lower than her initial price.  I believe this demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining my goal of getting a good deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still not satisfied. The price is within my budget, but there's room for a better deal. I'll try to negotiate further and see if I can squeeze out a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to a deal. Alice's last offer was just a bit too high.  My counteroffer is a compromise that meets her halfway and is close to my target price. I'm hoping she'll accept it and we can finalize the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to the end of the negotiations, and while Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price, it's within my budget and the difference is small enough that it's not worth risking the deal. It's likely that Alice won't come down further, and I'm worried that if I reject, she might be even more resistant in the next round.  This offer is a good compromise and allows me to secure the product at a reasonable price."
