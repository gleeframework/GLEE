"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll be very interested in.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to sell, $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $11,000 is the lowest I can go.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one.  How about $10,750?  It's a good price for both of us, and I think it's fair.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $10,750 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit lower.  How about $10,600?  This is really my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",10600.0,Bob,6,
