"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm sure you'll find it's worth every penny.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I think it's a bit high considering the product's value. Can we meet in the middle at $13500?",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product's value is worth a bit more. How about we compromise at $14000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $14000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $13500 again. However, I'm willing to go a bit lower, so my final offer is $13200. Can we agree on that price?",13200.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're willing to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $13200. I think the product's value is worth a bit more, especially considering its unique features. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to sell it to you for $13700?",13700.0,Alice,5,
