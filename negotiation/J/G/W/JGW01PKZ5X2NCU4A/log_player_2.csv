"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the value it can bring to your life. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, so there's no immediate benefit to accepting. It's worth exploring if you can get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $12,000 is right at my budget limit. I'm happy to consider it if you're willing to come down a bit. I'm comfortable paying $10,000 for it, and I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident in the value this product can bring. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the benefits you'll receive from owning this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,000, which is a good compromise. While I'd prefer to pay less, it's still within my budget and a better deal than buying from John for $12,000. There's a chance I could negotiate further, but the risk of Alice rejecting and having to buy from John makes accepting her offer the most sensible choice."
