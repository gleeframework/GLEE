(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget of $8,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
