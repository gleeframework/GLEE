Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering what it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:**  While Bob may counter-offer, framing the price with the product's value emphasizes why it's worth considering even if it's slightly above his perceived value.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly (or implying other buyers exist), you create a subtle sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one approach.  Depending on your negotiation style and your read on Bob, you might adjust the price and message."
