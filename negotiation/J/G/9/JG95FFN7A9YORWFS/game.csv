"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, I have a limited budget for this purchase. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $9,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better deal, but I'm getting close to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for you. Let me know if this works for you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
