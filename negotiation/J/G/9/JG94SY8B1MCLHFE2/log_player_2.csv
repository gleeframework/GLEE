Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $71 is your final offer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm willing to go up to $73. It's the highest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $73.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $73
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is unlikely to go below $73, and you're only saving a few dollars at this point. John offers a guaranteed price of $80, which is better than risking a higher price from Alice in the remaining rounds."
