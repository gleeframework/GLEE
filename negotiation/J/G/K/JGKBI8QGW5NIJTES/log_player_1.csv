Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $9,000.  Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $9,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, but still ensures a significant profit for Alice.
* **Time Value:** Offering it to Bob first at a slightly discounted rate recognizes the potential for a faster sale than waiting for John. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
