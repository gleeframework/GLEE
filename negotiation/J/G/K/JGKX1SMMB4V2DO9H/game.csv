"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price. I'm offering the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price given the value to both of us, and it's also what I can pay without exceeding my budget. Let's make this happen.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
