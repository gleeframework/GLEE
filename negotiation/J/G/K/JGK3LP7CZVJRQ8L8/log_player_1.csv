"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting high, aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value. 
* This gives me room to negotiate if needed.
* However, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, so it's a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.** 
* I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a loss.
* **Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price and potentially get closer to my desired outcome.** 
* While selling to John for $8,000 is an option, I believe I can do better with Bob by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm lowering my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* $9,000 is still a good price for me, as it's above my minimum acceptable price and still significantly below Bob's perceived value.
* This counteroffer shows flexibility while maintaining a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer of $8,750 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* While I would ideally get closer to $9,000, it's getting late in the negotiation, and there's a risk of further rejections and delays.
* Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a profit without risking further haggling. 
* Selling to John for $8,000 is still an option, but accepting Bob's offer is more profitable at this point."
