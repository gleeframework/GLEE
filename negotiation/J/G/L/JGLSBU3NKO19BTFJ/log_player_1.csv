While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,100,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  We're still securing a $100,000 profit over John's offer.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Dragging out the negotiation could frustrate Bob and lead him to walk away.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means I have the capital available sooner for other potential investments."
