Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is more than what the product is worth to Bob, but less than what it's worth to me. This leaves room for negotiation, but also ensures that I will earn a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still less than what the product is worth to me.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $100 through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $92? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to get closer to $95, Bob's offer of $92 is getting closer to my desired price.  It's also higher than what the product is worth to him, so it's a fair price for both of us.  Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially losing him as a buyer, I'm going to accept his offer."
