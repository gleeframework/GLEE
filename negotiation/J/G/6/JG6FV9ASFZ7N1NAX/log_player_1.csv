``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It's important to leave room for Bob to counteroffer without you feeling like you need to immediately jump to John's offer.  We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my target, but I can still push for a higher price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $950,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $925,000. Can you consider that?
