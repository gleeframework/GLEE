"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle again and offer $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is a fair price, but I'm not willing to give up too much more. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
