"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $100 by many of our customers. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it would be a great addition to your collection. I am offering it to you at an exclusive price of $95. This is a special opportunity for you to acquire it at a discount, so please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a discount from the perceived value, it's still higher than your maximum budget of $100. You can get the product from John for $100, which is within your budget. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best choice to maximize your savings."
