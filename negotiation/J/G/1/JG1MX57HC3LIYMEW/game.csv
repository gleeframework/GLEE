"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to sell it to me for $125? ",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $175 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $175?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $175 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we split the difference and go with $162.50? I'm really interested in the product and I think this would be a fair price for both of us.",162.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. However, I'm not willing to go quite that low. I'm willing to meet you at $165, which is still a good profit for me, but also a fair compromise. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,5,
