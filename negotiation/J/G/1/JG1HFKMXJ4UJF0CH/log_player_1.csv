"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still potentially attractive to Bob. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering $85. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still maintaining a price that's above my minimum threshold. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, as I'm getting closer to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's my minimum acceptable price, it's still better than selling to John for the same amount. It's important to note that I'm at the halfway point of the negotiation, and there's still room for Bob to increase his offer in future rounds.  However, accepting this offer ensures I don't miss out on a potential deal."
