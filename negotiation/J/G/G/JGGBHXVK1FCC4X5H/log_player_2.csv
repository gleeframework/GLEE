"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it's a valuable asset, and I believe it has the potential to be incredibly beneficial for your business. My initial offer is $1,000,000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While the product might be valuable, it's significantly above Bob's maximum budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $1,000,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a fair price considering my maximum spending limit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $850,000 is significantly lower than the value I place on this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000. This would still allow me to make a profit, and it's a fair price considering the benefits this product offers. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price.  While it's closer, it's worth trying to negotiate further to see if they can reach a price closer to Bob's budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit above my comfort zone.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's in our best interest to reach an agreement. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your persistence. However, $850,000 simply isn't a viable option for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a final price of $900,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product offers.  Let's finalize this deal and make it mutually beneficial. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $900,000, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. There are still a few rounds left, and Bob has a solid alternative in John.  It's worth seeing if Alice will go lower, or if Bob can make a counteroffer that gets them closer to a deal.  There's no need to rush into a deal that is still above his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. $900,000 is still a little high for me. I'm going to propose a final price of $875,000. This is a reasonable compromise and I'm confident it's a price that makes sense for both of us. Let's finalize this and move forward."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $875,000 is still too low for me. To bridge the gap and finalize this deal, I'm willing to offer a final price of $890,000. This reflects a significant reduction from my initial position, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's reach a mutually beneficial agreement and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $890,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price. With only a few rounds left, it's not clear if they can reach an agreement. Buying from John for $800,000 guarantees Bob the product at his desired price and saves him both time and potential for further negotiation."
