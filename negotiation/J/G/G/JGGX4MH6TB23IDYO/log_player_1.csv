Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find useful. I'm willing to part with it for $99. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $99 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested, but still ensures you make a profit if he accepts outright.
* **Strategic Pricing:** This price is just above Bob's perceived value ($80) but significantly below your guaranteed sale price ($100). 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale."
