"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $750,000? I believe this would still be a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your interest in the product. While $750,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to compromise slightly.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $850,000, which still reflects the significant value this product offers. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
