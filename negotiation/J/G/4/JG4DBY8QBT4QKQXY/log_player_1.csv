Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Can you meet me at that price?

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We're running out of time, and $14,200 is pretty close to my minimum. It's better to secure the deal than risk losing Bob completely and having to settle for John's offer of $12,000."
