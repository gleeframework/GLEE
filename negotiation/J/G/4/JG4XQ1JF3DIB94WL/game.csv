"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $9,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I understand your budget, but $9,000 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would allow both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is closer to my budget. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $9,500 is still below my minimum.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000. I'm still a bit hesitant at that price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This would be a fair compromise, and we could both close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750. This price allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's close this deal and both benefit from this fantastic product.",10750.0,Alice,7,
