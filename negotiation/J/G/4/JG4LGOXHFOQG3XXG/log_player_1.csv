I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob is interested.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I want to test the waters and see if he's willing to pay a higher price. If he rejects, I can always fall back on selling to John for $8,000."
