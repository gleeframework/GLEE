Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always beneficial to start with a higher price to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $100 gives room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal, while still leaving a good profit margin for me.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and open approach helps keep the negotiation positive.

**Important Note:**  This is just an initial offer. I'm prepared to negotiate further based on Bob's response and to ultimately accept a price that's better than my minimum of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  $90 is significantly higher than my minimum of $80 and is within a reasonable negotiating range.
* **Avoid Risk:** Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob completely, especially if I counteroffer too aggressively. 
* **Time Efficiency:**  Accepting the offer saves time and effort compared to further negotiation."
