Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the tone for a strong negotiation. If Bob is seriously interested, he'll likely counter with a lower offer.  I'm prepared to negotiate from this starting point. If his counteroffer is too low, I can either counter again or walk away and take John's offer of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While $600,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm confident I can get a higher price, and I'm not willing to settle for a significant loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $900,000. This is a compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial asking price.  I believe this offer is fair, considering Bob's initial offer and the value I place on the product. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not enough. I've already made significant concessions and am not willing to go lower.  I've set a clear minimum value for the product, and I'm comfortable taking John's offer to ensure I get a fair price. This is a good deal for me, and it avoids further negotiation that might not be fruitful."
