"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and your budget. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and settle on $837,500? This feels like a fair compromise that respects both of our positions.",837500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $837,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",850000.0,Alice,5,
