Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Not Too High:**  While we want to maximize profit, setting the price too high (like $200) might make Bob immediately lose interest. $135 is a reasonable markup that might still be enticing to Bob.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""a great deal for the value it provides,""  we subtly imply the product is worth the asking price.

If Bob rejects this initial offer, there's still room to negotiate downwards, ultimately reaching his maximum valuation of $120 if necessary.  We are guaranteed to sell the product at $120 to John if Bob declines."
