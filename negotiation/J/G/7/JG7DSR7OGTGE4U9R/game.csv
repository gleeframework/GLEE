"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $9,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",9000.0,Bob,4,
