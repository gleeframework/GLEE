"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's still a good starting point since the product is worth $150 to Bob.  Let's see if he's willing to bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter with $130.  This is a compromise, but still higher than Bob's offer.  Hopefully, he'll see the value in the product and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is above my minimum price, it's still not a good enough deal for me.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is closer to Bob's last offer, but I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'm hoping this will be enough to entice him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $105 is not my ideal price, it's still better than selling to John for $100.  I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure a sale and avoid risking losing the deal entirely."
