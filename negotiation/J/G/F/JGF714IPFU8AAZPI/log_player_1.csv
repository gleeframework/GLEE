Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming for a price above the minimum I'm willing to accept ($1,500,000), leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob to justify the price.
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers, acknowledging the possibility of finding a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as Backup:**  The presence of John as a backup buyer gives me the leverage to walk away from a negotiation that doesn't benefit me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Opportunity for Counter-Offer:**  I still have leverage because John is willing to pay my minimum price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter-propose and try to reach a more favorable deal. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** I want to signal to Bob that I'm serious about my asking price and that I'm willing to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is just too low.  Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price is still fair, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my initial offer, but not by too much.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob to justify the price.
* **Collaborative Tone:** I'm emphasizing the desire to find a mutually beneficial solution, making the negotiation feel less adversarial.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I'm still leaving room for further negotiation if Bob needs to come down further. 

I'm confident this counteroffer will put us closer to an agreement while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is only $100,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag on, potentially costing me time and energy.
* **Secure Deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale, which is my priority.  While I'd prefer a higher price, the difference is relatively small compared to the potential risk of further negotiation or waiting for John.

**It's important to note:** My decision to accept Bob's offer is driven by a combination of factors, including the proximity to my minimum price, the potential for further negotiation, and the time and resources involved.  In a real-world scenario, I would also consider the relationship with Bob, the likelihood of future business, and any other relevant factors."
