Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000 for the product. What are your thoughts?

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation. I'll reject the offer and try to get a lower price in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $900,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount of $50000 from my initial price, bringing the price down to $1150000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1000000. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, but I'm still only $50,000 away from my absolute maximum budget. There's still a chance we can find a middle ground. I'll reject her offer and see if we can close the deal at my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to be close to your target price.  However,  $1,050,000 is still just a little out of my reach.  I'm willing to offer $1,025,000, which is a good compromise for both of us.  I'm confident this is a fair deal, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1025000. I'm willing to make another small concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer it to you for $1075000, but I'm not going any higher than that. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has continued to negotiate but her offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, there is a risk that the price will not drop to my acceptable level within the remaining rounds.   It's safer to buy the product from John for my target price."
