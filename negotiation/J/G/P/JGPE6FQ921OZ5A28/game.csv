"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. In light of our discussion, I would like to refine my proposal. I am willing to consider $1,150,000 as a more reasonable starting point for this transaction. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while remaining accessible for you. Please let me know if this suggestion is something you would be interested in considering.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  To be honest, $1,150,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
