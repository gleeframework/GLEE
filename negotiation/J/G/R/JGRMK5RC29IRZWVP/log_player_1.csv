Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $900,000.  This is a bold move, but it maximizes my potential profit. Bob values the product at $800,000, so there's room for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  I'm always prepared to fall back to John's offer of $800,000, which guarantees me a solid return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  However, it's not so far off that I should immediately accept it.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation.  If Bob wants this product, he'll have to meet me closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $850,000. This is a compromise, but I'm still holding firm on my minimum acceptable price.  This counteroffer shows Bob I'm serious about selling, but also that I'm not desperate to accept his low offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable.  It's clear he's not willing to meet me anywhere near my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price,  I don't want to risk further rounds of negotiation with Bob. I'm going to take John's offer of $800,000. This guarantees me a good return, and I can move on to other potential buyers."
