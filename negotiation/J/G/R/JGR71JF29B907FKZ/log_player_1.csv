Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $120, aiming slightly higher allows you to potentially earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $119 is just below your minimum acceptable price but still a significant markup from Bob's perceived value. This increases the likelihood of him accepting the offer.
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly, preventing him from overthinking and potentially declining."
