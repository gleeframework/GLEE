"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $180. This is a one-time offer, and I'm excited to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  You're looking to spend no more than $80, and her offer is $100 more. It makes sense to reject this offer and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $180 is too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $80 for the product. I'm sure we can find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is at your absolute maximum price. You're upfront with Alice about your budget and establish a starting point for negotiations. It also demonstrates your willingness to compromise and reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but $80 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $120. I'm willing to compromise to find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a step in the right direction, $120 is still above your budget. It's worth continuing negotiations to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $120 is still a bit more than I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can agree on a price that's fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer moves you closer to Alice's offer, showing your willingness to compromise.  $95 is still within your budget, and hopefully, Alice will see this as a reasonable offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $95, which is $107.50. Let's see if we can meet at this price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $107.50 is still outside of your budget.  You're close, but it's worth trying to get a little closer to your target price of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $107.50 is still a little too high.  Let's split the difference again. How about $101.25?  I'm confident we can find a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 101.25} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're showing a willingness to compromise by meeting Alice halfway again.  $101.25 is still within your budget, but it's getting close to the limit. This could be your final counteroffer before going with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $101.25 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise. Let's meet at $110, which is the midpoint between $107.50 and $112.5. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your ideal price, $110 is still above your maximum budget of $80. At this point, the negotiations have gone on long enough, and it's likely that Alice won't go lower.  You're better off buying the product from John for $80, which guarantees you the best deal within your budget."
