Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth at least $800,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  This leaves you room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **It's a round number:** This makes the offer seem clear and concise.

I've also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to reach a deal with him, accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss.  It's better to continue negotiating or sell to John for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $850,000 is my absolute bottom line.  This still represents a great value for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer:** This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not give away too much.
* **Counteroffer is lower than my initial offer:**  This shows flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Clear and concise message:**  I reiterate the value for Bob and emphasize the compromise being offered."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $810,000. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider meeting me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $810,000 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price.  Considering the possibility of further negotiations and the risk of Bob backing out completely, accepting this offer seems like the best choice.  It allows me to secure a sale and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation or selling to John at a lower price."
