Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** The minimum you'll accept is $12,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $10,000 to him.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $10,000 and $12,000. Any price within this range can lead to a deal.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so aiming closer to $12,000 is ideal. However, you don't want to scare Bob away. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it can be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $11,500, given its quality and the benefits it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** We start with a positive and enthusiastic tone. Highlighting the product's value to Bob can make the price more palatable.
* **Price:** $11,500 leaves some room for negotiation but keeps you firmly within the profitable range.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start a bit lower, leaving room to come up.
* **Relationship:** If building a long-term relationship is important, a more accommodating approach might be beneficial. 

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate and adjust your approach based on Bob's response."
