"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend. How about $12,000?  That's a fair price considering what it's worth to me, and it leaves some room for us both to be happy.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,
