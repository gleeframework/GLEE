This offer starts at a high price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges the value the product holds for Bob. This approach aims to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend. How about $12,000?  That's a fair price considering what it's worth to me, and it leaves some room for us both to be happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is above my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's room for improvement. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
