{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe there's a chance for a slightly higher price. I'm not ready to settle just yet and will counteroffer in the next round.  We are getting close to the deadline, though, so I'll be more cautious in my next move."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

With only two rounds left, I'm going to accept John's offer.  Although Bob's offer is my minimum, I don't want to risk not getting a deal at all. It's better to secure the guaranteed price of $1,200,000 from John."
