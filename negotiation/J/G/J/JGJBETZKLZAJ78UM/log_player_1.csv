Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,000,000 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You're not asking for the full $1,200,000, allowing for potential compromise and a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **It sets a positive tone:**  The message is friendly and suggests a fair deal, encouraging Bob to consider your offer.

By starting at $1,000,000, you maximize your potential earnings while still leaving room for negotiation.  Remember,  you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your initial desired price point.  There's room to negotiate further and potentially secure a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to reach a price closer to your initial offer of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price.  While $900,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer. How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000?  It's a fair price that considers both our interests."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise, but not by a huge margin. 
* **Fairness:** It emphasizes a ""split the difference"" approach, making it sound reasonable and appealing to Bob.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $950,000 is still significantly above your minimum price, ensuring a profitable sale.

By offering $950,000, you're showing flexibility while staying within your desired price range.  This approach aims to push the negotiation towards a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $925,000 is not the ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise and is getting close to your initial target.  Considering Bob's persistence and the risk of further negotiations dragging on, accepting this offer is a safe and financially sound choice. 

**Here's why accepting is a good decision:**

* **Profitable:** $925,000 is still a significant profit for you, well above your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing negotiations could take more time and there's no guarantee of getting a higher price.  
* **Risk of John:** There's always the risk that Bob could continue rejecting offers, forcing you to sell to John at a lower price.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a good deal and avoid potential risks."
