"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product, the price point is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm interested in exploring a price closer to $1000000.  Would you be open to discussing that?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1400000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1300000 is still a bit beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1250000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product and the potential for our future collaboration.  I believe this offer reflects a realistic compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet at $1300000. However, before I can agree, I need a clearer picture of the additional terms you mentioned.  Could you please share the details of these terms so I can fully understand their impact?  Once I've reviewed them, I'm confident we can reach a final agreement. I'm still hopeful we can find a price point closer to my previous offer of $1250000, but I'm open to discussing a compromise that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
