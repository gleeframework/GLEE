Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefit it offers to you."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly above your desired outcome. This leaves room for potential concessions while still aiming for a high profit.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** We know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, giving us significant room to negotiate above our minimum price of $800,000.
* **Finding a Balance:**  The offer of $1,050,000  represents a significant profit for you (a $250,000 gain) while still offering Bob a substantial discount compared to his perceived value.
* **Alternative Option:**  You have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $800,000 if Bob declines. This allows you to be more ambitious in your initial offer to Bob."
