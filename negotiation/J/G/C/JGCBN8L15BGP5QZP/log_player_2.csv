"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $1,800,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $1,000,000."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for you to come up during the bargaining process. 
* **Significant Difference:**  By offering $1,000,000, you signal that Alice's initial price is far too high and that a significant adjustment is needed.
* **Leaving Room:** This counteroffer leaves you space to negotiate upwards towards your $1,200,000 maximum while still staying below John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your range, but $1,400,000 is still above your ideal price and what John is offering.  You have room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to consider $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** Instead of making another large jump, this counteroffer increases your previous offer by $100,000. This shows you're willing to move towards her price, but not drastically.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price point puts you just below your maximum budget and above the midpoint between your last offer and hers.  It aims for a compromise while still leaving you room to negotiate. 
* **Pressure Point:**  By staying below your $1,200,000 limit, you maintain the option of going with John's offer if Alice doesn't budge enough."
