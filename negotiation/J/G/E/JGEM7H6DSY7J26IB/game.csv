"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a generous offer, considering the product's true worth is $1,000,000 to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $600,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's value.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a significant investment for you, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $700,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your position. However, I'm afraid I can't meet that price point. My absolute best offer is $650,000. If that's not workable, I understand, but I'm hoping we can find a solution.",650000.0,Bob,6,
