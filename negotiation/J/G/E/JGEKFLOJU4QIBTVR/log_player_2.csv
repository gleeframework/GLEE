Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $110 for it.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is coming down on price, her ""final offer"" of $110 is still more than John's offer of $100.  There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, and we are trying to save as much as possible. Accepting John's offer guarantees the best price."
