"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm happy to discuss a price that makes sense for both of us. To start the conversation, I propose a price of $1,150,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's desired maximum price of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter-offer and try to get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of the product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but the value of this product to me is quite significant.  I could come down slightly to $1,125,000. I believe this still reflects the true worth of what you're getting and is a reasonable compromise.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's desired maximum price of $1,000,000. Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible, so he should reject this offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.  Let's make this our final exchange: $1,100,000.  This is my best and final offer, as I believe it's a fair price that accounts for the value you're gaining.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,100,000 is still above Bob's desired maximum price of $1,000,000.  While it's closer to Bob's ideal price,  Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  It's likely that further negotiation will not result in a price lower than $1,000,000.  Therefore, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for the guaranteed price of $1,000,000."
