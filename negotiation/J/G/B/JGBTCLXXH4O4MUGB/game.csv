"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get closer to my target price. Can you meet me halfway?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make a reasonable profit. How about $1100000? That's a good compromise, and it still leaves you with a significant value for the product. Let's find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we compromise at $1050000? That's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to pay a premium for the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1075000? This price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints.  Let's close this deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
