Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us. You get a valuable product at a fair price, and I get a solid profit. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get closer to my target price. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob is clearly interested in the product and is willing to pay a premium, indicating he values it highly.  Rejecting his offer allows me to explore other options and potentially get a better price in subsequent rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make a reasonable profit. How about $1,100,000? That's a good compromise, and it still leaves you with a significant value for the product. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we compromise at $1050000? That's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to pay a premium for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still holding out for a higher price.  Bob is clearly motivated to buy the product, and his counteroffers are getting closer to my desired price.  While I'm not thrilled with $1,050,000, I'm confident I can secure a better deal with a few more rounds of negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000? This price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we compromise at $1080000? That's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to pay a premium for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is very close to my desired price and is significantly higher than what I could get from John. With only 4 rounds left, there's a risk that Bob might not offer more, and I might have to settle for John's offer. It's a good compromise, and I'm confident I can make a profit even at this price."
