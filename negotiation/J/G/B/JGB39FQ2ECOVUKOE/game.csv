"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. It's worth a significant amount to me, so I'm asking for $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I'm willing to walk away if this isn't acceptable to you.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,200,000 is tempting, I need to be closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the slight reduction, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,150,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still not within my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,100,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I can't go any lower than $1,200,000.  This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you.  Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,050,000. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
