Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""While I appreciate the offer, $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering my value for it and your need to sell."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price, considering the value I've already established for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, he still has room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. There are more rounds left and he can continue to try and bring the price down."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still above my comfortable range. I'm prepared to offer $10,000 for the product.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to move closer to my price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, which is a compromise between our previous discussions. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject the offer. While the price is getting closer to his budget, he still has room to negotiate further. There are still several rounds remaining, and it's worth trying to get the price down even more before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000 again, but this time I'll throw in a small concession: I'll include a one-year warranty on the product. This is a significant added value, and I believe it's worth considering. I'm still confident that $11,000 is a fair price for the product and the warranty. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While the added warranty is tempting, Bob should still reject the offer. He has only 3 rounds left, and he can still try to bring the price down further. He's only $2,000 away from his target, and there's a chance Alice might budge even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the added warranty, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,750 for the product with the warranty. This is a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both place on this product and the added warranty."", ""product_price"": 10750}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, but this time I'll throw in a second-year warranty on the product. This is a significant added value, and I believe it's worth considering. I'm confident that $11,250 is a fair price for the product and the warranty 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has only one round left and is still $3,250 away from his target price. Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but it's unlikely she'll come down to his desired price in just one round.  It's better to take the sure thing and buy from John for $8,000."
