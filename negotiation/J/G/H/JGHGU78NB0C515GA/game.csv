"I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think it's worth a serious consideration. I'm willing to start with an offer of $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"While I appreciate the offer, $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering my value for it and your need to sell.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price, considering the value I've already established for the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still above my comfortable range. I'm prepared to offer $10,000 for the product. This represents a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value we both place on this product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to move closer to my price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, which is a compromise between our previous discussions. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair offer.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000 again, but this time I'll throw in a small concession: I'll include a one-year warranty on the product. This is a significant added value, and I believe it's worth considering. I'm still confident that $11,000 is a fair price for the product and the warranty.",11000.0,Alice,7,
