"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $10,000 for it. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $10,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is still a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my desired price.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I've already made a counteroffer and she rejected it. It's likely that she won't budge much lower, and continuing to negotiate could prolong the process.  Buying from John at $8,000 guarantees I get the product at my desired price point, so it's the most efficient choice."
