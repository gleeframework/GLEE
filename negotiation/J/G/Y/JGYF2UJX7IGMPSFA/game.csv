"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm looking to sell to the right buyer. I'm thinking of a price of $120 for it. Would you like to make an offer or accept this price?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see that $90 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can offer you a price of $110, which is a bit closer to what I'm looking for. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $110. Could you consider a price of $100?,100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and my original offer of $120, which would be $110. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. How about we meet at $110?",110.0,Alice,5,
