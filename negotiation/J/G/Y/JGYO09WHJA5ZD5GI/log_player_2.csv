Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your maximum price. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $1,000,000, as I believe the product is worth more to you. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,080,000.
