Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $17,000 on it. Would you consider lowering the price to $16,000? I think we could find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
