"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's something truly special, and I believe it has the potential to be a game-changer for you.  To start, I'm proposing a price of $2000000. This reflects the value I place on the product, but I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial price.  What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1800000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $1800000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still a bit off. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1900000.  I believe this price still reflects the exceptional value of the product, and it gives you a great opportunity to benefit from its potential. Let's see if we can make this happen.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

I'm still not convinced that $1900000 is the best price for the product. I'm willing to pay $1750000 for it. Can you consider this offer?,1750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1750000 is significantly below what the product is worth. To demonstrate my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1850000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your interest and allows me to make a worthwhile profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",1850000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1850000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1725000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1725000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we might be stuck in a rut. While I appreciate your continued interest, I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  To move forward, I'm going to need to stick with my previous offer of $1850000. It's a fair price that reflects the product's potential, and it gives us both the opportunity to benefit from this deal. Let me know what you think.",1850000.0,Alice,7,
