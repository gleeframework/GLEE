"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $90 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $105. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, and hopefully, it's a more enticing offer for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a bit more. While $95 is close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}

I'm offering the product for $100, which is my minimum acceptable price.  It's a fair offer, and hopefully, Bob will accept it."
