"Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",200.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your honesty. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my original asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $175. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $150?  Let's close this deal.",150.0,Bob,4,
