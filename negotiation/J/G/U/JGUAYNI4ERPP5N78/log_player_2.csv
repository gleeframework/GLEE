"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Not Insultingly Low:** While low, $7,000 isn't so far off from Alice's value of $8,000 that it would be immediately offensive. There's a chance Alice might accept if she's eager to sell. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This first counteroffer helps me gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on price. Her response will give me valuable information for future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $7,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to negotiate. How about $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down in price, but not by much.  We know she values the product at $8,000, so there's still room for her to move before reaching her minimum.  We'll continue negotiating to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I'm getting closer, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Going For It:** We now know that Alice is willing to negotiate somewhat. By offering $8,000, we're hitting her exact value for the product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a chance Alice might reject this offer and try to push for a slightly higher price.  However, there's also a good chance she'll accept, as it's a fair price for her and we're showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 10 rounds, we need to start getting closer to a deal. Delaying much longer increases the risk of running out of time and having to go with John's offer."
