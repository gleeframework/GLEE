"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum price.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the chance to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal. Buying from John at this point would be less advantageous as Bob can potentially get a better price through negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. Offering $9,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and could be attractive to Alice.  It also gives Bob a starting point for negotiation and allows for potential compromises in the next rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price. At this point, buying from John would be a safer option, but Bob still sees room for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway. $9,500 is a compromise between Bob's previous offer of $9,000 and Alice's current offer of $11,000. This shows Bob's willingness to negotiate and could lead to a successful agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's desired price and getting closer to John's offer. At this point, the risk of further negotiation with Alice outweighs the potential savings. Buying from John ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation rounds that could lead to a stalemate or even a higher price."
