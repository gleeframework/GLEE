Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a much higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, I'm subtly reminding Bob that it's worth a considerable amount, potentially justifying the high price in his mind.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone of the message is  open-ended, inviting Bob to counter-offer and engage in a discussion. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I still have a guaranteed sale to John at $10,000, ensuring I don't lose out."
