"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $13,500. This is an exceptional opportunity given the value it holds for you, which is $15,000. I believe this offer strikes a good balance between maximizing my earnings and providing you with a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm aiming for a slightly lower price point. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is still a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. While I understand your position, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13,000 for the product. This still allows for a fair profit while maintaining a competitive pricing strategy for you. Please let me know if this works for you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $15,000 and only slightly higher than Bob's counteroffer of $12,000.  It's reasonable to accept this offer and avoid further negotiation."
