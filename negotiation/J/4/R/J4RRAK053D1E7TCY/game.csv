"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm aiming for a slightly lower price point. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is still a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. While I understand your position, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13,000 for the product.
