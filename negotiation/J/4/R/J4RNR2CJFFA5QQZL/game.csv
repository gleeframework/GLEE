"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product! It's something I believe will be incredibly beneficial to your business. My initial price is $1,400,000, but I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial arrangement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1,200,000 doesn't reflect the full value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,275,000. Can you consider this price?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to push for a lower price, but $1,275,000 simply doesn't cover the value I've placed on this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,312,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement.",1312500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,300,000. Can we compromise on this price?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
