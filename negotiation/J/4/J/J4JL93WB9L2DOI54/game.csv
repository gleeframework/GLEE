"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $9,000 for the product.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise that still gives me a decent profit, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $10,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. If you're willing to meet me at $10,000, I'm willing to make the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Alice,5,
