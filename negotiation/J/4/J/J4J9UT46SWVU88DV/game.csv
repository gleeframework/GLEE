"I understand that $850000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell the product to you for $925000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $925000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $875000.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still above what the product is worth to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
