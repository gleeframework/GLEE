While Alice is getting closer to your desired price,  $925,000 is still above what you know the product is worth to her.  You can still try to get a better price."

Alice has come down to her lowest acceptable price of $900,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering your maximum budget is $1,200,000.  There's no guarantee that you'll get a better price in further negotiation, and you risk losing the deal altogether. It's a good time to accept the offer."
