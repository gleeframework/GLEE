Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11999}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, since that's what John will pay. 
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Psychological Pricing:**  $11,999 seems significantly ""cheaper"" than $12,000 in the mind of a buyer, even though the difference is minimal.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, so she can afford to be slightly bolder with Bob."
