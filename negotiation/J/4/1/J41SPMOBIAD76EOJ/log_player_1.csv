Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the product is worth less than $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I understand his perspective, $900,000 is significantly below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I receive a price closer to the product's true value."

Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I've already expressed interest in the product. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this product. How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've decided to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. While I'd like to get a higher price, Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum threshold, and we're running out of rounds. Selling to John ensures I receive a fair price and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
