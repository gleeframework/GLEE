"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $75 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I understand it's a good product, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could you do it for $90? That's a pretty big jump from my last offer.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  $90 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $105?  That way we both get a good deal. ",105.0,Alice,5,
