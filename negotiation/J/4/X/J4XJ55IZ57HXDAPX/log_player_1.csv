"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, I can still get $10,000 from John. I'm going to try to see if I can get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer to Bob."

Bob's offer:

``` 

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. While I would have preferred to get more from Bob, I'm not willing to go lower than $9,500.  Selling to John guarantees me a good price and avoids the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob."
