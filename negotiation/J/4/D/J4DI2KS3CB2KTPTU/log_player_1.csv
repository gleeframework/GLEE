{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90. It's a great deal and I think you'll really enjoy it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum ($80) but also leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $90 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $85 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $80. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.
