"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its value. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that the product has significant value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
