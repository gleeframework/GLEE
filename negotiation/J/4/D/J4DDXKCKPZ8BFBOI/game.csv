"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about we split the difference at $10,500? This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about we try $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,750 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference again - how about $10,125? This is a fair compromise that would allow both of us to walk away happy. What do you think?",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $10,125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think I can only go up to $9,900. Can you consider this offer?",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. However, $9,900 is still quite far from what I need to make this deal work. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This would be a reasonable compromise that allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's close this deal now.",10000.0,Alice,7,
