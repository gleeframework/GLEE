"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $100 leaves room for negotiation while still being a good starting point. 
* **Highlighting value:** Emphasizing the product's value to Bob helps him see the potential benefit of buying it.
* **Open-ended approach:** Ending with ""Let me know what you think"" encourages Bob to respond and allows the negotiation to continue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal is to maximize profit:**  While $90 is better than $80 (selling to John), I'm aiming for a higher price closer to the product's worth to Bob ($120). 
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob has shown willingness to negotiate. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $90 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $95? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within range:**  $95 is a compromise that's closer to my desired price but still leaves some room for Bob to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:**  The message focuses on finding a solution that benefits both of us, making it more likely Bob will accept.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly and collaborative tone can encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $92? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $90 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a reasonable price:**  $92 is getting close to my desired price point. While a bit lower than my last counteroffer, it's a good compromise that ensures a profitable sale.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and a good profit.
* **Limited rounds:** We are already in Round 4, leaving only 6 rounds before I need to sell to John. Accepting now secures a better price than selling to John."
