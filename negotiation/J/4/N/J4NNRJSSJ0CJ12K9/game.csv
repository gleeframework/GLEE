"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your life. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll counter with a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value to you and my original asking price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still above my limit. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is closer to my budget and a fair value considering the product's worth to me. Let's try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to ensure I get a reasonable return on my investment. I'll counter with a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that takes into account the product's value to you and my original asking price. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer and is very close to my maximum budget.  I truly believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $975,000. I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not quite there yet. I'll counter with a price of $1,025,000. This is a final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
