"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your life. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob.  It's a good starting point for negotiation, but Bob should reject and counteroffer to save money."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll counter with a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value to you and my original asking price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,100,000 is still significantly more than Bob's maximum budget.  It's better to keep negotiating to see if Alice will come down further. There's still room for a compromise."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $975,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  At this point, it's better for Bob to stop negotiating with Alice and buy the product from John.  While he won't get the best possible deal, buying from John will ensure that Bob stays within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
