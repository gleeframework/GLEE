Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $9,500 is significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** It's below Bob's perceived value of $10,000, so there's room for him to counteroffer.
* **It shows confidence:** By offering a price closer to your perceived value, it shows you're confident in the product's worth.

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than selling to John for $8,000, there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher amount in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  This would still be a great value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a decision soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $8,750 is a good compromise. It's a significant improvement over selling to John and it seems Bob is serious about closing the deal.  I'll accept his offer."
