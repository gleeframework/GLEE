"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you and this is a competitive price considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

It's better to reject Alice's offer. While $11,500 is close to your limit, you know you have a guaranteed option with John for $12,000. There's a chance you can get Alice's price lower or get the product from John at your maximum price."
