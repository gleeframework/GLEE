Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you and this is a competitive price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John provides a safety net, Alice can be bolder in her initial offer to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he is willing to pay."
