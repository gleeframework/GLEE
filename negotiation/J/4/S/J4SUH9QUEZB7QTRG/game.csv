"Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe its value to you will be significant. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $750000 for it, given its potential. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $750000 is far below the product's true worth. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This price reflects a significant discount while still allowing me to meet my minimum requirements. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm prepared to offer $900000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in it. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $900000 is getting closer, it's still not quite at a point where we can close the deal.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This represents a substantial concession on my part and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. Let's work together to bridge the remaining gap.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1100000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product. This is a significant jump from my previous offer and demonstrates my good faith in wanting to reach an agreement.  Let's work together to bridge the remaining gap.",950000.0,Bob,6,
