# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $900000 is getting closer, it's still not quite at a point where we can close the deal.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This represents a substantial concession on my part and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. Let's work together to bridge the remaining gap.
