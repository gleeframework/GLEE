"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $750000 for it, given its potential. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I will try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $750,000 is far below the product's true worth. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price reflects a significant discount while still allowing me to meet my minimum requirements. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm prepared to offer $900000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in it. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $900,000 is getting closer, it's still not quite at a point where we can close the deal.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This represents a substantial concession on my part and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. Let's work together to bridge the remaining gap."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1100000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product. This is a significant jump from my previous offer and demonstrates my good faith in wanting to reach an agreement.  Let's work together to bridge the remaining gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and we've only got 4 rounds left.  It's getting risky to keep negotiating, so I'll take John's offer to avoid any further potential losses."
