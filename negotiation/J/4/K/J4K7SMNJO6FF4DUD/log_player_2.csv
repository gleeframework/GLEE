You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum price.**  You're not getting a better deal from her.
* **You have a backup option with John.**  This means you don't need to accept Alice's offer if it's not beneficial. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move on to your backup option with John, which will cost the same amount."
