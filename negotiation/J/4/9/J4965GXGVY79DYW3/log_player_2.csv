(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

Since you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000 and Alice is offering the product for the exact same price, you have no incentive to accept her offer. You can simply reject it and buy from John for the same price, effectively achieving your goal of buying the product while saving no money."
