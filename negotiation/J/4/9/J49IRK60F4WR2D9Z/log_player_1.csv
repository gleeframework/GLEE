Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.  To kickstart our negotiation, I propose a starting price of $2,300,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting your counter-proposal. While $1,800,000 is a respectable figure,  I believe it doesn't fully reflect the true value and potential this product holds for your business.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle at $2,050,000. This offer reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer and making a new proposal, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating strong interest. We're still significantly above John's offer, so it makes sense to counter and see if we can push closer to $2 million."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. It shows you recognize the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be realistic about the value I'm offering. How about $1,975,000? This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1975000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with the offer. I'm willing to pay $1,850,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While we're still above John's offer, Bob's increases are getting smaller. Accepting at $1,850,000 secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away if we push further."
