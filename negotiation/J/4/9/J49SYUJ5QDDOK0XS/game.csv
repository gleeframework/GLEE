"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate.  $110 is a bit too low for me, but I'm open to a compromise. How about $115?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to get a good deal.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget at $115. Would you be willing to meet me at $112? I'm really interested in the product and I think we're close to a deal.",112.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $112 just isn't quite enough for me.  I'm willing to go down a little further.  How about we split the difference and agree on $113?  Let's make this deal happen!",113.0,Alice,5,
