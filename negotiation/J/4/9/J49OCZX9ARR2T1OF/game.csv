"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000 to meet you halfway. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
