"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product! I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, Bob can still potentially get a better deal.  He knows the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, and he has a backup option with John at that price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, but $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth a bit more than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is getting closer to Bob's maximum price, but it's still more than he's willing to pay.  Since Bob has a guaranteed option with John at $1,000,000, it's in his best interest to take that option and avoid further negotiation.  There's a risk of continuing negotiation, getting into a bidding war, and potentially ending up paying more than $1,000,000."
