"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks great, $20,000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we try $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While $11,500 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This is my final offer, as I do have another interested buyer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
