(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks great, $20,000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we try $11,500?"", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While $11,500 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This is my final offer, as I do have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $15,500. While you *might* be able to negotiate her down a bit further, it's getting risky. You have a guaranteed offer from John for $12,000, which meets your needs. It's better to take the sure thing and save the most money."
