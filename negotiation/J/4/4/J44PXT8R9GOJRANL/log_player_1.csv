Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I do see its value, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product within my budget and you to still get a solid return on your investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
