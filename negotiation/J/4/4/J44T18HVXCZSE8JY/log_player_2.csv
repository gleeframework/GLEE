"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $22,000 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way too high. It's over my budget and I'm sure I can get a better deal. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm only willing to pay $12,000 right now. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows her that I'm serious about negotiating and sets a lower starting point for the negotiation. I'm still above John's offer, so there's room for compromise, and this gives Alice a reason to consider my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is too low for me.  This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm not desperate to buy from Alice, so I'll reject her offer and continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go to $15,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm happy to walk away if it doesn't work for you."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my second counteroffer, so I'm raising my price slightly to show I'm serious about negotiating but still within my budget. I'm also setting a firm limit by declaring it my ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Alice to consider it seriously. If she rejects it, I'm ready to move on to John's offer."
