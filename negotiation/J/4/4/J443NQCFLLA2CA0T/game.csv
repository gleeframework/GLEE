"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make an initial offer of $950000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1000000. I'm open to negotiating, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given the product's value to me and my budget, I'd like to propose a price of $850000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate from. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product is worth more than $850000. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $900000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to pay $875000 for the product, which is closer to the value I see in it.  Let's work together to bridge this gap.  What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $885000. This is the lowest I can go and still ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. What do you think?",885000.0,Alice,5,
