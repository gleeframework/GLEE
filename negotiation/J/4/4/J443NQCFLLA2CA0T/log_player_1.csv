Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given the product's value to me and my budget, I'd like to propose a price of $850000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate from. What do you think?
