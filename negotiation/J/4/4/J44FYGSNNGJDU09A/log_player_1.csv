"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate and allows me to gauge Bob's interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's not worth selling for that low of a price, especially since I have John as a backup buyer. I will reject the offer and continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price to $125, which is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me. I'm not willing to sell it for under $150, and with John as a backup buyer, I can afford to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's at least $10 above my minimum acceptable price of $150. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell.  I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, but I'm still ready to walk away if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to settle for less than $150 and I'm still confident that I can get a better price from Bob or even John. I will reject the offer and continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm lowering my price again to $105. I'm starting to feel the pressure as rounds are dwindling, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about finding a middle ground and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I need to make a decision. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target price of $150. I've lowered my offer significantly, and I don't want to risk further negotiations.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $150 from John and avoid the uncertainty of potentially reaching a lower agreement with Bob."
