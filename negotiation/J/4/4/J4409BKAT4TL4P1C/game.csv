"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit above your budget, but I believe the product's value to you is worth more than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,150,000. I'm confident that this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of the product to me.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your increased offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,125,000. I believe this price is a reasonable compromise that takes into account the value you place on the product.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $1,125,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,110,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product for me.",1110000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000, which is just $10,000 more than your latest offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you, and I'm willing to accept it as a final offer.",1120000.0,Alice,7,
