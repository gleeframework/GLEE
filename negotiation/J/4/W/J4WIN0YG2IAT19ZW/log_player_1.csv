Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  I want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, which is my guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering it slightly below my ""walk-away"" price leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's inclined, potentially getting me even closer to $15,000.
* **Urgency:** I haven't explicitly mentioned John, but the high price implies I'm confident in the product's value and someone else might be willing to pay a premium.

This strategy aims to balance getting the highest price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough to avoid going to my backup buyer, John."
