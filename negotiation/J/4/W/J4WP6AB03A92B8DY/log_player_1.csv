{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it will be valuable to your business as well.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice. However, $1,750,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I understand his budget limitations,  $1,200,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable value. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 just isn't feasible for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still reflects the value of this product.  I believe this price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $1,400,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement.  I'll counter with a price that's more in line with my valuation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, let's try to close this deal.  I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,500,000. This price is a good compromise, and it reflects the value I see in the product. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm getting close to my limit of rounds, and I'm not comfortable dropping below $1,500,000. John has consistently offered a fair price, and it's time to close the deal."
