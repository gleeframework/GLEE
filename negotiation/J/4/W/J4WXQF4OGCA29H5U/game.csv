"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $2,300,000 represents a fair value considering the product's potential, I understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000.  I believe this price point reflects a win-win for both of us.  What do you think?",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $2,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $2,050,000. Can you consider my revised offer?",2050000.0,Bob,4,
