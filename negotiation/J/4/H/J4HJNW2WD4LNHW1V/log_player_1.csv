Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting with a price of $150 offers a 25% profit margin over your minimum. This is a reasonable starting point in many negotiations.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the message implies the price is firm, it leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer if he's highly interested but finds $150 a bit too high. 
 
**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $150. However, this strategy gives you the best chance to maximize your profit while still having the safety net of selling to John."
