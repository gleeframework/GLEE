Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" adds a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision faster.

**Why this strategy is better than offering at $1,200,000 directly:**

* **Risk of Anchoring:**  Offering at Bob's maximum perceived value might anchor him to that price, making it harder to negotiate if he's hesitant. 
* **Missed Opportunity:** There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay slightly above $1,150,000, and starting lower allows you to potentially capture that extra value."
