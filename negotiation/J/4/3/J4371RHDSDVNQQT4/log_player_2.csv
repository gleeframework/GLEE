# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Alice's offer of $11,000 is less than your maximum price of $12,000 and it's cheaper than buying from John.  This saves you $1,000."
