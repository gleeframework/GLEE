Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it's worth a lot to both of us, so I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  This reflects its true value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation and my minimum, I leave room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** I provided a reason for the high price (""true value""), aiming to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth.
* **Gauge Interest:**  This initial offer helps me gauge Bob's eagerness and potentially secure a much higher price than my fallback option with John.  

**Important Note:** While I have a guaranteed buyer, my goal is to maximize profit. This strategy aims to do so, but I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or rejects the initial offer."
