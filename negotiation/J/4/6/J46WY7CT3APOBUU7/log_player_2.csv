"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $11,500 is still too high, and there are more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is still a bit low.  How about we split the difference and go with $11000? This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $11,000 is lower than the previous offer, it's still not the best deal for Bob. There are more rounds to negotiate, and Bob can still try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still leaning towards $10,500. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're sticking to $10500.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go down to $10750. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he would prefer to pay $10,500, $10,750 is still a good deal for him, and the negotiation is progressing. There's no guarantee that Alice will continue to lower her price in the next rounds, and Bob could end up buying from John for $12,000."
