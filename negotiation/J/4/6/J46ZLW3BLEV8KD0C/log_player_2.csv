"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $20,000. I believe this is reflective of its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to negotiate towards a price closer to your budget and significantly lower than Alice's initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $8,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant decrease from Alice's offer. It establishes a starting point for negotiation and signals that I'm serious about buying but need a price within my budget. While it's a low offer, it leaves room for negotiation and allows Alice to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $16,000 is still too high. We need to keep negotiating to reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice. However, $16,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate upwards while staying within a reasonable range of my budget. It also encourages Alice to continue lowering her asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $10,000.  Would you be willing to do $13,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly and this offer is within Bob's budget. While it's slightly more than buying from John, it's a reasonable compromise to secure the deal with Alice."
