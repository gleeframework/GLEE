Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a good starting point. Here's why:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $12,000 is still higher than what Bob thinks the product is worth, giving him incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  $12,000 is less than your minimum value of $15,000, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's positive and encouraging:** The message is friendly and focuses on the benefits of the deal for both of you.

Let me know what happens next!  We can adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is tempting, it's far below my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for such a low price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10,500? This still leaves room for you to make a profit, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer above Bob's offer but below your minimum:** This shows you're willing to negotiate but still protecting your minimum.
* **Focus on benefit for Bob:** Highlighting the potential profit margin for Bob can make him more receptive.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  Keeps the negotiation open and friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,250 is still less than my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum.  Considering the possibility of further negotiations with Bob, and the risk of losing him as a buyer, accepting this offer seems like the best course of action.  It's a good compromise that allows me to make a sale and still get a decent price for the product."
