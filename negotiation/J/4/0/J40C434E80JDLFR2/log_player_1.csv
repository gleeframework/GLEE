Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering Bob the product for $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's lower than his perceived value ($15,000) but still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($12,000). This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring I don't lose out on a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

I'm counteroffering Bob with $13,500.  This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between his offer and my previous offer. It shows flexibility while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although it's closer to my minimum, it's still a profitable sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation. It's likely that Bob wouldn't offer any higher, and risking further negotiation could result in me having to sell to John at a lower price."
