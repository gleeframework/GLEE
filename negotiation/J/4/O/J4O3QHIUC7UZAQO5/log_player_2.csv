"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. It's a game-changer in its industry, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $15,000.  There's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $8,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000? I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 6000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. I can see you're a serious buyer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $6000. I'm willing to come down to $9000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm not in a rush and I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price of $6,000.  There's still room for negotiation and I want to explore if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $7,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value of the product.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm glad to hear you're interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which is $8500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is a better offer than Alice's previous one, it's still significantly higher than my desired price of $6,000. I'm not ready to accept this offer, and I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm willing to continue exploring potential deals that are closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $7,500, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let's find common ground and get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $8000, which is the minimum I can sell the product for. I'm confident you'll find it valuable, and I'm willing to compromise to make this happen. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,000 is closer to my target price of $6,000, and I'm starting to run out of rounds. It's likely that we won't be able to agree on a lower price with further negotiation.  I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
