"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. It's a game-changer in its industry, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $8000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Would you be willing to come down to $6000? I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. I can see you're a serious buyer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $6000. I'm willing to come down to $9000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $9000 is still too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $7000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value of the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm glad to hear you're interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which is $8500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $7500, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let's find common ground and get this deal done.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $8000, which is the minimum I can sell the product for. I'm confident you'll find it valuable, and I'm willing to compromise to make this happen. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,7,
