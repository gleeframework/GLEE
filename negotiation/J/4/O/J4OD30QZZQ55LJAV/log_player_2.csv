"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice further. You can offer a lower price and see if she's willing to come down."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

While $900,000 is closer to your budget, it's still outside your ideal range. You can counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $850,000. There's room for further negotiation before resorting to buying from John."
