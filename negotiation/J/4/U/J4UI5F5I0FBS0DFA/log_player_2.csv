I am offering it to you today at an exclusive price of $95. This is a great opportunity to acquire a product that matches your needs and expectations at a competitive price. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $100. You're willing to pay up to $100, and rejecting Alice's offer means you can still get the product from John at that price."
