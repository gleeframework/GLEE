"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's above your value for the product and still within my price range. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $8,500 is a bit below your original price, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
