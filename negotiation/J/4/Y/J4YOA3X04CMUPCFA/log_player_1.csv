Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk Mitigation:**  By offering a higher price, I'm acknowledging the uncertainty of Bob's valuation. If he rejects the offer, I still have a guaranteed buyer in John.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** If Bob values the product more than $1,500,000, he is likely to accept the offer. This would give me a much higher profit than selling to John.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** This higher price acts as a starting point for negotiation. If Bob counters with a lower offer, I have room to negotiate without sacrificing my minimum acceptable price.

While this strategy carries some risk, the potential for higher profit outweighs the risk of losing Bob as a buyer, as I have John as a backup."
