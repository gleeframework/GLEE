"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you is $10,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $8,500. It's a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stick to a tighter budget, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $8,200. It's a bit above your latest offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
