"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,500,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further,  I'm offering you the product for $1,350,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still well within your stated value of $1,500,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,300,000 for the product. This is the maximum I can afford, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
