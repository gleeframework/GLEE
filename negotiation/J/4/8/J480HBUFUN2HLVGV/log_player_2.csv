Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $13,500. This is a fair compromise that I think we can both live with.

While $13,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. He should continue to negotiate and try to get the price closer to his desired $10,000."

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000.  Alice has consistently been above Bob's maximum price point. While $13,000 is closer, Bob is better off with the sure thing of John's deal."
