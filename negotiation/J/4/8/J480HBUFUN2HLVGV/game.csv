"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to pay $10,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $13,500. This is a fair compromise that I think we can both live with.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $11,750.  I'm confident we can finalize a deal at this price.",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to split the difference, and I appreciate the effort. However, $11,750 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, which is closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.",13000.0,Alice,5,
