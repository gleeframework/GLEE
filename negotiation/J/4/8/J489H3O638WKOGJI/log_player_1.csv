"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it'd be perfect for you.  I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than John's offer ($150) to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly and encouraging message sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Focus on value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, which might make him more receptive to my offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $175 is not my absolute bottom line, leaving space for counteroffers and potential compromises."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm rejecting this offer and will counter with a price closer to my desired range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $145. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by reducing my price, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Focus on the value proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify my price. 
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm keeping the communication friendly to encourage Bob to keep negotiating.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** $145 is still above my minimum, allowing for potential future compromises."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to $145. There's still a chance I can get a better price, and I'm not ready to settle for a price significantly below my minimum just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $137.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 137.5}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price exactly between my previous offer ($145) and Bob's last offer ($130). This shows a willingness to compromise and a desire to reach a deal.
* **Focus on fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise that benefits both parties. This can appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  I'm remaining positive and encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 

I'm still aiming for a price closer to $145, but this counteroffer shows my willingness to negotiate and reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $135 is still a bit below my desired price, it's only $2.50 less than my last counteroffer.  We're getting close to a deal, and there's a high chance Bob will not budge further.  It's better to accept his offer now and secure the sale, rather than risk losing him and having to sell to John at a lower profit."
