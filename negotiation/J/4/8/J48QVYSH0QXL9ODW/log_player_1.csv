{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

This offer aims for a good compromise.  It's significantly higher than my minimum of $800,000 but still leaves room for negotiation and ensures a substantial profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is better than selling to John, it's still far below what I consider a fair price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $950,000 is a significant profit for me and a good deal considering the value of the product to Bob. It's also much better than selling to John for $800,000. Let's close this deal."
