"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can definitely do better than $1,200,000.  He has a clear advantage knowing the product is only worth $800,000 to Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows him to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this transaction.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob still has room to negotiate a lower price.  He can likely get it for less than $1,000,000, given Alice's willingness to negotiate and the fact that the product is worth $800,000 to her. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to potentially get a better price."
