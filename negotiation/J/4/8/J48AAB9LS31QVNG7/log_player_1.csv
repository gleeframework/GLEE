"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This sets a high bar and gives me room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaving some room for further bargaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, $925,000 is a very good price and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
