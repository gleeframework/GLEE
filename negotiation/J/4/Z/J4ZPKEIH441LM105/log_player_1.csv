Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  I put a lot of value on this product and $10,000 wouldn't quite make up for letting it go. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $12,000 mark I need.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
