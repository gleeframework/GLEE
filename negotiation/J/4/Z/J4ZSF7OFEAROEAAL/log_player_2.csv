"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's first offer is pretty close to my maximum budget. I should try to negotiate a lower price in the next rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell it to you for $75. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $75 is better, I think I can still get Alice a bit lower. It's still early in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we settle on $70? That would be a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your offer, Bob! I'm willing to go a bit further and sell the product to you for $72. I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to meet me halfway.  $72 is a good price, and continuing to negotiate might make me lose out on the deal altogether."
