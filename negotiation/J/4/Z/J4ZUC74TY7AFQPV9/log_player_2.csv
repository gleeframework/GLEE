"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think it would be very valuable to you, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $140 is lower than her value for the product, you know you can get it for $120 from John.  You're better off rejecting this offer and securing the lower price."
