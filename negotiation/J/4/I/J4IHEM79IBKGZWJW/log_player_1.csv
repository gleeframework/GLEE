Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. While I recognize the value you place on the product, $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000, a price that shows my sincere interest and allows us to both reach a favorable agreement. This is my final offer.

Bob has signaled this is his final offer, and while it's not the $1,200,000 I aimed for, $1,150,000 is a strong price. It's better to accept a good offer now than risk pushing him away and potentially getting stuck with John's lower offer."
