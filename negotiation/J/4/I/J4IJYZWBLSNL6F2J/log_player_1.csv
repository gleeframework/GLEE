"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,700,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than what I would like to receive.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,550,000. This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it's closer to my desired price.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but I'm still not ready to accept it. It's not even close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to get a better deal in the next round by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,450,000. This is still above Bob's last offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise.  I believe this is a fair offer that balances my desired price with the need to make a deal before time runs out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, and I'm starting to run out of time.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, it's becoming clear that Bob is not willing to meet me halfway.  To avoid risking losing out on the deal entirely, I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000. This ensures I get a price I'm comfortable with and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
