"I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the value I believe this product holds, I'm willing to meet you partway. How about $1,350,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its potential.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
