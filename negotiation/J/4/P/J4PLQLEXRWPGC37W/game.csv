"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for it. Can we discuss further?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm happy to finalize the deal if you accept.",950000.0,Bob,4,
