# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price. Alice's offer is above your target price, so rejecting it makes sense to see if you can get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for it. Can we discuss further?

While Alice's offer is closer to your target price, it's still above your maximum. You can try to negotiate a lower price, and if that fails, you can always buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1,020,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.

Alice's final offer of $1,020,000 is still above your target price. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $1,000,000 and save yourself $20,000."
