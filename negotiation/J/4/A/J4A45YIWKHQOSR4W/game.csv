"Hi Bob, I'm selling this unique product that I think would be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $20000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $20000 is above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $10000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $10000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept $17000 for it.  Let's find a way to make this work.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17000 is still out of my price range.  I'm prepared to pay $12000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach an agreement. What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12000 is simply too low for me.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to drop the price to $15500.  This is a fair price that allows me to cover my costs and gives you a great value on the product.  Let's close the deal at this price.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $14000, which is a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",14000.0,Bob,6,
