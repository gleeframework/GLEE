"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think it's a fantastic deal at this price. Would you like to buy it from me for $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
You're trying to save money, so rejecting the first offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price with Alice is the logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at the moment. Would you be willing to do $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob! I can do $90, but I have to say, I'm getting a bit skeptical about the price dropping too low. Would you be willing to meet me at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You're still looking to save money, and while $90 is better than $95, you can likely get a better price.  Rejecting and counter-offering again is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $85. How about we split the difference and go with $87.50?"", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your thinking, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $87.50 just yet. How about we compromise at $92.50? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice is coming down in price, you're still looking to save more.  Rejecting and counter-offering again is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $92.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $89. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 89}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to meet you at $89. I'll try to find a sweet spot between $92.50 and $89. How about we aim for $91? It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

You've successfully negotiated the price down significantly from Alice's initial offer of $95. While you might be able to squeeze out a couple more dollars, the risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away (or you having to buy from John for $100) is not worth it. $91 is a good price and a win for you."
