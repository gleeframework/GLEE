I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think it's a fantastic deal at this price. Would you like to buy it from me for $95?,95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at the moment. Would you be willing to do $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob! I can do $90, but I have to say, I'm getting a bit skeptical about the price dropping too low. Would you be willing to meet me at $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $85. How about we split the difference and go with $87.50?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like your thinking, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $87.50 just yet. How about we compromise at $92.50? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $92.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $89. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",89.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to meet you at $89. I'll try to find a sweet spot between $92.50 and $89. How about we aim for $91? It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable",91.0,Alice,7,
