"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe will be a valuable addition to your collection. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.** You'd save $100,000 by accepting Alice's offer.
* **Even though Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her, it's still within your budget.** You are willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and Alice's offer is lower than that."
