Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While I'd like to get closer to $15,000, Bob is consistently moving upwards and we are getting into the later rounds. Accepting $14,000 ensures a deal gets made and avoids the risk of Bob dropping his offer further or me being forced to take the $12,000 backup."
