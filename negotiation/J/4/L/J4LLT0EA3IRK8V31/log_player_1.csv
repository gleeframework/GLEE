{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it extremely valuable.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're already securing a profit above your minimum of $800,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can potentially go higher if Bob is willing, but this price is still attractive to him.
* **It shows you're serious:** This offer demonstrates that you're willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Keep in mind that this is just the beginning of the negotiation. You'll need to carefully consider Bob's response and adjust your strategy accordingly.  Remember, you can always choose to sell to John if you feel you're not getting a good enough price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price, and it's a long way from the value the product holds for him. While you are willing to negotiate, it's important to maintain your position and not cave in to a significantly lower offer so quickly."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $700,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $850,000? This price still allows you to realize significant value while offering me a fair return on my investment. Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we settle at $775,000? It's a significant move from my previous offer and could be a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $775,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired price and the product's value to Bob. You're willing to negotiate, but you can push for a more advantageous deal.  A counteroffer will show Bob that you're serious about getting a price that reflects the product's worth."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire for a good price, but $775,000 still falls short.  I'm prepared to make a final concession -  I'll accept $825,000 for the product.
