"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $700,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $850,000? This price still allows you to realize significant value while offering me a fair return on my investment. Let's try to find a compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we settle at $775,000? It's a significant move from my previous offer and could be a win-win for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a good price, but $775,000 still falls short.  I'm prepared to make a final concession -  I'll accept $825,000 for the product. This offer is fair and allows us both to walk away satisfied. If you decline, I'll have to explore other options.  ",825000.0,Alice,5,
