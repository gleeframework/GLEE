"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting offer is too close to our maximum budget. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This strategy aims to gauge Alice's willingness to lower the price and get us closer to our target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but it's still above our target. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to $70."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle on $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

We're nudging our offer up slightly to show willingness to compromise, but we're still aiming for a price close to our initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a price that works for both of us.  $75 is still a bit low for me.  I'd be willing to accept $82, my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has signaled this is her final offer. While slightly above our ideal price, it's a reasonable deal compared to John's $100 offer, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the opportunity for any savings."
