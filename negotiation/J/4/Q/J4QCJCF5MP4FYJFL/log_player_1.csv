"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning the negotiation significantly above my minimum price ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""valuable"" and ""potential,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth without revealing my own bottom line. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  Phrases like ""starting price"" and ""what are your thoughts?"" invite Bob to engage in the negotiation process, making him feel like an active participant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own stated value. While I want to negotiate, accepting such a low offer early on would set a weak precedent and likely result in leaving a lot of money on the table. I'll counter-offer to bring the price closer to our target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?"",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging but Firm:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer to show I'm engaged in the negotiation, but I'm also standing firm that his initial price is too low. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify a higher price.
* **Compromise:** By suggesting we ""meet in the middle,"" I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum. This keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  I'm still interested but $1,750,000 is a bit high for me. How about $1,400,000? I feel that's a fair offer considering the value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is now getting closer to my minimum price, but I believe I can still get more. It's still early in the negotiation (only round 4 out of 10), and I'm willing to push a little further. Accepting $1,400,000 at this stage might make Bob think I'm willing to settle for less than my product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer, and I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, I need to get at least $1,550,000 for this product to make it worthwhile for me. This is a very competitive offer given the value you're getting. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:** I'm starting by acknowledging Bob's effort and progress in the negotiation. This helps maintain a good rapport.
* **Revealing a ""Bottom Line"":** I'm introducing a price slightly above my actual minimum ($1,500,000) to give myself a little wiggle room while still aiming for a strong outcome.  By saying ""to make it worthwhile for me,"" I'm subtly hinting at this being close to my limit without outright revealing it.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he's receiving, reinforcing the idea that my price is justified. 
* **Direct Question:** I'm ending with a direct question to prompt Bob's response and hopefully encourage him to accept or make a counter-offer close to my target."
