"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  I'm still interested but $1,750,000 is a bit high for me. How about $1,400,000? I feel that's a fair offer considering the value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, your offer is getting closer, and I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, I need to get at least $1,550,000 for this product to make it worthwhile for me. This is a very competitive offer given the value you're getting. What do you say?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
