Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth. Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Knowing John offers $1,200,000 sets a strong baseline, but it's not about squeezing Bob dry. The goal is to find the highest price Bob is likely to accept.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $1,150,000 is a significant amount above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys value and positions the offer as beneficial to Bob, increasing the chances of acceptance.

**Why not higher?**  Going too close to $1,200,000 risks immediate rejection. Bob gains little from accepting, making it more likely he'll walk away. This offer balances profit potential with the risk of losing the sale."
