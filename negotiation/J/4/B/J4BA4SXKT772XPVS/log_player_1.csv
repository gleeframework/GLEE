"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. This allows for a potential compromise without immediately resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $12,000 right now. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to close a deal, I'm not willing to drop the price that much.  I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your product is valuable, but $16,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's my final offer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but he's getting closer.  I'll counter again and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. $14,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $15,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15,000 is still more than I can afford.  My final offer is $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.  If you reject this offer, I'll have to move on to other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still too low.  I've been through several rounds, and I'm not sure if we'll be able to agree.  To avoid risking a further decline in price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's still a good deal and guarantees me a sale."
