"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential for you.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the value you've described, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. While your offer is reasonable, I'm aiming for a slightly higher return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire for a higher return, but $1,250,000 is still beyond what I can realistically pay.  Let's meet at $1,100,000.  This would be a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away with a reasonable deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's settle this now - $1,175,000, and we have a deal.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,175,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at $1,125,000.  This would be a fair price that allows both of us to achieve our goals.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
