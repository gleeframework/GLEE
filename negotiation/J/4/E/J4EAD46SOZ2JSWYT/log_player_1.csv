Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential for you."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the value you've described, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer matches my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. While your offer is reasonable, I'm aiming for a slightly higher return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?"",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for a higher return, but $1,250,000 is still beyond what I can realistically pay.  Let's meet at $1,100,000.  This would be a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away with a reasonable deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and I'm not ready to settle for a mere $100,000 profit. I'll counter again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's settle this now - $1,175,000, and we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,175,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at $1,125,000.  This would be a fair price that allows both of us to achieve our goals. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is clearly very interested but has a firm limit. Accepting his $1,125,000 offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely."
