Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this fantastic product at a price that's sure to be attractive. I'm starting at $9,500, knowing this is a great deal for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm ready to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a backup buyer in John. I'll counteroffer Bob and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $8,750 is still below my threshold. I'm still confident that I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a backup buyer in John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,750 is still below my desired price.  I'm willing to meet you at $9,250.  This represents a compromise, and I'm hopeful we can finalize this deal. Let's find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
