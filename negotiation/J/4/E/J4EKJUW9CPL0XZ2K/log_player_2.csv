"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this fantastic product at a price that's sure to be attractive. I'm starting at $9,500, knowing this is a great deal for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $9,500 is still too high for him, and he can get the product for less from John. It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a better price with Alice first, though."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm ready to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's still trying to get the product for less than $9,000. He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so he still has room to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,750 is still below my desired price.  I'm willing to meet you at $9,250.  This represents a compromise, and I'm hopeful we can finalize this deal. Let's find common ground! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Even though Alice is willing to come down a bit, the price is still too high for Bob, and he can get the product for a much lower price from John.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point."
