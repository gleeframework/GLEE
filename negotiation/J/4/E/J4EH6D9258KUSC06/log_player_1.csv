Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 is a good price, I'm looking for a bit closer to my asking price of $95. How about we split the difference and settle on $90? It's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $87.50? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $87.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $89?  It's just a small step up from your offer, and it would be a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 89}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting close to walking away from the deal, but I'm still willing to make one more offer. I'll meet you halfway from your latest offer, so how about $88? That's the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While $88 is still below my desired price, it's getting closer, and I only have 4 rounds left. There's a chance Bob might walk away if I keep rejecting, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
