"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would you consider selling the product for that amount?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a budget of $80, but unfortunately, that's just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $110?  That's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still unable to meet you at $110. Could you consider lowering the price further to $95? This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a solution, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $105, which I believe is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've been considering our previous discussions, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be open to discussing a price of $100 for the product?",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet halfway, but $100 is still a bit too low for me. To make this work, I'd need to come down to $120. That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,7,
