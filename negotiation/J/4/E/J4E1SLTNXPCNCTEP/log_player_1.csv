"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us room to negotiate and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I also want to show that I'm serious about getting a good price for my product, but I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum of $1,000,000, it's still not enough for me. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating with Bob to try and get a better price. I still have 8 rounds left, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, showing Bob that I'm flexible and willing to meet him halfway. I still believe this price is fair, considering my product's value to me and the potential upside for Bob. This also gives me a good starting point for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold.  I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating with Bob. We have more rounds left, and I'm confident I can get closer to my goal of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway this round and offer him the product for $1,000,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I believe it's still a good deal for Bob considering he values the product at $800,000.  This is a ""take it or leave it"" offer, as I'm running out of time. If he rejects, I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me. With only 4 rounds left, I don't have time to continue negotiating.  I'll accept John's offer of $1,000,000, which meets my minimum price.  While I would have liked to get more, it's important to be realistic about time constraints and ensure I secure a good price."
