"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe you might find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is a bit high. It's worth seeing if we can negotiate down to a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives us room to negotiate upward.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message is framed politely and expresses interest while suggesting our proposed price is a fair starting point. 
* **Strategic Goal:** Our goal is to get the product as close to Alice's value ($100) as possible while staying within our own budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  Could you meet me halfway at $117? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress, but not there yet:** Alice moved closer to our desired price, indicating she's willing to negotiate. However, $117 is still significantly above her value.
* **Leverage:** We still have rounds to negotiate and the option to buy from John. This gives us some leverage to push for a better deal. 
* **Next Move:** We'll continue to incrementally increase our offer in the next round, but we need to be mindful of not going over our $150 absolute limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. How about $110? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're increasing our offer by $5, showing willingness to move towards a deal.
* **Fairness:** We're positioning the offer as a compromise, aiming for a price that benefits both parties.
* **Strategic Position:** We're still below Alice's offer, putting the ball back in her court while keeping within a reasonable range of our budget and her likely minimum acceptable price."
