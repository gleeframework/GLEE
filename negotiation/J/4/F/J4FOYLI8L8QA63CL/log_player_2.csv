"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $95 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. I'm willing to negotiate, hoping to get a price closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $95 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's, aiming to see how flexible she's willing to be. There's a chance she'll reject this outright, but it leaves me room to negotiate upwards while still staying below my $100 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $85?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating, which is good. However, $85 is still too high considering her product's worth to her is $80. I'll counteroffer and try to meet closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. How about we settle for $78? It's closer to your asking price while still fitting my budget."",
""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

I'm inching closer to her price, showing I'm willing to compromise. This offer is still below my max, leaving some wiggle room if needed, but it's a strong offer considering her known valuation of the product."
