"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your operations.  My asking price is $1450000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to you.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but Alice is asking for $1,450,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price. 
* **John's offer is a backup option.**  If you can't reach a deal with Alice, you can always go to John, but it's better to try and save money. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to send Alice a counteroffer that's lower than $1,450,000 but still higher than $1,200,000 (what it's worth to Alice)."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1350000 is a bit too low for me at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This reflects the value the product brings to you while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  I'm confident this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what you're willing to pay.**  While she's come down from her initial price, $1,400,000 is still above your maximum budget.
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better price by making another counteroffer.
* **John's offer is still a backup option.**  If you can't reach a deal with Alice, you can always go to John, but it's worth trying to negotiate further.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to send Alice another counteroffer, aiming for a price lower than $1,400,000 but higher than $1,200,000. You could try a price close to the middle, like $1,375,000."
