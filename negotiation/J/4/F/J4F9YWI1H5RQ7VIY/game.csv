"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to work with me, but $1450000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $1350000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my budget. Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1350000 is a bit too low for me at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This reflects the value the product brings to you while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  I'm confident this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1400000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $1375000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that's within my range and closer to your asking price. Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
