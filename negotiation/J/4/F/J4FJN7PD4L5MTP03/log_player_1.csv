Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential:** Since Bob values the product at $10,000, starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a price above Bob's perceived value.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell it at no loss. 
* **Strategic Ambiguity:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing my absolute bottom line, leaving room for Bob to potentially counter-offer."
