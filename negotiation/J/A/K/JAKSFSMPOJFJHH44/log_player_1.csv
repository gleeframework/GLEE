Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me, hoping to get a good deal. If Bob rejects, we can negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm lowering my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to what the product is worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $130 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum price and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
