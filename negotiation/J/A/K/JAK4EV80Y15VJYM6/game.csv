"Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my desired value.  I'm prepared to sell for $1,350,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's find a way to make this work.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
