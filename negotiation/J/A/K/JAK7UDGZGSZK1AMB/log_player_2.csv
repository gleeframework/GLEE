(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, there's no reason to accept it immediately.  You have 10 rounds to negotiate and potentially get a lower price. By rejecting the offer, you open the door for potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 33% discount. This is aggressive but shows I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if necessary. It also leaves room for compromise in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows for further potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to compromise. This keeps the negotiation moving forward while still aiming for a substantial discount compared to Alice's initial offer and John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now below my initial counteroffer, and we've gone through several rounds.  While I might be able to squeeze out a bit more, the risk of further negotiation leading to a breakdown is increasing.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the potential of having to buy from John at a higher price."
