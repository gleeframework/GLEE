"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for the product.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to $9,000 to make this work. How about $8,500? It's a fair compromise, and it's still within your range.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? That's a significant jump from my previous offer.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,750 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to see a price closer to $8,250. It's a reasonable midpoint that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,900. I feel this is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while staying within my budget.",7900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer, but $7,900 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,100. This price acknowledges the product's value while remaining within a reasonable range for you. Let's try to close this deal.",8100.0,Alice,7,
