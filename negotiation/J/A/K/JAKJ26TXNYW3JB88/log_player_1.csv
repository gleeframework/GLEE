Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $1,100,000 is a good starting point as it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **Open to Counteroffers:**  The message is friendly and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to counteroffer if he wants. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll be prepared to either accept a counteroffer closer to my minimum price or to reject it and make a new counteroffer.
* If the negotiation stalls, I can always switch to John, who is guaranteed to buy at my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering its value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price:**  While it's a step closer to my target, $1,050,000 is still below my $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I have room to counteroffer and potentially increase the price further. 
* **John is a backup:** If the negotiation with Bob continues to stall, I can always fall back on John's guaranteed $1,200,000 offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, aiming to meet him halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a bit low. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000. I'm confident this price reflects the value you'll get from the product.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price exactly halfway between my previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($1,050,000). This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive language (""appreciate,"" ""confident"") to keep the negotiation amicable and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $1,075,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll be ready to either accept a counteroffer closer to my target or make another counteroffer if necessary. 
* John is still my backup option if negotiations with Bob fall through."
