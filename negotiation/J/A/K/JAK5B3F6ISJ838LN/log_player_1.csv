"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product has potential, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me right now.  How about we settle around $1,100,000? I think that's fair given the current market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $1,100,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further but need a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price is still very fair considering the product's value and potential.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I see the value at $1,250,000, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,150,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1,150,000 is still too low.  I believe the product is worth more than that, and I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $1,200,000 at this point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm confident this product can generate significant returns for your company.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,225,000.  This represents a substantial discount from my original asking price, but it's the lowest I can go while still making a reasonable profit.  I'm hoping we can come to an agreement on this final offer."", ""product_price"": 1225000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting close!  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit and offer you $1,175,000.  I'm hoping that shows my seriousness about getting this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm running out of time, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. It's a guaranteed sale and I'm not willing to risk losing more money in further negotiation."
