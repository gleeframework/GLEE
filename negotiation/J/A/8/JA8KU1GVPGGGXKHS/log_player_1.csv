{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's above my minimum price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's also close enough to Bob's perceived value of $100 to make him likely to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  How about $88?  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is tight. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $88 is close enough to my desired profit margin.  It's better than selling to John for $80, and I think it's likely that we won't be able to get a better price."
