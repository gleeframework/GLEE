{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than my minimum value of $80, but still lower than Bob's perceived value of $150. This leaves room for negotiation and hopefully ensures that we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $100?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll counter his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
