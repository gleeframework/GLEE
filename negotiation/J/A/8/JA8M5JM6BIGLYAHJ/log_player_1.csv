Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This is a high opening offer, but it gives me a good starting point in the negotiation.  I'm willing to drop down to John's offer of $100, so I have some room to negotiate.

I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $90 for the product. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get a better deal.  Bob is already showing interest, and I want to see if I can push him a little higher.  By rejecting his offer and counter-offering, I can potentially get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something closer to my asking price.  How about $95?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to counter with $95. This is still a good price for Bob, and it's closer to my ideal selling price. I'm confident that Bob will be willing to pay this amount, especially since he already rejected a lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has come back to his original offer of $90.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $100. It's also a good deal for Bob. There's a risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with nothing, so it's better to take the offer now and secure the sale."
