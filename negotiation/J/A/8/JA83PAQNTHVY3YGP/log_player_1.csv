{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  This is a great deal for you, considering the value you place on it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price closer to the middle of our perceived values, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I'll assess Bob's response and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I'm not ready to accept just yet.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price range with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and we can close this transaction quickly."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, Alice. While $10,500 is better, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $9,500 is close to the middle ground between our desired values.  It's also significantly better than selling to John for $8,000.  I'll accept this offer and move on."
