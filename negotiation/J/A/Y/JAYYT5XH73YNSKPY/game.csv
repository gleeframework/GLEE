"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1,100,000. This is a compromise that should be more in line with what you're looking for, while still being a good deal for me.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I place on this product. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. ",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $950,000 is still short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is as close as I can get to your offer while still meeting my minimum requirements.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
