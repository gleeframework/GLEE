Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I'll be prepared to negotiate downwards if needed, but I want to start strong."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm reducing my price slightly but still maintaining a significant margin.  I believe this offer is fair and could potentially be accepted by Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now close to my minimum acceptable price, and I believe it's better to secure the sale with him than risk further negotiation and potentially losing him as a buyer.  It's also likely that further negotiation will take time, and selling to John would yield a smaller profit."
