{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$6,500 is a good price, but there's always room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can get a better deal before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer. It's unlikely Alice will accept this immediately, but it establishes a lower price point and gives me room to negotiate upwards if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down a bit, but $6,000 is still too high for me. I want to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer by $500, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. This is a reasonable compromise that might lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above my desired price point, but she's getting closer. I'm going to continue negotiating and see if I can get her down further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5750}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but by a smaller amount this time. I'm trying to find a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's latest one.  Hopefully, this shows Alice that I'm serious about closing the deal but also that I'm not willing to pay more than $5,750."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my target price, I'm still not comfortable with $6,375. I'm going to continue negotiating. We're close to a deal, and I'm confident that I can get her down further with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but this time by a larger margin.  It's getting close to Alice's last offer, and I want to see if she's willing to meet me in the middle.  If she doesn't, I'll have to consider buying from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer has returned to her initial price of $6,500. I've already made several counteroffers and it's clear she's not going to budge much lower. With only one round left, it's not worth risking a further stalemate.  I'll buy from John for $10,000. It's a higher price, but it guarantees I get the product and saves me the potential for a complete breakdown in negotiations with Alice."
