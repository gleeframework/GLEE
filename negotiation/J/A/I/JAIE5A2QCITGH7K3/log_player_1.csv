"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  A positive message encourages Bob to engage and sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Mentioning the product's value subtly reminds Bob of its worth and justifies the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $100 I need to get from the sale.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a price slightly lower than my original offer. 
* **Exploring Options:**  I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price before potentially selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a great deal. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's still a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a friendly tone encourages Bob to keep negotiating.
* **Fair Compromise:**  $90 is a fair compromise considering my minimum and Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $82.50. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $82.50 is still significantly below my minimum price of $100.
* **Risk of Losing to John:**  While I'm nearing my minimum, I don't want to risk selling below my desired price. 
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I'll make one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my goal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. But $82.50 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $87.50.  That's a good price for a product of this quality.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a small compromise to show good faith while staying above my minimum.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation positive.
* **Value Reminder:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Final Offer:** This could be my final offer before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still looking for a price that's closer to $80. Would you be willing to meet me at $82? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk of Reaching Minimum:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. If I reject Bob's offer, there's a strong possibility that his next counteroffer will be even lower, pushing me closer to my minimum. 
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:** John offers a guaranteed $100, which is well above my minimum and provides a comfortable profit. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** It's better to secure a guaranteed profit with John than to risk ending up with a lower price from Bob."
