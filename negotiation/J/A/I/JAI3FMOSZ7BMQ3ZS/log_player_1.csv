Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of great value. I'm offering it to you for $18,000.  It's a great price for a product of this caliber.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great price"" and emphasizing the product's value to make it more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond, setting the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation. 

**Important Note:** I'm strategically choosing to start with a higher price, keeping in mind that I can always lower it if Bob rejects my initial offer.  I'm also aware that I have a fallback option with John, which gives me confidence to negotiate aggressively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to sell for a higher amount, accepting his offer ensures I get my minimum value and avoid the risk of a longer negotiation with a possible outcome of getting less."
