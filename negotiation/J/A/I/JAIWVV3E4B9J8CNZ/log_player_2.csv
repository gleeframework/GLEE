"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product that holds great potential.  While I can't disclose all the details, I can assure you it's worth at least $15000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000.  This is a price that reflects its true value while leaving room for you to benefit.  Consider this a chance to secure something truly special.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $12,000.  While she claims the product is worth more to her, that doesn't necessarily mean it's worth that much to you. You have a guaranteed alternative with John at a much lower price."
