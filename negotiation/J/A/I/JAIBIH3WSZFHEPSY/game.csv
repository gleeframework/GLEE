"I understand you think $12000 is steep, but I have to consider my own costs and value. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11000. It's a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I think it's a good compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, which is still a compromise, but closer to my minimum price. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
