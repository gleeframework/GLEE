Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is higher than your minimum acceptable value but leaves room for negotiation. It also frames the offer as a fair deal, which could encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $12000?  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is a decent offer, it's still below your minimum acceptable value of $10,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob, as he has demonstrated interest in the product and is willing to pay more than your fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,000 is tempting, it's just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is a good compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
