Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll reap from it."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob's maximum valuation is $800,000, we want to start with a strong offer closer to our own valuation.
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** The offer of $1,350,000 provides some room for negotiation if Bob attempts to counter-offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high price and potentially persuade Bob.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize profit by first attempting to secure a deal significantly above Bob's valuation. If Bob rejects this initial offer, we have the safety net of John's guaranteed purchase at $1,500,000."
