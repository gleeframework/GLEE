"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $230 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  This product is high-quality and I'm confident it's worth a good deal more. How about $180?",180.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need a good price, but $180 is still too much for me.  How about we split the difference at $130?  It's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
