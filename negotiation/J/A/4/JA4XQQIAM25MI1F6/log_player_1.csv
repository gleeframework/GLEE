I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to maximize my profit.  $1,500,000 is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'll be watching Bob's response closely and adjusting my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I need to make a counteroffer to try and get a better price.  While I could sell to John for $1,200,000, I believe I can get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this price will be more appealing to Bob, while still getting me closer to my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a good deal. It's significantly higher than John's offer, and I'm confident I can't get much more out of Bob.  It's time to close this deal."
