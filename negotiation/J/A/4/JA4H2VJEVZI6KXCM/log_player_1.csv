Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on value:** My message emphasizes the value the product holds for Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I clearly indicate I'm open to negotiation by inviting Bob to respond.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth pursuing further negotiation or if I should sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to consider your product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay that much, but no more. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's not even close to my initial offer of $1,400,000.
* **Potential for better deal:**  There's still a chance to negotiate a higher price with Bob. I can counter with a lower price than my initial offer but still above his offer, hoping to find a compromise. 
* **John's offer:** While John is a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's a chance I can get a better price from Bob by continuing the negotiation. 

**Next step:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price or at least closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a significant discount from my initial price and still represents a great deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $1,400,000 to $1,350,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above minimum:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring I'm not settling for less than what I consider fair. 
* **Focus on the value:** I reiterate the value the product holds for Bob, reminding him of the potential benefit he'll gain from purchasing it.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth pursuing further negotiation or if I should sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're still looking for a higher price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** Even with his counteroffer, Bob's price is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation isn't fruitful:** It seems further negotiation with Bob won't lead to a significantly better price. He's showing resistance to moving higher.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price. 

**Next step:**

It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit with John."
