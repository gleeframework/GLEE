Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get a better price.  $9,000 is closer to my minimum, but I'm confident I can push for a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a little more.  How about $10,000? It's a fair compromise that's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, $9,500 is a good deal considering the value of the product to him and the risk of continuing to negotiate. There's a chance I could get a higher price, but there's also a chance Bob could walk away or I could end up accepting John's offer of $8,000.  $9,500 is a safe bet."
