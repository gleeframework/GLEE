Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. It's a fantastic deal, considering its true value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and encouraging message can make Bob more open to negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Emphasizing the product's value will make Bob more likely to see it as worth the price.

**Plan:**

* If Bob rejects my initial offer, I'll be prepared to counteroffer lower, but still above my minimum of $10,000.
* I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $10,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $7,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's initial counteroffer is unacceptable, it shows he's willing to negotiate.  There's still room for us to find a middle ground.
* **Selling to John is still an option:** I can always fall back on selling to John for $10,000 if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price while still being appealing to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $7,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's true value. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Above Minimum:**  My counteroffer of $8,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. This ensures I don't lose money.
* **Compromise:** I've lowered my price from the initial offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a friendly and optimistic tone helps keep negotiations open. 
* **Value Reminder:**  I'm still reminding Bob about the product's value to encourage him to consider a higher price. 

**Plan:**

* If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll continue to negotiate, but I'll be prepared to lower the price slightly further. 
*  I'll continue to monitor my options and be ready to sell to John for $10,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad we are getting closer.  I can do $7,500, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $7,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, indicating that further negotiation is possible. There's still a chance to reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $10,000 if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a final counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price close to my minimum acceptable price, but leaving room for some potential compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try one more time.  I'm willing to drop to $8,000, but that's my final offer.  It's still a great price for this product, and it's the best I can do.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making this my final counteroffer, indicating I'm serious about this price.
* **Close to Minimum:** $8,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves some room for potential compromise.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm again emphasizing the product's value to make Bob see it's worth the price.
* **Direct Approach:** A clear and direct approach helps avoid further back-and-forth.

**Plan:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John for $10,000, as further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better result."
