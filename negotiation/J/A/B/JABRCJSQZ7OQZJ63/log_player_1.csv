"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth $100 to you, but I'm willing to offer it at $90 for a quick and easy deal."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm willing to pay that price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely he'll come close to $80 in future rounds. It's more profitable to sell to John for a guaranteed $80."
