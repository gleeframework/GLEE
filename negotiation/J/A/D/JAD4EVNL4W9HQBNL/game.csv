"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $650,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. To be frank, I have a hard limit at $700,000.  If you're able to meet that, I think we have a deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint.  However, $700,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $750,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your limits while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",750000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for understanding.  I'm trying to make this work as well. How about we split the difference at $725,000 and call it a deal?",725000.0,Bob,6,
