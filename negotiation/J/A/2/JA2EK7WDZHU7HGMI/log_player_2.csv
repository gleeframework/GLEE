# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer is way too high. It's worth $100 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $180. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid 100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for 140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!

Alice is still asking for more than what the product is worth to Bob. While $140 is a better price than $180, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still a bit too much for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $120? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that 120 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for 130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!

Bob has already made a counteroffer of $120, which Alice rejected. Now Alice is offering $130, which is still more than Bob is willing to pay. Since Bob has a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $100, it's the most logical choice at this point.  It's better to go with John's offer and save some money rather than continue negotiating with Alice."
