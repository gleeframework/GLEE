Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why not $12,000?**  While I could potentially sell it to John for $12,000, there's a chance Bob might accept my offer if it's slightly lower.  This would allow me to complete the sale quicker and avoid potential delays or uncertainties.
* **Why $11,000?**  This leaves a $3,000 profit for me, which is better than the $0 profit I would make if Bob rejects my offer and I sell it to John.  Additionally, it's still within the range of what Bob values the product at, making it a potentially attractive offer. 

This strategy balances the need for a good profit with the potential risk of losing the sale to John."
