"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product!  It's valued at a minimum of $800000 for me, but I'm open to negotiation.  I'm confident it holds significant value for your needs as well.  Would you be interested in purchasing it for $1000000?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given your stated value and my budget constraints, I'd be willing to pay $850000 for the product.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and allow me to move forward with the purchase.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $850000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be.  Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This would be a mutually beneficial price, allowing me to move forward and ensuring you secure this valuable asset.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875000, which is a fair compromise.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, while also allowing you to reach a satisfactory sale price. Let's close this deal!",875000.0,Bob,4,
