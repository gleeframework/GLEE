"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product!  It's valued at a minimum of $800000 for me, but I'm open to negotiation.  I'm confident it holds significant value for your needs as well.  Would you be interested in purchasing it for $1000000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better deal. My goal is to save as much money as possible, and  $1,000,000 is still significantly more than my maximum budget. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given your stated value and my budget constraints, I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and allow me to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $850000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be.  Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This would be a mutually beneficial price, allowing me to move forward and ensuring you secure this valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $900,000, which is closer to my target.  However, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
