Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given your stated value and my budget constraints, I'd be willing to pay $850000 for the product.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and allow me to move forward with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
