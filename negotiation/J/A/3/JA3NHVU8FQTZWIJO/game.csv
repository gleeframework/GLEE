"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget concerns, but I can't go as low as $7,500.  Would you consider $9,000?  This product truly delivers exceptional value.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $8,200. Can we meet at this price?",8200.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. How about we split the difference and call it $8,600? That's my final offer.",8600.0,Alice,5,
