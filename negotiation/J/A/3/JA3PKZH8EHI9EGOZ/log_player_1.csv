I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $110 is below my minimum value, and I'm hoping I can get closer to my initial asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $110 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $125? That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but I'm still not quite there with $117.50.  How about we split the difference and go with $121.25?  It's a fair compromise, and it's closer to what I need to make this worth my while."", ""product_price"": 121.25}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  I've had several rounds of negotiation with Bob, but we're not making much progress and it's getting close to the end.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so it's the best option for me at this point."
