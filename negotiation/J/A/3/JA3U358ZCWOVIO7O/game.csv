"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $15,000 to me, and I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you explaining the product's value to you.  While it sounds great, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget right now. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $9,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it's a great investment.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. I see this product being a valuable asset, and $9,000 is getting closer.  To be honest, $7,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  Would that work for you?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $7,000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer you the product for $8,500. This is a fair price, and I believe you'll find it's a great investment.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been great to work with, and I appreciate your flexibility.  $8,500 is tempting, but I need to stick to my budget. If you'd be willing to come down to $8,000, I'm ready to close the deal right now.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer you the product for $8,250. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you, and I believe you'll find it's a great investment.",8250.0,Alice,7,
