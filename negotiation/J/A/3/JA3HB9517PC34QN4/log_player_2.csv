"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and John is willing to sell the product for $120, which is your maximum budget, it's the best option to buy from John. There's no reason to engage in negotiations with Alice since you can get the same price from John without any risk of getting a higher price."
