Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. This is a great deal considering its true value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer starts by highlighting the value of the product and then presenting a price that is a bit lower than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This approach aims to initiate a conversation and gauge Bob's interest without immediately revealing my bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I want to see if I can push for a better price, so I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with my own."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $12,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $12,750 is closer to my minimum, I've already made two counteroffers, and it seems like Bob is unlikely to budge further.  I've determined that the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection isn't worth it. I'm confident I can secure a much better deal with John, so I'll sell the product to him for $15,000."
