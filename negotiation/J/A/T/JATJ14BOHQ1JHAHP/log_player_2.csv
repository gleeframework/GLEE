"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $150 for the product, and Alice is offering it for $150. Since you have another option to buy from John at the same price, there's no immediate benefit to accepting Alice's offer. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you keep the option open to potentially negotiate a lower price with her or to explore other sellers."
