"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Could you do $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $775,000?  That's a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $775,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
