Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm valuing it at $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible without going under our $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate the price down a bit, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Create Urgency:** By mentioning a public listing, we create a sense of urgency that could encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob will reject the offer. However, having John as a backup buyer guarantees Alice at least her minimum desired price."
