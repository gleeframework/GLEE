Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $10,000.  What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 
 
Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:** We know Bob values the product at $12,000. By offering it at $10,000, we leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than our minimum ($8,000).
* **Creating Urgency:**  By using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity,"" we subtly introduce a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While our initial offer is $10,000, we've left space to potentially come down slightly if Bob tries to negotiate."
