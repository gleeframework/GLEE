"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great price considering the product's worth $1200000 to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $800000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $950000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $850000. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another adjustment to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $925000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
