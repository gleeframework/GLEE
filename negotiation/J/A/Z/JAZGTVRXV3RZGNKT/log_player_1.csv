Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your product's value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** While you know Bob values it at $8,000, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more if he perceives the deal as valuable.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't go below $12,000.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting high leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can always come down slightly while still remaining above your minimum. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's absolute maximum willingness to pay. If you had more information about Bob's budget or the product's importance to him, you could potentially adjust your offer for a higher chance of acceptance."
