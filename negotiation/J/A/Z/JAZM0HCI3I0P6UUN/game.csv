,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $90? That's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about $85? I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. $85 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $87? This is my final offer.",87.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $87 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $82.50. I'm trying to stay within my budget.",82.5,Bob,6,
