"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This is a strong opening offer. It's above the product's value to Bob, but not excessively so.  It leaves room for negotiation while still showing you're serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your desired price and even lower than the guaranteed $800,000 from John. It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price with Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth significantly more to you, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about $850,000? That leaves room for both of us to be happy."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?  That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $725,000 is closer to your desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still below the guaranteed $800,000 from John. There's still room for negotiation, and you can try to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $725,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of the product to you.  I'm willing to go down to $775,000.  That's a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 775000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. That's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product is worth it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a good offer and is getting close to your desired price, it's still less than what John is offering. There are a few rounds left, and it's worth seeing if you can squeeze a bit more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is still a bit too low.  Given the product's value to you and the progress we've made, I'm willing to come down to $765,000. This offer is fair and gives us both a good outcome."", ""product_price"": 765000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a critical point in our negotiation. I'm prepared to offer $755,000. This is my final offer, as going any higher would make it difficult to justify the investment.  Let me know your decision. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $755,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $755,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer of $755,000 is still lower than what John is offering.  With only two rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is high.  It's more secure to sell to John for the guaranteed $800,000."
