Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial offer:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). This creates room for negotiation and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not aiming to get my full asking price immediately, as that would likely lead to a quick rejection. By offering a lower price initially, I increase the chance of Bob accepting or engaging in further negotiation.
* **Always considering John's offer:**  It's crucial to remember John's offer of $1,200,000. This acts as a safety net, ensuring I don't settle for too low a price. If Bob rejects my initial offer and subsequent negotiations don't lead to a satisfactory outcome, I can always fall back on John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Can we meet in the middle at $800000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $800,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I need to get for the product. Accepting this offer would mean sacrificing a significant portion of the value.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** I'm not willing to settle for $800,000 yet.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter-offer and explore other options. I can still potentially negotiate a higher price, ideally closer to my desired range.
* **John's offer is still a safety net:**  If the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory outcome, I can always turn to John and secure a guaranteed $1,200,000.

**Next steps:**

* I will formulate a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price higher than $800,000 but lower than my initial offer of $1,000,000. This will demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining my desired profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still represents a great deal for you, and it's a price I can reasonably accept. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, showing flexibility while still protecting my interests. It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial proposal. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate without completely giving in.
* **Maintaining value:** $900,000 is still a significant profit for me, keeping me closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Encouraging acceptance:** The message highlights the value proposition for Bob and expresses a desire to finalize the deal.  

**Next steps:** 

* If Bob accepts, I will finalize the transaction.
* If Bob rejects, I will analyze his response and decide whether to make another counteroffer or turn to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $700000. Can we discuss this further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would result in a major loss for me. 
* **Negotiation isn't moving in the right direction:** Bob's counteroffers are becoming increasingly unreasonable. It seems he's not willing to budge much, and accepting his offer at this point would set a bad precedent for future negotiations.
* **John's offer is the safest option:** Since I'm unlikely to get a better price from Bob, selling to John for $1,200,000 is the most logical choice. It guarantees my minimum acceptable price and minimizes the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

**Next steps:**

* I will immediately contact John and accept his offer to sell the product for $1,200,000. This ensures I secure the best possible price and avoid potentially losing money by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too far below my minimum price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, at $800,000. This represents a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing this."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final attempt:** I'm making one last counteroffer, aiming for a compromise to see if we can reach an agreement. 
* **Meeting halfway:**  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while staying close to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Clarity and finality:**  The message clearly states my final offer and emphasizes the need for a decision.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I will finalize the transaction. 
* If Bob rejects, I will immediately contact John and accept his offer of $1,200,000, ending the negotiation with Bob."
