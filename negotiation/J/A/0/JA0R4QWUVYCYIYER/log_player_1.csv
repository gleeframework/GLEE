Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you.  Let's start with a price of $1,750,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but also reflects the product's true worth."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that starting price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better price. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering the product for $1,600,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $1,350,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable accepting. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'll need to see a more substantial increase from Bob.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,350,000 is still too low for me.  Let's aim for a compromise that works for both of us. I'm offering the product for $1,450,000. This price is a fair reflection of the product's value and leaves room for further discussion."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting closer.  I could meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would $1,400,000 work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is close enough to my minimum that I'm willing to accept. This ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John at a lower price."
