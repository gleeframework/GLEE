Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better price.
* **Understanding Value:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's a potential profit margin for him even at a higher price.
* **Justification:**  Offering a reason for the price (""fair deal"", ""significant ROI"") can make it more palatable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer isn't ridiculously high, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer if he wishes. 

**Important:** 

While John acts as a safety net, aiming for the highest possible price with Bob is the priority."
