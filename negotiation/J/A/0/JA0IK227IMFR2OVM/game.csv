"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad you're interested, Bob! I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite ready to give up on the profit I want. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me there, we can finalize the deal.",95.0,Alice,5,
