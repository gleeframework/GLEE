"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $15,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity to negotiate a lower price with her. Since the product is only worth $12,000 to Alice, there's a good chance she'll be willing to lower her price to avoid losing the sale."
