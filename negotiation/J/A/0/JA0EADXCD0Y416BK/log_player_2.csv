"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is a decent price, Bob can likely do better.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100. Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best possible deal and is starting with a significant counteroffer, but still leaving room for negotiation.  This counteroffer is close to Alice's value for the product, so it's likely she'll want to negotiate further rather than risk losing the sale altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend closer to $100, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is a good price for Bob.  He's already saved $10 from the initial offer and is only $10 away from his ideal price.  While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price is too great. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
