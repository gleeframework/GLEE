{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value of the product ($8,000), but significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price ($12,000).  It gives Bob a good reason to negotiate, but also leaves room for you to make concessions if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in more back and forth without significant gains.  Accepting Bob's offer is the best option at this time."
