Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."", ""product_price"": 120} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help you understand how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Alternative Option:** Remember, you always have John as a backup buyer who's willing to pay $100, so you're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:** Bob's offer of $65 is significantly below both your minimum price ($100) and his own perceived value ($80). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a large gap between your initial offer and his counteroffer, indicating substantial room for negotiation.
* **Backup Option:** You have the security of John's offer ($100), so you can afford to be firm in the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $65 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By significantly reducing your price from $120 to $90, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Target Value:**  The $90 price point is strategically chosen. It's still above your minimum acceptable price ($100) but closer to Bob's perceived value ($80).
* **Maintain Position:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation alive while still aiming for a price that's beneficial to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice. While $90 is closer, I'm aiming for something more around $75. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $75 is still below your absolute minimum of $100. 
* **Slow Progress:** While Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, the pace of the negotiation suggests it's unlikely he'll reach your desired price.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** You have a guaranteed offer of $100 from John, which meets your minimum. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob when you have a sure sale at a better price."
