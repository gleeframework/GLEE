"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $10,500?  This is still a good deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  $10,500 is still a little high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,125. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to come to an agreement. Let me know what you think.",10125.0,Alice,5,
