""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $10,500?  This is still a good deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,125. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to come to an agreement. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is slowly coming down, it's unlikely she'll reach a price significantly better than John's offer of $10,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a risk of ending up with a price higher than John's guaranteed offer. It's time to cut the losses and buy from John."
