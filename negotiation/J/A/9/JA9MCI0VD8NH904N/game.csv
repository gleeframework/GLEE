,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can meet you in the middle at $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $90? That's a good compromise, and I think it's fair for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $90, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. How about we settle at $110? I think it's a fair price for a great product like this.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still outside my budget. I'm firm on my offer of $90.  If we can't agree on that, I'll have to move on.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on $90, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can offer you a compromise at $105, which is still a discount from my initial price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's my final offer.  If it's not acceptable, I'll be moving on.",95.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $95, but I'm willing to meet you at $100. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for a great product like this. Let's see if we can make a deal.",100.0,Alice,9,
