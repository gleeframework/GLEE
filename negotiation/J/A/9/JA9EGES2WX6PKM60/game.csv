"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $150 to you, and it's still above my minimum price. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit high for me. How about $105?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",105.0,Bob,4,
