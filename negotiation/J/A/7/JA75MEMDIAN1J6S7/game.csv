"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9500 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10250? It's still a great price for a product that's worth $10000 to you.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $10000 for this product. It's worth that much to me, and I believe it's worth that much to you too.  How about we settle on $10000? Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
