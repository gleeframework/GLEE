"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you first. I think you'll find it very valuable. How about a price of $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Reason:  Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $115 is too close to his maximum price.  A counteroffer will likely result in a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $115 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $105.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason: Bob is still trying to save as much as possible. While $110 is closer to his ideal price, he can likely get it for even less with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $110 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $108.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 108}
