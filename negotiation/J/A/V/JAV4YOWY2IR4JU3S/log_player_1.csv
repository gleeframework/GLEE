Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

We are getting close, but we can still try to get more from Bob before accepting his offer or going to John."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

While we could try to push Bob a little further, his latest message suggests he's nearing his limit. Accepting his offer of $1,500,000 makes the most sense at this point. This price matches what John is offering, and avoids the risk of Bob walking away and needing to start over with a new buyer."
