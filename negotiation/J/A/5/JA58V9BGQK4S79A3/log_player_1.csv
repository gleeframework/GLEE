Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a good compromise between my minimum acceptable price and the perceived value for Bob. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a decent profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $12,000 for it. I hope this revised offer works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

I'm still aiming for a higher price than Bob's current offer.  I'm going to see if I can push for a slightly better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $12,400. It's a small difference, but I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 12400}
