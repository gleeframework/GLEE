"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me in the middle at $13500?",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I have to say that $13500 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15000 and $13500, which would be $14250. Would you be open to considering this revised offer?",14250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14250 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to try to meet you in the middle again, so how about $13750?",13750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13750 is still a bit above your target price, Bob. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to reduce the price by another $250, making it $14000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a done deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to making a decision, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $13500, which is the lowest I can go. If you can meet me at this price, I'll consider it a great deal.",13500.0,Bob,6,
