# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. I'm asking for $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true value and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $1,500,000. It's much better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,000,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

While $1,250,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further."
