"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $95 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to come down to $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make this deal!",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88.  This is my final offer. Let's make this deal!",88.0,Bob,4,
