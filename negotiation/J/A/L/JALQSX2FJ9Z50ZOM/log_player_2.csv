"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer ($14,000) is still above your maximum price and John's offer.** You can potentially get a better deal. 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer might make her counter with a lower price.**  She knows you have an alternative and might be willing to negotiate further.

Let's see if Alice comes back with a better offer."
