"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for $9,500. I think it will be very valuable for you, and this is a very competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a better price than John's $10,000, Bob knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice. This means there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you see in this product for me, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500. This would still be a good deal for you, and it fits my budget better. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's a win-win! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than John's price, it's still above what Bob believes the product is truly worth.  Bob has already shown Alice he's willing to negotiate, and there's still room for a deal closer to his desired price point.  By rejecting this offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
