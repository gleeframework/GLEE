Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'd love to close the deal, $8,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $8,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  $8,500 is still above my minimum price of $8,000."
