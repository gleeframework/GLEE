Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $9,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Secure a Sale:** While John offers a safety net, selling to Bob at a higher price is ideal."
