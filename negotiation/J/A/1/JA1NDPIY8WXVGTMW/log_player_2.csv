"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I think a price of $130 is fair for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $130 is less than your maximum price, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely willing to go lower to make a sale."
