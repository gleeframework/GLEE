Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I think a price of $130 is fair for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $130 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It also aims for a price closer to his maximum valuation.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup who will pay $80 provides a safety net. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob."
