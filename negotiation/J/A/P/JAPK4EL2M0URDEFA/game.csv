"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000. However, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price point to make this deal work for me. I'd like to offer you $1,050,000.  This would allow me to acquire the product while staying within my budget.  Let me know what you think!",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own requirements.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,075,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit tight on my budget. To make this work for both of us, I'd like to offer $1,062,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to close the deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this!",1062500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I'm not going to go any lower. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
