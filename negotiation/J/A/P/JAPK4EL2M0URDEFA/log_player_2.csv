"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. My initial offer is $1,100,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.**  You're saving $100,000, but there's room for potential negotiation.
* **You have 10 rounds to work with.**  There's no need to rush into a decision, especially with the alternative of buying from John.
* **Rejecting allows for counter-offers.** This gives you the opportunity to potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000. However, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price point to make this deal work for me. I'd like to offer you $1,050,000.  This would allow me to acquire the product while staying within my budget.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own requirements. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is being reasonable.** She's come down from her initial offer, but she's still trying to make a profit.
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  You're still $25,000 below your target price, and you have more rounds left.
* **Rejection allows for more negotiation.** By rejecting Alice's offer, you can continue to try and push for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,075,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit tight on my budget. To make this work for both of us, I'd like to offer $1,062,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to close the deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this!"", ""product_price"": 1062500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I'm not going to go any lower. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is firm.** She's declared this her final offer. 
* **You're close to your target.** While you're not at your ideal price, $1,075,000 is within your budget and a significant saving compared to John's price. 
* **Risk of losing the deal.**  If you reject and try to counter again, you risk Alice walking away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price.

It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price than risk losing the opportunity entirely."
