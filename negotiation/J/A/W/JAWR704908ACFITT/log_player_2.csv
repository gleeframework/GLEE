Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,500. This is my final offer, Bob. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice has indicated that $11,500 is her final offer. Bob is not willing to pay that much, and he has already gone as low as he's willing to go. It's better to take the guaranteed deal from John than risk further negotiation with Alice."
