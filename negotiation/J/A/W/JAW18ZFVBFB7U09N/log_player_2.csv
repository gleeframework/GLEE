"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your maximum budget and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I had in mind. This product holds significant value to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. Would you consider $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We start with a strong counter-offer significantly below Alice's asking price but still leaving room for negotiation. This approach helps gauge Alice's willingness to move on price and establishes our budget limitations early on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you and my initial asking price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to a more reasonable price, but it's still above your fallback option with John. You have room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $900,000 is closer to what I envisioned, it's still a significant investment for me. To make this work, I can offer you $700,000. I believe this reflects the product's value while respecting my budget."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're making a smaller counter-offer, moving closer to Alice's price but staying firmly below our $800,000 limit. This approach signals seriousness while maintaining pressure for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my initial asking price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting very close to your limit, but you're still $50,000 away from your best alternative. It's worth pushing for a final concession before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be completely transparent, I have an alternative offer for $800,000. I'd much prefer to work with you, but I need us to meet at that price point. Would you be willing to reconsider?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  In this round, we're putting our cards on the table. By revealing John's offer, we're creating a sense of urgency and showing Alice that this is our firm limit. We're also emphasizing our preference to close the deal with her, which might encourage her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value and our previous negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice has made it clear that $825,000 is her bottom line. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $800,000, it makes more financial sense to take the better deal.  Continuing negotiations at this point is unlikely to result in a better price from Alice."
