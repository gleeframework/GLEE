"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe you'd find very useful. I'm open to negotiation, but my starting price is $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Room for Compromise:**  The price is below my minimum value, allowing me to make concessions if needed.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm starting with a friendly and open tone to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $9,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value:** Even though Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still not high enough.
* **I want to explore further negotiation:** I believe I can likely get a better price from Bob if I continue to negotiate.
* **I have time to negotiate:**  I have 8 rounds left and can afford to reject this offer and see if Bob will improve his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a significant compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable decrease:** I'm lowering my price from $12,000 to $10,500, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm emphasizing the compromise and hoping to reach an agreement, keeping the conversation friendly.
* **Stay above my minimum value:** $10,500 is still higher than my minimum of $15,000, ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is getting closer:** While Bob's offer is higher than before, it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  
* **More room for negotiation:**  I believe there's still potential to get a better price from Bob.
* **Time is on my side:** I have 6 rounds left and can afford to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $10,000 is closer, but I'm still not there yet. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $10,250?  This way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's current offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise further.
* **Highlighting the 'good deal':** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $10,250 is still above my minimum value, allowing me to make a profit while potentially closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've reviewed your latest offer and appreciate your effort to meet in the middle. I would like to counter with a price of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob is refusing to budge beyond $10,000, and I'm unlikely to get a better offer from him.
* **Time is Limited:** We are halfway through the negotiation rounds, and I'm not confident we'll reach an agreement that meets my minimum value.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer.

It's better to secure a guaranteed profit than to risk further negotiation with Bob, which could result in a lower price or a failure to reach an agreement altogether."
