"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that's beneficial for both of us.  I'm also mindful of the $8,000 backup offer from John, so I'm not risking too much by starting high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it's appealing enough for him to accept. I'm still confident that I can get a better price than $8,000, but I'm also not trying to push him away completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further in the next round.  I'm also mindful that John is willing to pay $8,000, so I'm not risking too much by holding out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500.  I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still trying to get a bit more. This is a significant compromise, and I'm hopeful Bob will see it as a fair price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob and I are not seeing eye-to-eye on the price, and I'm running out of rounds. Rather than risk a further stalemate and possibly end up with nothing, I'm going to accept the offer from John. It's a safe bet that will ensure I at least make my minimum goal."
