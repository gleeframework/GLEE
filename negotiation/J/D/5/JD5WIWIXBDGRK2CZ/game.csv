"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  This price reflects a fair value for both of us and allows for a successful transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $900,000 is closer to our goals.  However, considering the product's unique capabilities and the value it brings to your operations, I believe a price of $950,000  would be a fair reflection.  This price allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,
