"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 18000} 
 
I'm starting high, aiming for the best possible price. I'll see if Bob bites, and adjust my strategy based on his reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $8,000 is way too low, and I'm not willing to settle for that. I'll counteroffer and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a good profit.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can do better. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a decent profit margin.  I'm hoping this shows him my willingness to compromise, and leads to a deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum, but I've already gone through 5 rounds of negotiation.  I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better price from Bob, and I don't want to risk running out of time. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and allows me to close the deal quickly."
