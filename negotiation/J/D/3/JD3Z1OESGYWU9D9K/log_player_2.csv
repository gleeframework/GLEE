You can do better than $130. Let's try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $122.50? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price.

Let's see if we can get a little closer to my target price. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm not ready to pay $122.50."
