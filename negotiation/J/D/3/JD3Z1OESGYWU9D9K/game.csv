"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $115 for it. What do you think?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $122.50? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price.",122.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's try $118.  It's closer to your last offer, and it would be a good deal for both of us.",118.0,Bob,4,
