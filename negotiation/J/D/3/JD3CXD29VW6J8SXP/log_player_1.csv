"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $22,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite low for the value this product delivers.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen!

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be closer to my original asking price to make this work.  Would you consider $16,000? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to be close to your asking price, but $16,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair compromise and closer to my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

It's not worth the risk of Bob's offer going lower or the negotiations failing.  I'll take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
