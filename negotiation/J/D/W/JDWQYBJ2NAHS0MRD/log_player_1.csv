Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for a Deal:** $900,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $800,000. This gives him an incentive to negotiate.
* **Protecting My Minimum:**  This offer is above my minimum value of $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose out on a significant profit.
* **Setting the Stage:**  My message is positive and inviting, emphasizing the value of the product. This creates a more collaborative negotiation atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is close to his perceived value, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Opportunity for a Better Deal:**  I believe there is still room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, potentially securing a higher price. 
* **John is a Backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage to be more assertive in the negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $880,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 880000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with a Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows I am willing to negotiate and potentially reach a deal.
* **Maintain My Minimum:**  $880,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose out on a significant profit.
* **Positive and Motivational Message:** My message is still friendly and encouraging, emphasizing a fair deal for both of us. This helps keep the negotiation positive and allows Bob to see the potential benefits of accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $880,000 is closer, I'm still a bit above my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $860,000? This would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  While Bob's offer of $860,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it is still below it.
* **Risk of Continued Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, potentially jeopardizing my minimum acceptable profit.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me my minimum price and a secure profit. This eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

I'm choosing to sell to John because the potential gain from further negotiation with Bob is not worth the risk of potentially ending up with a price lower than my minimum.  John provides a guaranteed and secure profit, making him the better choice in this situation."
