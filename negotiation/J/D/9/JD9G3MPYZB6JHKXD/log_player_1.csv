"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Value proposition:** I'm hinting at the product's value to Bob without revealing my true minimum price. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Test Bob's willingness to pay:**  If he accepts, I've achieved a good price.
* **Set the stage for negotiation:** If he rejects, it gives me information to adjust my strategy in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $100 I need to get.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation and I might be able to get a price closer to my target.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John guarantees $100, but I'm willing to take a chance on potentially getting a higher price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, but still leaving some room for compromise. I'll aim for a price between $95 and $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point.  I can come down to $95.  This is still a good deal for both of us, as the product is truly valuable.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** My counteroffer of $95 falls between my minimum acceptable price ($100) and Bob's offer ($90).
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify my counteroffer.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly to encourage further negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

By offering $95, I'm demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my goal. This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward and increases the likelihood of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  Bob's offer of $85 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a risk that continued negotiation with Bob might lead to even lower offers, and I could end up with a price I'm not comfortable with.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me $100, which is a safe and reliable option.

**Conclusion:**

While I'd prefer to get a higher price,  the risk of further negotiation with Bob is not worth it.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $100 from John and avoid the possibility of a deal that doesn't meet my minimum requirements."
