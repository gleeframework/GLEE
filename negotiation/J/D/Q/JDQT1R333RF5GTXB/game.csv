"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your time and consideration. However, I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,200,000 is certainly a significant sum, I believe the true value of this product and its potential benefits warrant a higher price point.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000.  This offer reflects my desire to find a fair agreement. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
