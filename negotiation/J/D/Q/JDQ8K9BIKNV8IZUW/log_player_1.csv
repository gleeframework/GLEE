Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One Shot:** You only get one chance to make an offer to Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little incentive for Bob. Aim for a price that gives both of you a good deal.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair for both of us.  This offer stands until [set a reasonable deadline], after which I'll be moving forward with other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Clear and Confident:** The message is direct and highlights the product's value.
* **Strong Price:** $1,150,000 gives you a $150,000 profit over your guarantee and saves Bob $50,000.
* **Deadline:** Creates urgency and prevents Bob from stalling.

**Important Considerations**

* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might consider a slightly lower price. 
* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start with a slightly higher price to allow room for negotiation.
