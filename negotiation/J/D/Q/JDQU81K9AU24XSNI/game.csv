"I appreciate your offer, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer,  $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider.  Let's find some common ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and it reflects my desire to work with you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Can we try $1,050,000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,050,000 is simply not a price I can accept. To make this deal work, I need to be closer to $1,200,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1,150,000. This is my final offer.  Let's close this deal and both walk away happy.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm afraid $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $1,075,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll make the deal happen. This is my last offer.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
