Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more than that to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by aiming for a price close to the middle ground between your minimum ($8,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.  

This approach balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential to get a good price. If Bob rejects, we can analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly, always keeping in mind the fallback option of selling to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $7,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. It's not worth selling the product at a loss. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $8,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. How about $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my acceptable threshold of $8,000.  I'll reject this offer and counter with a price that gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  To move forward, I'm willing to go down to $8,200. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 8200}
