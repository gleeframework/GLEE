"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $8,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. How about $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  To move forward, I'm willing to go down to $8,200. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!",8200.0,Alice,5,
