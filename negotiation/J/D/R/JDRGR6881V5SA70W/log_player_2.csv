Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about $1,200,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate you moving in my direction.  To be frank, I have a hard limit at $1,150,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.  If you're serious, I believe this is a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate down, but her ""hard limit"" of $1,150,000 is still above your maximum budget and what John offers.  There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, and continuing the negotiation risks missing out on John's guaranteed offer.  You're better off taking the sure thing and saving $150,000."
