"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,600,000."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" of the product, justifying the high initial price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By starting high, I aim to anchor the negotiation around a higher number, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome even with concessions.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to walk away and sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. I believe there is room for negotiation, so I will reject his offer and prepare a counteroffer for Round 3."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about $1,200,000?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate by meeting Bob halfway between his low offer ($800,000) and my initial high offer ($1,600,000). This lands us directly at my minimum acceptable price.
* **Firm but Fair:** While the message acknowledges Bob's perspective, it firmly reiterates the product's value. I'm setting a clear boundary that I'm not willing to go below $1,200,000.
* **Time Consideration:** We're still in the early rounds, but I'm moving towards a more reasonable price point to encourage a deal while keeping my bottom line in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that's still a bit too rich for my blood. How about we split the difference between our last two offers? I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now at his perceived value for the product, but I'm still below my minimum. While it's tempting to accept, I believe there's still a chance to negotiate a price closer to $1,200,000. I'm willing to push a bit further since I have the security of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate you moving in my direction.  To be frank, I have a hard limit at $1,150,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.  If you're serious, I believe this is a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with a Limit:**  I'm making another concession, but this time a smaller one ($50,000). This shows continued willingness to negotiate but also establishes a firm boundary just above my absolute minimum.
* **Transparency and Urgency:** I'm being transparent about my ""hard limit"" to signal the seriousness of the offer and encourage Bob to act. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message reiterates the product's value to justify the price and prevent Bob from anchoring too low.
* **Calculated Risk:**  While I'm slightly below my ideal price, I'm weighing the risk of losing the deal against the potential gain of securing a sale quickly."
