"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate you moving in my direction.  To be frank, I have a hard limit at $1,150,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.  If you're serious, I believe this is a fair offer.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
