"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see in it, but also ensures a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,250,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
