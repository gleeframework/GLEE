Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit outside your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $975,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me and your needs. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $975,000 is still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to consider your offer of $900,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'll make a counteroffer of $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your needs. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  While $925,000 is still above your ideal price, it's close enough to your maximum budget that it's worth accepting.  Further negotiation might get you a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and you'll be forced to buy from John at $800,000.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a price that's still within your budget."
