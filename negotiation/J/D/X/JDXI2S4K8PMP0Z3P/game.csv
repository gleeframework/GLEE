"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,700,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has tremendous potential and I've had significant interest in it. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This reflects the product's true value while still offering you a good deal.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,850,000, which I believe represents a fair compromise.  Let's bridge this gap and reach an agreement.",1850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see we're getting closer, I'm looking for a price closer to $1,950,000. I believe this fairly reflects the product's value and the potential return on investment you'll gain.",1950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's aim for a final compromise. I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000, which reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round.",1900000.0,Bob,6,
