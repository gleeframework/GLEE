"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would still give you a significant value for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
