"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8,500? This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $7,250 is still a bit too low for me. Let's aim for a price closer to the middle ground. How about $8,000? This would still give you a significant savings and is closer to what I need for the product.",8000.0,Alice,5,
