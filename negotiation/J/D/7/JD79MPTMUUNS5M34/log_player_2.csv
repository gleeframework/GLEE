Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not willing to go as low as $75, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $85. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.

It's not worth trying to negotiate further. Alice seems unlikely to go below $85, and you can get the product for $80 from John."
