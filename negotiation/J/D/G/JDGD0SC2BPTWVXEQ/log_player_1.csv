Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. It's a bit higher than my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I'm also leaving room to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my ideal price. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $95. It's a compromise, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping this will be enough to persuade Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's only slightly above my minimum price, it's still better than selling to John.  This round has shown me that Bob is willing to negotiate, so I'd rather make a deal with him than risk losing him altogether."
