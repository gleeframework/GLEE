"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be a perfect fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This gives you a significant discount, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's close this deal now.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
