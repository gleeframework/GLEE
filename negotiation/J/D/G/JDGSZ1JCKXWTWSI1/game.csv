"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $20,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price.",18000.0,Alice,3,
