"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $130. I think it's a great deal for you, given its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good deal compared to John's $150, you can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  There's room for both of you to find a price that's mutually beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to pay $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price. At $125, you're getting a good deal while still leaving Alice a profit margin. Accepting this offer saves you $25 compared to buying from John, and it's a win-win situation for both of you."
