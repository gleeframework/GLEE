Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the effort, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I would like to propose a price of $8,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price, so I will reject it and try to negotiate a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750?  This allows me to make a fair profit while still offering you a competitive price."", ""product_price"": 8750}
