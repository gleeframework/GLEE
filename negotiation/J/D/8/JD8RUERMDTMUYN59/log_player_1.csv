"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a bold opening move, but it allows me to maximize potential profits. It's likely Bob will counteroffer, giving us room to negotiate. 

I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $8,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails, so I'm not afraid to push for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $9,000. While it's close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $10,000. I'm not ready to settle for $9,000 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm countering with $9,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway, but still giving me a profit margin. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving in too quickly. I hope Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $8,500. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, I'm not ready to settle yet. I still believe there's potential to get a higher price, especially since we have more rounds of negotiation left. 

I'm also considering that if I reject this offer, I can always sell to John for $8,000, so I'm not feeling pressured to accept a price that I'm not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm countering with $9,000. This is another compromise, closer to Bob's last offer but still above my minimum.  I believe this demonstrates my willingness to reach an agreement while maintaining a reasonable profit margin.  We're getting close to a deal, and I want to see if Bob is willing to bridge the gap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling the product to John for $8,000. Bob's offer of $7,800 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  With only a few rounds left, I don't want to risk continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoids further risk."
