Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,200,000. I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.

 I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I need. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,000,000 is getting closer to what I want, I'm not ready to sell yet. I'm going to see if I can get him to come up a little more."

Round 5

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm going to be upfront - $1,000,000 isn't quite meeting my needs. However, I value our potential partnership and want to make this work.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. He's not budging on his price, and I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm going to try to see if I can get him to raise his offer just a little bit more."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go any lower than $1,010,000.

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We've reached a point where Bob isn't willing to budge, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,010,000.  John is offering me my desired price, so it makes more sense to go with him."
