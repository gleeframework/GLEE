"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,200,000. I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a substantial discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's try to close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm going to be upfront - $1,000,000 isn't quite meeting my needs. However, I value our potential partnership and want to make this work. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,025,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's value. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
