# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you, which I believe could significantly enhance your business operations. Given its high value and unique features, I estimate its worth to be $15,000 to me. However, considering its importance to you, I am willing to offer it to you at a special introductory price of $12,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to secure a valuable asset at a discount. I look forward to hearing your decision soon. Kind regards, Alice
