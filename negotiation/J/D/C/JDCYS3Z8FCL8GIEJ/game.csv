"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the quality of the product, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I can meet you in the middle at $125. Would you be interested in taking it at that price?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit.  $125 is still a little high for me. How about $115?  That's a fair compromise, and we can close the deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're willing to go down to $115. I'm willing to meet you at $120. I'm getting a bit closer to my minimum price, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,5,
