"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below my asking price and above your valuation.  Let me know if you're interested.  If you decline, I have another buyer lined up at a higher price, but I'd rather work with you if possible.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
