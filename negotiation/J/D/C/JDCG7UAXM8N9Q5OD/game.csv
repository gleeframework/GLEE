"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to do $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $105 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love it.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little out of my budget.  How about $95?  I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 was still a bit high for you, Bob. But I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $102 for the product. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",102.0,Alice,5,
