Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a high price of $1,400,000. This is still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to emphasize the potential benefit for Bob. I'm also keeping the tone friendly and encouraging. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I aim to maximize my profit. If Bob rejects my initial offer, I'll be prepared to counter, but I'll also be mindful of the ""John"" option, which provides a safety net of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price closer to $1200000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.  

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my target. This allows me to explore if there's room for further negotiation while keeping the possibility of selling to John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product, but it also shows my willingness to work with you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm countering with $1,300,000. This is a compromise that's closer to my target price, but still allows for further negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while highlighting the value of the product. I'm also emphasizing my willingness to negotiate, which could encourage Bob to meet me halfway.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while ensuring that I stay within a range that's comfortable for me.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll re-evaluate my options, including potentially selling to John if I feel like I'm not going to get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above your new offer. Can we meet in the middle at $1250000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is now within my acceptable range.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's important to remember that:

* **My minimum goal is $1,000,000.**  This offer exceeds that.
* **Further negotiation could lead to a stalemate.**  There's a risk that continued back-and-forth could result in Bob walking away, leaving me with no sale.
* **Time is a factor.**  Each round of negotiation takes time, and I need to consider the opportunity cost of potentially losing a sale. 

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer at $1,250,000 ensures a quick and profitable sale. It's a good compromise that balances my need for a high price with the risk of losing the deal."
