Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000, knowing the product is worth $15,000 to Bob. This leaves some room for negotiation while still securing a profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,000 is a good offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $17,000, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob. This shows flexibility while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer of $16,500 is a good compromise and gets me closer to my desired price. I'll accept his offer to avoid further negotiation and potential risk of losing the deal."
