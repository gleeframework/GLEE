I'm going to try and get a better price from Alice.  $90 is over my budget, and I'm confident I can get it closer to my $80 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $75. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within a reasonable range for both of us.  I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to start negotiating seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

Alice is still a bit high.  I'm going to reject her offer and try to get closer to my target price of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}

I'm going to make a final counteroffer of $80. This is my absolute maximum, and I'm hoping Alice will realize that it's in her best interest to close the deal. If she rejects, I'll go to John."
