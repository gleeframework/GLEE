"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. While it's tempting to accept because it's still below the product's value to Alice, I have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and it leaves some room for both of us to profit."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise that still leaves some room for both of us to profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get a better deal. There are still several rounds left, and I want to see if I can push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. Considering the value to me and the potential for both of us to make a profit, I'm ready to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair and reasonable price that bridges the gap between our offers."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,300,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,315,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,315,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,315,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,315,000 is within my budget and is closer to the price I'm comfortable with. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise, or I might not get a better offer in the remaining rounds. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product without exceeding my budget."
