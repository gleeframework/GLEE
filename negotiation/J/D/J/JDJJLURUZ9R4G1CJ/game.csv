"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and it leaves some room for both of us to profit.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise that still leaves some room for both of us to profit. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. Considering the value to me and the potential for both of us to make a profit, I'm ready to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair and reasonable price that bridges the gap between our offers.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,300,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,315,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1315000.0,Alice,5,
