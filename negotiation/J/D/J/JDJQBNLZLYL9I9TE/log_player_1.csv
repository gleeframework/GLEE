"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since the product is worth $10,000 to me, I'm hoping to get a little extra. I know Bob values the product at $8,000, so this is a significant price difference. Let's see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is a decent price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to see if I can negotiate further with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer. I hope this will be a good compromise that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it yet.  I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price before accepting or switching to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer $10,000.  This is my minimum price, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and accept my offer."
