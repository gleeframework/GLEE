# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price of $1,600,000.  It's a significant asset that I believe will be of great benefit to you.  While I'm confident I can find another buyer at the market value of $1,500,000, I'm willing to offer you a slight premium for your prompt decision.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget and John's offer. It makes the most financial sense to buy from John at the lower price."
