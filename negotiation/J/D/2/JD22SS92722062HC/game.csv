"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and giving you a good profit margin. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $850,000 is certainly a fair price, I believe this product's true value sits higher.  Would you be willing to meet me at $900,000? This allows me to recognize its worth while still providing you a significant return on your investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This shows my commitment to making a deal, but it's also fair considering the product's value to me. Let's work together to finalize this.",875000.0,Bob,4,
