``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

* **Reasoning:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get Bob to increase his offer. 
* **Next Steps:**  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget. While $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to be flexible.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offering:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my desired price. I want to see if I can get him to increase his offer just a bit more.
* **Reasoning:**  I believe there's still potential to negotiate a price that's more favorable for me.
* **Next Steps:**  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the remaining gap.  However, I'm aware that my time is limited and I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John might be the better option."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm trying to be as flexible as possible.  $9,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $9,100.  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product highly valuable.  Let me know if you can accept this final offer."", ""product_price"": 9100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offering:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, but still within my acceptable range. 
* **Finality:**  I'm phrasing this as a ""final offer"" to add a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize the benefits of the deal.

**Reasoning:**

* I'm approaching the point where selling to John might be a better choice, so I'm pushing for a decision from Bob. 
* I've narrowed the gap significantly, and I'm hoping that Bob will accept this compromise. 
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Selling to John:** Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price, and I've only got a few rounds left.  I'm not confident I can get Bob to budge much further. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price of $12,000, which is significantly more than what Bob is currently offering.  
* **Risk Mitigation:** By selling to John, I eliminate the risk of further negotiations with Bob failing, and I also avoid the possibility of losing the deal completely."
