Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, allowing room for negotiation while still ensuring I get more than my minimum value of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $180. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
```

I'm counteroffering at $190. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground and close the deal."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $170.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $170.  While it's lower than I initially hoped for, it's still above my minimum value of $150. With only 6 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
