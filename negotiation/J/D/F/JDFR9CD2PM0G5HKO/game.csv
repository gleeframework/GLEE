"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $10,800. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $9,500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $10,200. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,200 is still a bit above my budget.  How about we split the difference and call it $9,850?  That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",9850.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,850. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $10,100. This is as close to your offer as I'm willing to go. I hope we can come to an agreement.",10100.0,Alice,7,
