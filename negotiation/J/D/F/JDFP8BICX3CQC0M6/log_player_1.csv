I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  It also shows that I believe the product is valuable. However, it's still below the value I placed on it, so I'm not risking too much if Bob rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

$10,000 is far below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob."

I'm offering $17,000, which is still a good deal for Bob, considering he started at $10,000. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not willing to accept it.  I believe I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

I'm offering my minimum value of $15,000.  This shows Bob I'm serious about reaching a deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, but if he rejects it, I'm ready to sell to John for the same price."
