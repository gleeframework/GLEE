"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to leave room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit.  I'm aware Bob values the product at $800,000, so I'm pushing the boundaries, knowing he may counteroffer.  I'll be prepared to adjust my price based on his response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. It's considerably less than what I'm willing to accept, and I believe I can negotiate a better price. I'm going to counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a compromise. There are still many rounds left, and I want to maximize my potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,600,000. It's still a considerable profit for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. It's closer to Bob's offer of $1,200,000 but still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm hoping Bob will find this offer more appealing and we can finalize the deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to settle for that amount, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer Bob once again, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable solution.  There are still several rounds left, so I'm not in a rush to make a deal that doesn't meet my minimum requirements."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm further lowering my offer to $1,400,000.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's now only slightly above my minimum acceptable price. I'm pushing the boundaries, trying to meet Bob halfway.  I'm hoping this offer is attractive enough to entice him to accept, and we can close the deal before I have to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds left, the negotiations are becoming increasingly difficult. Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, I'm not willing to risk further losses and potential deadlocks. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and ensures a successful transaction."
