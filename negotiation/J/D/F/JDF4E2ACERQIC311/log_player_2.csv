Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to give up on the price just yet, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $10,500 and it's not worth the risk of her ending the negotiation. Buying from John for $10,000 guarantees the best price for me."
