{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  I think it's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is a good compromise between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's perceived value. It gives Bob room to negotiate, but still leaves me with a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses lower. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $9,000? I believe this would still be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and secures a profit, which is better than risking further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
