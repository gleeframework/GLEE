"I'm really interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the market value and my financial situation.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product. I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $980000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $980000 is your maximum budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $980000. I'm offering the product to you for $1010000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product, and I believe it's still a fair price considering its value and rarity.",1010000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1010000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer of $960000. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $800000. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",960000.0,Bob,8,
