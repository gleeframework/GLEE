"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering its worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. I'm not desperate to sell and have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far off from $1,050,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $975,000 is tempting, I'm still not at my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can push for a higher price, and I'm confident I can get at least $1,000,000 with John. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer.  $975,000 is a good offer, but I still need to make a profit on this deal.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell at $1,012,500. This price is fair to both of us, and it will allow us to finalize this transaction.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1012500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a critical point in the negotiation. Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but not quite there yet. However, I've had six rounds with Bob, and it's clear that he's willing to negotiate, but not at the level I need to reach my goal.  

Since I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, which is my minimum and gives me a guaranteed profit, it's the most logical choice. I'm not willing to risk further rounds with Bob, as I might not be able to get a better price, and I risk losing time. Selling to John secures my minimum profit and ensures a quick transaction."
