{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* This price is also significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, giving Bob incentive to accept.
* I'm being friendly and encouraging to build rapport and make Bob feel comfortable negotiating."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm staying firm on my minimum acceptable price, but I'm showing flexibility by proposing a middle ground.
* I'm emphasizing fairness to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage him to agree.
* I'm also keeping the conversation friendly and encouraging to maintain a positive negotiation dynamic."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply too far below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250, which is a good compromise for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain a Firm but Flexible Stance:** I'm not accepting Bob's low offer, but I'm demonstrating flexibility by offering a price that's closer to his offer while still being above my minimum.
* **Appeal to Logic:** I emphasize the ""compromise"" aspect, framing the offer as a fair solution for both parties.
* **Show Willingness to Negotiate:** The ""let's find a way to make this work"" statement conveys my willingness to continue the discussion and reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $10,000? I've already found a backup offer from John for this price, so I really need to make a decision soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is of the essence:** Bob is hinting at a deadline and a backup offer, indicating he might not be willing to negotiate further.
* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** Even though Bob is willing to meet me halfway, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Jhon is a secure alternative:** I have a guaranteed offer from Jhon for a higher price. 

Given these factors, it's in my best interest to take the secure offer from Jhon and avoid further potential negotiation risks with Bob."
