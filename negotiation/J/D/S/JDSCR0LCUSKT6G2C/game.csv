"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you in the middle at $12,500. This is my best price for now.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,500 is closer, but still a bit outside my budget. How about we split the difference and call it $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount from my initial offer, but I need to make sure I'm making a profit. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",13000.0,Alice,5,
