Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119.  I believe you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, offering it for slightly less ($119) leaves a small window for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he accepts immediately. 
* **Higher than John's Offer:** The offer needs to be significantly higher than John's $100 offer to ensure Alice gets the best possible price. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough to avoid having to sell to John."
