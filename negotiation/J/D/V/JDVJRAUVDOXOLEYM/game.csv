"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I can get out of it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below my bottom line. This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's true worth.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers, so I'll counter with $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
