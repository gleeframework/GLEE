"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always advantageous to try and negotiate a lower price.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement. We'll see what Alice's counter-offer is before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're aiming to get the best deal possible. A significant drop from $1,200,000 to $1,000,000 shows our seriousness in negotiating but still leaves room for Alice to compromise. This counteroffer is a strong starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to our initial counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation. We can try to push for a lower price by counteroffering again. Buying from John at this point would be too expensive, so we'll continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've shown willingness to negotiate and are now splitting the difference between our last offer and Alice's current offer.  This shows a commitment to reaching an agreement, while still maintaining some leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and we're getting close to our desired price.  While we could try for another round of negotiation, the risk is that Alice might get stubborn and walk away.  Accepting the offer at $1,080,000 is a good compromise and saves us a significant amount compared to buying from John."
