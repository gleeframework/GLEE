Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While I'd like to get more, Bob is consistently moving too slowly towards my desired price. Accepting $10,000 now is a sure thing and avoids the risk of him dropping even lower or me having to settle for John's $8,000 offer in later rounds."
