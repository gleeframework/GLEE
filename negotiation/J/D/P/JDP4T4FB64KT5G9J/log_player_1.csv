Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500.  I believe it offers exceptional value and I'm keen to find it a good home."", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Starting with an offer just below your minimum ($15,000) risks leaving money on the table.
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning you have another buyer (without explicitly stating John's offer) could encourage Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, and you can decide to accept or move closer to your minimum. 
 
**Important Note:** Even if Bob offers less than $14,500, it might still be more profitable to sell to him than John, depending on how low he's willing to go."
