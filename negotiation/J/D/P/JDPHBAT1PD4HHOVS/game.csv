"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product,  $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair price given my assessment of the product's value. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and the discussion. While $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, I know the true value of this product goes beyond that.  Would you consider meeting me halfway at $1,150,000? This reflects the significant potential we both recognize.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value I've assessed, I can go as high as $1,050,000. This would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to make a profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be sure this deal makes sense for me too. How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,100,000?  This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
