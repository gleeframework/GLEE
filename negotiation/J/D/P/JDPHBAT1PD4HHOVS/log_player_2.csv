"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's tempting to accept, I'm confident I can get a better deal.  I'm willing to negotiate with Alice and potentially get the price down closer to my target.  It's risky, but the potential savings outweigh the risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product,  $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair price given my assessment of the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My goal is to get the price as close to my target of $800,000 as possible. This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's opening price, demonstrating my seriousness in negotiating.  I'm aiming to find a middle ground between our valuations, while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer and the discussion. While $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, I know the true value of this product goes beyond that.  Would you consider meeting me halfway at $1,150,000? This reflects the significant potential we both recognize. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high. While it's a step in the right direction, I'm confident I can push for a lower price.  I'm going to continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my target price.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if we can find a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value I've assessed, I can go as high as $1,050,000. This would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to make a profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm trying to inch closer to my target price of $800,000 while still keeping the negotiations moving forward. This offer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while remaining firm on my valuation.  I'm hoping Alice will see the logic in this compromise and accept my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be sure this deal makes sense for me too. How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,100,000?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer to my target price of $800,000. While I'd prefer to pay less, I'm starting to feel the pressure. If I reject this offer, I risk Alice walking away from the deal entirely, leaving me with only John's offer of $1,500,000.  

Accepting this offer gives me a decent price and secures the product, which is ultimately my goal.  I'm willing to take a slightly higher price than ideal to avoid the risk of losing the deal completely."
