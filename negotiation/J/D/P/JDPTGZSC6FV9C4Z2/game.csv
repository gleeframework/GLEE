"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000, which is the price I've been offered by another seller. Can you meet me at that price or lower?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1200000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1300000 to facilitate this deal. I'm confident this price reflects the value you'll gain from the product. Let's work together to make this happen.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1300000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1150000 for the product. I'm confident that this price is fair and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
