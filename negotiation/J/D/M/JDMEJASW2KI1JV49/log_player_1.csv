Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're selling for $95, which is higher than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $95 is still below the $100 Bob values the product at, giving him incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** This offer leaves room for negotiation without being overly aggressive. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $70 is more than my minimum, it's significantly lower than what I'd like to get. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you need a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $78 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's split the difference and go with $81.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 81}
