Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""limited time"" and ""great deal for the value,""  Alice is subtly creating a sense of urgency and justifying the higher price.
* **Fallback Option:** Alice is secure knowing that John will buy the product for $120 if Bob refuses. This knowledge allows her to confidently aim higher with Bob."
