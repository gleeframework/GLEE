Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1450000} 

This offer is above your minimum price of $1,200,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also takes into account that the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, making it a potentially attractive offer for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above the minimum you're willing to accept, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and what the product is worth to you.  Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiations and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than your initial offer but still higher than Bob's.  It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while maintaining a price that's closer to your desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is a significant improvement from his previous offer and is close to your counteroffer. It's also above your minimum price of $1,200,000. At this point, continuing to negotiate risks losing a sale and potentially ending up with John's lower offer. Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible option to secure a decent price and finalize the deal."
