"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,450,000 is within your budget, it's still too high. You can likely negotiate a better price with Alice, especially since she values the product at $1,200,000. Rejecting her offer allows you to explore a lower price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,300,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $1,450,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's also a price that's closer to Alice's perceived value of the product ($1,200,000). This should be an attractive starting point for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my desired price point. I believe I can get a better deal, especially since she has already rejected my counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate. I will try another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $1,350,000. This demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise, but still believe that a price closer to $1,300,000 is more realistic. It's a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer, and hopefully, it will be more appealing to her."
