"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is way above his budget. He can get the same product from John for $8,000.  It makes sense to counteroffer Alice or go straight to John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is above your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $10,500 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  It's best to counteroffer again or go with John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I think it's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice has shown she's unwilling to go lower than $10,000, which is still more than Bob is willing to pay.  John's offer is a much better deal for Bob."
