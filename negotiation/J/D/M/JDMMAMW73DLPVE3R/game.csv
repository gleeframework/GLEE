"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is above your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a reasonable price considering the value to both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. Let me know your thoughts.",9000.0,Bob,4,
