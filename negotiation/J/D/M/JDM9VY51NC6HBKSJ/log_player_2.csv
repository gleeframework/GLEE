**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has rejected Alice's initial offer of $12,000, hoping to get a lower price. Alice has countered with $13,000.  At this point, Bob has three options:

* **Accept Offer:** This is the best option for Bob. $13,000 is still a good deal, saving him $2,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Reject Offer:** This could lead to further negotiations, but there's no guarantee Bob will get a better price. There's also a risk Alice might walk away from the deal entirely.
* **Buy from John:** This is the worst option for Bob as it's the most expensive.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice, as it saves Bob money and avoids further negotiation risks."
