Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target price:** My goal is to maximize profit, so I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Bob's value:** Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000, I'm offering a price that is still attractive to him, but leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **John's offer:** I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay my minimum, so I'm not pressured to accept a significantly lower offer from Bob. 

This offer sets a starting point for negotiation while ensuring I have a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am looking for a price closer to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is something you could consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer:** Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 is closer to my desired price but still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000, making Bob's offer less appealing.
* **Negotiation potential:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a higher price. 

By rejecting Bob's counteroffer, I maintain my bargaining position and increase the likelihood of a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price while still acknowledging Bob's budget constraints. 
* **Compromise:** My counteroffer represents a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my own profit.
* **Negotiation space:**  This counteroffer provides some room for further negotiation, but it's important to maintain my bargaining power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,025,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with our interests. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer:** While Bob's counteroffer of $1,025,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000. This offer is significantly higher than Bob's offer and guarantees me a substantial profit.
* **Negotiation risk:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of further lowering the price or failing to reach an agreement.

Selling to John eliminates the risk of further negotiation and secures the highest possible price."
