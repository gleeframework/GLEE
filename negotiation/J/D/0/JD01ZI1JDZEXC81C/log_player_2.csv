Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to sell it to you for $78, Bob. That's below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $78 and $85, so I'll offer it to you for $81.50. That's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81.5

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $80.  It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $80 than to risk Alice not budging and having to settle for a higher price."
