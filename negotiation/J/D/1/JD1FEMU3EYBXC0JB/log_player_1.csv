Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me at this point. Given its value to you, I'd be willing to pay $950,000. This price would be a fair compromise and allow us to move forward with the transaction. What do you think?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and appreciate you coming down on the price. However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This would allow us to close the deal without exceeding my limits. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.
