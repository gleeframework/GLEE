Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high.  A price of $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit margin.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  The message highlights the product's ""immense value and potential"", aiming to justify the high price. 
* **Confident Tone:**  Using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair reflection"" projects confidence in the product and the offered price.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have some time to negotiate with Bob and that a quick sale isn't your top priority. If you need to sell immediately, a price closer to $1,200,000 would be wiser."
