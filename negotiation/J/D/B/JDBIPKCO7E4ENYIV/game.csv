"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,900000.0
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe you'll find it's a great deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to accept $700,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering John is offering it for $800,000.",700000.0,Bob,4,,

"I can see you're trying to negotiate, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,,
