"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a bold move, but it's important to set a high starting point to give me room to negotiate. I know the product is worth at least $8,000 to me, so I have some leeway to work with. We'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more. It's risky to sell now, especially since I'm within the first few rounds. I'll see if I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves some room for me to potentially get closer to my desired price. If Bob is serious about buying the product, I think he might be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is now offering $8,500, which is closer to my minimum and a good compromise.  We are in round 4, and I don't want to risk going too many rounds further. There is also the possibility of Bob continuing to lower his offer.  I will accept the offer and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
