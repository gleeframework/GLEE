This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Price is Right:**  $1,200,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer of $1,500,000.
* **Finality:** Alice has indicated this is her final offer. Pushing further risks her walking away. 
* **Time:** You've already used 7 of 10 rounds.  While you could try to negotiate further, you risk running out of time and getting stuck with John's higher price."
