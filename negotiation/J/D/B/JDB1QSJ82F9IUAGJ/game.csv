"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for a competitive price of $1,400,000. This represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  How about we bring it down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While I value your offer, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still leaves a substantial margin for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That being said, $1,250,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Could we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? ",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $1,212,500? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",1212500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer.  I appreciate the movement.  To get this done today, I could do $1,190,000. Let me know what you think.",1190000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I've been very patient with you, and I want to close this deal.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,200,000. This is my final offer. If you reject it, I'll be forced to move on to other buyers.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
