"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this valuable product for a price that's certainly within your range.  It's a significant opportunity for you, and I believe you'll find it to be a fantastic investment.  Please let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to get a price significantly higher than what the product is worth to her ($8,000).
* While $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, there's a good chance you can get a better price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or move on to John if necessary."
