"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get this product for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to my business. Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, it's a bit too low for me to accept at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still leaves room for both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's see if we can bridge this gap and make this deal work.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. This feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy with the deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
