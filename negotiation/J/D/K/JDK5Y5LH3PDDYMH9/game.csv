"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that budget is a concern, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1100000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value while being more reasonable for you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $900000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be realistic about my budget. Can you consider $950000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1100000.
