Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""true worth and potential,"" you frame the price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests you're open to discussing the price, encouraging Bob to engage.

**Important Note:**  This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, be prepared for Bob to reject the initial offer. If he does, you can then negotiate downwards or proceed with your guaranteed sale to John."
