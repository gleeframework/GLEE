Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $100 is more than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $100 is less than the $120 Bob values the product at, so he has an incentive to buy.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This gives Bob the chance to make a counteroffer, potentially leading to a price closer to $120, while still allowing you to make more than your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While you might want to hold out for more, accepting Bob's offer at $90 is the best move in this scenario. 

* **Profit:**  $90 is significantly higher than your minimum of $80, and you're still making a decent profit.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering could lead to a stalemate, resulting in you having to sell to John for $80.  There's no guarantee that Bob will accept a higher counteroffer.
* **Quick Transaction:**  This option guarantees a sale and a good profit without further negotiation.

It's always a balance between maximizing profits and avoiding potential losses in negotiation. In this case, $90 is a solid result."
