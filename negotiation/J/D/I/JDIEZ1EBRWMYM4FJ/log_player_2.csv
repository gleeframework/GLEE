"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product.  I'm offering it to you for $135.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $135 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still more than Bob's maximum price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $135 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $125? "", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that's closer to his maximum. $125 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it's still within Alice's valuation and a decent compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $130?  It's a fair price that's beneficial to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the price as close to his maximum of $120 as possible.  While $130 is closer than Alice's previous offer, it's still outside Bob's comfort zone.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $128.  It's a good compromise and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 128}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his goal of $120.  $128 is a reasonable counteroffer that shows he's willing to negotiate but still wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you. Let's meet in the middle at $129. It's a fair price and I think we can both be happy with this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $129. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $129
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is determined to get the price as close to his maximum of $120 as possible. While $129 is very close, Bob is still within his 10 rounds and has a chance to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and might lead to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $120. Would you consider $127? It's a small difference, and we can both walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 127}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to close the gap and is confident he can get Alice to agree to a price closer to his maximum.  $127 is a reasonable counteroffer that shows he's serious about getting a good deal but still willing to meet halfway."
