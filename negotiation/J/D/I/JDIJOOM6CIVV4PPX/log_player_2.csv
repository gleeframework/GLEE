"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, we're confident it's worth more than $80 to you, potentially up to $100 based on your needs. Considering this, I'd like to propose an offer of $95 for the product. This price reflects its true value while allowing us to maintain a fair margin. I hope you find this offer attractive and look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum price of $100.  You're better off rejecting the offer and purchasing from John, even if it means paying a slightly higher price."
