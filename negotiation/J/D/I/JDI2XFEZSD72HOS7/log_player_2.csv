"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are trying to save as much money as possible. While $110 is a good deal, you can likely get it for less.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $105.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do a bit better than that, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $107.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice has lowered her price to $107.5, which is getting closer to your target of $105. While you could try to negotiate further, you risk losing the deal and having to pay John $120. Accepting Alice's offer is the best option to secure the product at a reasonable price."
