"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $115.  What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  Let's make this deal happen!",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is low, but $102.50 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $96?",96.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. $96 is a good offer, but I'm still holding out for something a bit closer to $100. Would you consider $98? It's a fair compromise, and it gets this deal done.",98.0,Alice,5,
