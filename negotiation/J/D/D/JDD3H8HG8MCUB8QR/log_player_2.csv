"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $115.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price well below our $120 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a price we find acceptable, $102.50 is still above our target price. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that $90 is low, but $102.50 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $96?"",
""product_price"": 96
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're proposing a price that's a $6 compromise for both parties from the previous round. This shows willingness to move towards a deal while still aiming for a good discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you. $96 is a good offer, but I'm still holding out for something a bit closer to $100. Would you consider $98? It's a fair compromise, and it gets this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** $98 is a very good price, well below our $120 maximum and only $2 more than our last offer. It's unlikely we'll get a much better deal from Alice, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the opportunity to buy at this price."
