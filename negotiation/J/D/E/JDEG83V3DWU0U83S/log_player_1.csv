Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $1200000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $1,400,000. I have 8 rounds left and want to see if I can negotiate a better deal."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,400,000. While $1,250,000 is a decent offer, I'm not willing to settle yet. I have 6 rounds remaining to see if I can secure a better deal."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,250,000 is still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping to get closer to $1,400,000, we're down to our last 4 rounds and I'm confident I won't get a better price than $1,300,000. It's a good deal for me, and I'm happy to close the deal."
