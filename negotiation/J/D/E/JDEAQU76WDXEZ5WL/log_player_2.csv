Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with it.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $130. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $130. Since you have the option to buy from John for $120, it makes more sense to take that deal and save the extra $10."
