Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your current financial situation. While $800000 is unfortunately below the value I need to get for this product, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1400000. This price still allows me to recoup a reasonable amount while offering you a valuable asset at a price point that is potentially more achievable for you. I'm open to continued negotiation but need to stay above $1400000 to make this deal worthwhile.
