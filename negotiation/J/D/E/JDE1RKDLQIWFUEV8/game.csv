"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's a valuable asset with significant potential. I'm confident it would be a great addition to your portfolio. My initial offer is $2000000.

"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  While I see the potential in this product, I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and my current financial situation.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your current financial situation. While $800000 is unfortunately below the value I need to get for this product, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1400000. This price still allows me to recoup a reasonable amount while offering you a valuable asset at a price point that is potentially more achievable for you. I'm open to continued negotiation but need to stay above $1400000 to make this deal worthwhile.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1400000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. To reach a deal, I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
