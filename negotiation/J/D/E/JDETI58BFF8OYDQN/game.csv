"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm interested in this product but I'd like to offer you $900,000. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,050,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
