{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's estimated value, giving me room to potentially negotiate downwards.  I'm also framing it as a unique opportunity to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm interested in this product but I'd like to offer you $900,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This counteroffer splits the difference between my initial price and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise.  I'm also reiterating the value of the product to keep the pressure on Bob to make a better offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,050,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the most logical choice. It's higher than John's offer, and it avoids further negotiations that could lead to a lower price or a stalemate."
