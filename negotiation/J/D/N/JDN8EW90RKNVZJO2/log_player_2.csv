It's always a good idea to try and negotiate with Alice first.  $6,500 is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount.  Alice might reject this, but it establishes a negotiation range and shows I'm serious about getting a good price."

Alice has come down slightly, but it's still not a price I'm happy with. I'll continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer is a little closer, but I'm still not satisfied. I'll keep pushing for a lower price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5750}

I'm increasing my offer again, but only slightly. I want to show Alice that I'm serious about buying, but I'm not willing to pay her asking price. This is a good tactic to keep the negotiation going."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

I'm raising my offer again, but I'm keeping it just below Alice's offer. This shows that I'm serious about buying, but I'm still not willing to pay her full price.  We're getting closer, and hopefully, Alice will accept this offer.  If not, I'm getting closer to the point where John's offer becomes more attractive."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,600

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is now asking for more than I am willing to pay. While we've been close, I'm not confident that I can get a better deal from Alice in the last round. It's time to take the safe option and buy from John."
