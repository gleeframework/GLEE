"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the market value, but $9,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to part with.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from $10,500. I can do $9,800, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's close this deal.  Would you consider $10,200?  It's a fair compromise.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $10,200 is a bit steep. I can do $9,500, and that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",9500.0,Bob,6,
