Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its true worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, aiming high with Bob initially allows room for negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** The offered price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than John's offer ($1,500,000). This might make Bob think he's getting a ""deal"" compared to the potential loss Alice faces if she goes with John.
* **Open Communication:**  The message invites Bob's input, encouraging a dialogue that could lead to a mutually agreeable price.

**Important Notes:**

* This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. 
* Assess Bob's reactions and willingness to negotiate during the conversation. This will help you determine if you should lower the price or ultimately accept John's offer."
