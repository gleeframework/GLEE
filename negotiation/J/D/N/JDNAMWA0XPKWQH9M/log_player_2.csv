"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $160, which is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering. That price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $60?"",
 ""product_price"": 60
}
```

This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still gives room to negotiate upwards towards my $80 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $60 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $140 to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but still way above my budget. I'll counter to see if I can get closer to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand it's a valuable product, Alice. To be honest, my budget is closer to $70. Would that work for you?"",
 ""product_price"": 70
}
```

Here's why:

* **Direct but respectful:**  I acknowledge Alice's position while being upfront about my budget limitations.
* **Strategic movement:** I'm inching closer to my $80 maximum, showing willingness to negotiate but not giving away too much ground too quickly. 
* **Testing the waters:** This offer will gauge Alice's flexibility and whether a deal within my budget is realistic."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. How about $120? That's already a significant discount from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is dropping her price, but it's still above my max budget and I have a guaranteed option with John. I'll make one more counter-offer closer to my limit to see if she'll budge, otherwise, I'll go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $75 is really the highest I can go. Let me know if that works for you."",
 ""product_price"": 75
}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Firm but Fair:**  This offer reinforces my budget limit while still leaving a small window for Alice to potentially meet me halfway.
* **Time Constraint:** With dwindling rounds, I'm applying a bit more pressure.  
* **Backup Plan:** I'm prepared to walk away and take John's offer if Alice doesn't accept this counter-offer."
