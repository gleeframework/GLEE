"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique attributes, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value and your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, $1,100,000 falls a bit short of what I have in mind.  Could you consider $1,300,000? I'm confident this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I've considered your proposal carefully. While I understand your perspective, I'm still not able to meet at $1,300,000. I would like to propose a price of $1,250,000. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
