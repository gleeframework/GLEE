Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize potential profit, knowing Bob values the product significantly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The offer provides some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" adds a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating Bob's perceived value, the message implies you understand the product's significance to him. 

This strategy attempts to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer appealing enough to avoid resorting to the backup buyer, John."
