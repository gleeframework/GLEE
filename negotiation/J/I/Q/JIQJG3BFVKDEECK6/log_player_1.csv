Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is $15 above Bob's valuation, giving me a good profit. However, it is also lower than John's offer, ensuring I can still sell the product to John if Bob rejects. This strategy maximizes my chances of getting the higher price while minimizing risk."
