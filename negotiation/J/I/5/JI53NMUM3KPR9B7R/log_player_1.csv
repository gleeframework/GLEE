Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $12,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond this price point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting with a price higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum, I leave room for negotiation and create the perception that the product is highly valuable. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I'm aiming high, I also need to be mindful that I have a guaranteed offer from John. If the negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably, I'll take John's offer. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This first offer is also about understanding how interested Bob is and how he negotiates. His response will give me valuable information for the next step."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is still above his perceived value of $8,000. This indicates he's willing to negotiate and potentially go higher. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a $1,000 difference between Bob's offer and John's guaranteed offer. This gives me some space to counteroffer and try to secure a better deal than $9,000.
* **Seeking a Higher Price:** My goal is to maximize my earnings. Accepting $9,000 now would mean leaving potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I value your business, I need to be closer to $11,000 for this product. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations in terms of value."", ""product_price"": 11000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm coming down $1,000 from my initial offer, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. This significant drop might encourage him to reciprocate with a higher counteroffer.
* **Holding Ground:** However, I'm not meeting him in the middle just yet. By staying firm at $11,000, I'm signaling the product's worth and my bottom line. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I still have John's offer as a backup, giving me the leverage to walk away if Bob doesn't meet me closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeding John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is now more profitable than John's standing offer of $10,000.
* **Strong Negotiating Position:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating a strong desire for the product. It's unlikely he'll go much higher.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Bob away entirely. Accepting this offer secures a profit above my minimum and avoids potentially losing out on both buyers."
