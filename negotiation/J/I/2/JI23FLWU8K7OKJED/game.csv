"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $6,500. I understand that it's a bit lower than what I initially offered, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a compromise that I think benefits both of us. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly.  How about $7,200?",7200.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to make sure I get a price that's closer to the product's value to me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $8,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
