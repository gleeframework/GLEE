""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $13,000 or $13,500 is still a significant profit over John's offer of $12,000.

By offering a price closer to Bob's perceived value, Alice increases the likelihood of a sale while still securing a substantial profit."
