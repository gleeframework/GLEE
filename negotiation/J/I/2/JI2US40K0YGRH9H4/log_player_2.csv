# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can negotiate with John or potentially find another seller offering a lower price."
