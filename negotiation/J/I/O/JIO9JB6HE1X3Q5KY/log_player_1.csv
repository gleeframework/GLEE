Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000. 
* **My value:** I value the product at a minimum of $1,000,000. 
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000.

By offering $1,400,000, I aim for:

* **Maximize profit:** I am getting a significant profit above my minimum value.
* **Attract Bob:** The offer is still attractive to Bob, as he can gain $100,000 in value compared to John's offer.

This approach balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for maximizing profit."
