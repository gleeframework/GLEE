"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own it, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking of making an offer of $120. Can you consider that?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer that's a bit more reasonable. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $160. It's a great deal, considering the value it brings to you!",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $160 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $140. Can you consider that?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $140 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to be more flexible, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $155. It's a compromise, but I think it's a good middle ground.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $155 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $145, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you consider that?",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $145 is the highest you're willing to go, Bob. I'm willing to meet you there, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment to the terms. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $148. It's a small increase, but it's still a great deal for you, and it's worth it for the value this product will bring to you.",148.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $148, Alice. I think we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $145 and $148, which would be $146.50. Can you consider that?",146.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $145 and $148, just like you suggested. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $146.50. I'm confident that this is a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you. Let's make a deal!",146.5,Alice,9,
