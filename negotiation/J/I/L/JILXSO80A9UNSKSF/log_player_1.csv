Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,150,000, which is a significant amount but still leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  This price point gives Bob room to counteroffer without feeling like he's being taken advantage of.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  The knowledge that I can sell to John for $1,000,000 provides a solid floor for my negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counter Offer is Close:**  $1,100,000 is not a terrible offer, but it's still lower than my desired price.  
* **Opportunity for a Better Deal:** Since Bob is already interested and has shown willingness to negotiate, I believe there's still room to get closer to my desired price point. 
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not risking too much by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer is halfway between my initial offer ($1,150,000) and Bob's offer ($1,100,000).  This shows a willingness to compromise and encourages him to see the value in my product.
* **Maintaining a Profit:**  $1,125,000 is still well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I've highlighted the product's value to Bob to remind him of its worth and encourage him to make a final decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,125,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is only $75,000 above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While that's a decent profit, it's not worth the potential for further negotiation and the risk of Bob rejecting another counteroffer.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process and ultimately cost me time and energy. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John guarantees me a quick and clean sale at my minimum acceptable price. There's no risk involved, and I can move on to other opportunities.

Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, it makes more sense to accept his offer and avoid the potential for further negotiation with Bob."
