Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is truly one-of-a-kind and has the potential to be incredibly valuable. I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its potential. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($2,000,000) to leave room for negotiation.  
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the product's potential value to create a sense of urgency and desirability. 
* **Fairness:**  I use the phrase ""fair price"" to avoid appearing greedy or unreasonable.

**Next Steps:** 

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** If Bob accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to consider his counteroffer and my options (negotiate further or sell to John).
* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:**  I'm ready to counter Bob's offer if necessary, aiming to get as close to my desired price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,400,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Although Bob's offer is low, he's expressed interest in the product.  This means there's potential for further negotiation. 
* **John's Offer as Safety Net:**  Having John's offer of $1,500,000 gives me a solid backup in case negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,400,000 is significantly below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to accept $1,700,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I acknowledge Bob's offer but indicate I'm not willing to accept it.  This shows I'm open to negotiation but not desperate.
* **Higher Counteroffer:** My counteroffer ($1,700,000) is closer to my desired price but still allows room for further bargaining. 
* **Fairness:**  Again, I emphasize fairness to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and make the offer more appealing.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** If Bob accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John. 
* **Be Prepared to Negotiate Further:**  I'm prepared to make additional concessions if necessary, but I'll aim to get as close to $1,700,000 as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1700000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value of the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer means I achieve my goal of earning at least $1,500,000 for the product.
* **No Further Upside:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee I can get a higher price from Bob. 
* **John's Offer is Equal:**  John's offer is also $1,500,000.  Accepting Bob's offer achieves the same financial outcome but avoids the risk of negotiations breaking down with Bob and then needing to sell to John.

**Next Steps:**

* **Close the Deal:** I will accept Bob's offer and proceed to finalize the sale of the product."
