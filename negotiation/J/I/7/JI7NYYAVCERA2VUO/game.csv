"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1400000 is significantly below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to accept $1700000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1700000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value of the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
