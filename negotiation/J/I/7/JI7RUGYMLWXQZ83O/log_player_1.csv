Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I understand your budget constraints. Could you meet me halfway at $17,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $12,000. How about $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

**Reasoning:**  While continuing the negotiation with Bob might yield a slightly higher price, it's becoming clear that bridging the gap between his valuation ($10,000) and a price acceptable to you (above $15,000) is unlikely. John's guaranteed offer of $15,000 ensures you meet your minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in a later round."
