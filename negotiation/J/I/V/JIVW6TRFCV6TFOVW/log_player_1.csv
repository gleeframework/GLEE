{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal for me and gets me closer to my goal. I've rejected his previous offers because I believe there's still room for a compromise, but I'm starting to run out of time.  I'd rather sell to Bob for $1,080,000 than risk selling to John for $1,000,000 or going through more rounds of negotiation."
