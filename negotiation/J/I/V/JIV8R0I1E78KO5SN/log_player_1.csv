"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a truly valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let's discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Open to discussion:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, indicating flexibility.

**Important considerations:**

* **John's offer:**  I'm aware that John is willing to pay $1,000,000, so I need to keep that in mind as I negotiate with Bob. If Bob's counteroffers get too low, I'll need to consider switching to John.
* **Bob's willingness to pay:** It's possible that Bob's actual willingness to pay is closer to $800,000. I'll need to gauge his response to my offer and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  I value this product, but I have a limit. How about we start around $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and even below the value to Bob of $800,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's clearly interested in the product and willing to negotiate. I'm confident I can get a better price.
* **Avoiding selling to John:**  Selling to John would guarantee $1,000,000, but I believe I can potentially do better with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'll need to counter Bob's offer with a price that's more favorable to me, but still within the range where negotiation is possible.
* **Strategic pricing:**  I'll need to consider Bob's initial counteroffer and my remaining rounds to determine a counteroffer that's high enough to be appealing, but also leaves room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is too far below what I'm looking for. Considering the product's value and our ongoing discussions, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. It's a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering $900,000, which is halfway between my initial offer of $1,200,000 and Bob's offer of $600,000. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Focusing on value:** I'm reiterating the product's value and the benefits of this deal to encourage Bob to reconsider. 
* **Keeping the door open:**  I'm using language like ""let's see if we can reach an agreement"" to signal my willingness to continue negotiating.

**Important considerations:**

* **Remaining rounds:** I'm aware that I have limited rounds left, so I need to strike a balance between being firm and being flexible.
* **John's offer:**  While $900,000 is less than what John would pay, I'm still holding out hope that I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. 
* **Bob's response:** I'll need to pay close attention to Bob's reaction to this counteroffer and be prepared to adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $750,000? This would be a fair deal considering the value and allow me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $750,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and even below the value to Bob of $800,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate, and we're getting closer to a potential agreement. 
* **Avoiding selling to John:**  I'm still hopeful that I can reach a better price with Bob, so I'll continue negotiating. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'll need to counter Bob's offer with a price that's more favorable to me, but still within the range where negotiation is possible.
* **Strategic pricing:**  I'll need to consider Bob's previous counteroffers and the remaining rounds to determine a counteroffer that's high enough to be appealing, but also leaves room for further negotiation.  I also need to consider that I have limited rounds left. 
* **Focus on value:**  I'll continue to emphasize the value of the product and the benefits of this deal to Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However,  $750,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to drop to $850,000. This is a significant concession, and it's a fair price considering the benefits you'll receive. I believe we can come to an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering $850,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $900,000 and Bob's offer of $750,000. This shows a clear willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasize value and benefits:**  I'm reiterating the product's value and the benefits Bob will get from owning it, highlighting the value proposition.
* **Limited rounds:** I'm aware of the limited rounds and need to find a price that's acceptable but also leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive tone, suggesting that we can ""come to an agreement"" to encourage Bob to accept.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's response:** I'll need to pay close attention to Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. If he's unwilling to budge, I might need to consider selling to John.
* **Remaining rounds:** With only 5 rounds left, I need to make sure my counteroffers are strategically placed.
* **John's offer:** I'll continue to keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm ready to close this deal today, but I need it to work within my budget. I can offer you $800,000.  This is my final offer, as I can purchase a similar product elsewhere for this price. Please let me know your decision. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob's limit:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is at his maximum willingness to pay. It's also the value of the product to him, which means he won't go higher.
* **Limited rounds:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, it's unlikely I can get a significantly better price. 
* **John's offer:** While selling to John would bring in $1,000,000, it's important to consider the opportunity cost of delaying the deal. If I reject Bob's offer, I risk losing him as a buyer and potentially not having time to negotiate with another buyer.

**Conclusion:**

This offer is the best I can achieve within the given constraints. Accepting it allows me to close the deal and secure a decent profit."
