"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a truly valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let's discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  I value this product, but I have a limit. How about we start around $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While this is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it establishes a strong initial position. It's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, but it gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Respectful Tone:**  The message aims to be polite and acknowledges the value of the product while clearly stating our budget limitations. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting low, we aim to understand Alice's flexibility and potentially reach a deal well below her initial asking price and our maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is too far below what I'm looking for. Considering the product's value and our ongoing discussions, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. It's a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** $900,000 is still higher than our maximum budget of $800,000.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice dropping her price suggests there's room for further negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:** We have the safety net of buying from John at $800,000 if the negotiation doesn't go as planned."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $750,000? This would be a fair deal considering the value and allow me to stay within my budget."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counter-offer suggests a compromise by meeting Alice halfway between her current offer ($900,000) and our previous offer ($600,000). 
* **Justification:**  We're providing a reason for our counter-offer (staying within budget) to encourage Alice to consider it seriously.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  While moving closer to her price, we're still a significant amount below her initial offer, keeping the pressure on her to negotiate. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** We're getting closer to John's price, so we have a viable backup plan if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However,  $750,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to drop to $850,000. This is a significant concession, and it's a fair price considering the benefits you'll receive. I believe we can come to an agreement on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice is making concessions, $850,000 remains above our strict $800,000 budget.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice is steadily decreasing her asking price, indicating a willingness to negotiate. We are getting close to a potential deal.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** We can use John's offer as leverage to push Alice closer to our acceptable price point."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm ready to close this deal today, but I need it to work within my budget. I can offer you $800,000.  This is my final offer, as I can purchase a similar product elsewhere for this price. Please let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're making it clear that this is our best and final offer, adding a sense of urgency.
* **Budget Justification:** We're reiterating our budget constraint to emphasize the seriousness of our offer.
* **Alternative Option:** We're subtly using John's offer as leverage without explicitly revealing the details. 
* **Decision Point:** By presenting this as our final offer, we're pushing Alice to make a decision. This will reveal if she's truly willing to negotiate within our budget."
