You can definitely do better than $1,200,000.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to try and get a lower price."

Alice is still a bit high, but we're getting closer. I'm going to counter again to see if we can find a price we both feel good about."

While I'd still prefer a lower price, $1,180,000 is a good compromise and is within my budget. It's also getting close to John's price, so it's time to finalize the deal."
