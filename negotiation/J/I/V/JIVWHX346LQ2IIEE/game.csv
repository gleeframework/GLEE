"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. My initial offer is $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,150,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value this product brings to the table.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000?  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My new offer is $1,180,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
