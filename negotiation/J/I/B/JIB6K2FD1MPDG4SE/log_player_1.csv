{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum acceptable price ($10,000), but leaves room for negotiation and potential profit for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $13500 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go up to $12000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below what I think the product is worth.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer, but I can't go as low as $12,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,750? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12750} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant about $12750. Would you consider $12500? It's a fair price for both of us and would allow me to finalize the purchase. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is very close to my counteroffer and is a good deal considering I can always sell to John for $10,000. I'm going to accept his offer."
