"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to me, but I understand it has value for you as well. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair for both of us. How does $1,400,000 sound? This is a substantial discount from its value to me, and it allows you to acquire it for less than you would otherwise be able to.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
