Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This offer is time-sensitive as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, selling to Bob at a higher price brings in more profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,150,000 is still appealing to Bob (saving him $50,000 compared to its value to him), while also netting me a significant profit above my minimum.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By mentioning other interested parties and time sensitivity, I incentivize Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out on a good deal."
