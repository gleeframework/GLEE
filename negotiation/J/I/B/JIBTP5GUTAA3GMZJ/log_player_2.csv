Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $7,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $10,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very slowly lowering her offer. It's unlikely she will come down to a price that beats John's offer of $8,000 before you run out of rounds. You can get the product immediately for a better price by choosing John."
