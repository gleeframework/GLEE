"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value.  This allows for room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  It's important to start high to maximize potential profit, but also be realistic about the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a substantial amount of money, it's still below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm not willing to accept a loss at this point.  I'll counteroffer Bob to try and get closer to my desired price.  However, I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $12,000, so I don't need to be desperate to close a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum value. This shows flexibility while remaining firm in my desire to get a fair price. By offering $13,000, I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob and reach an agreement within the remaining rounds."
