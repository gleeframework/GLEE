Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, but still lower than the product's estimated value to Bob. This gives Bob room to negotiate, while ensuring you still get a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe we can find a better price. How about $950,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is a good offer, it's still below the target profit. It's better to continue the negotiation and attempt to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it'll help us finalize this deal quickly. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm not comfortable going above $980,000 for the product. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $1,035,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,035,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,035,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,035,000 is a good compromise. It's still a healthy profit for you and likely the best deal you'll get without risking further negotiations or potentially selling to John at a lower price."
