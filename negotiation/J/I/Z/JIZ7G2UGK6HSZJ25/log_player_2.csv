# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $14,000. This is a great opportunity to secure a high-quality item at a price that's significantly below its market value of $15,000. I believe this offer presents an excellent deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your situation and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product and your budget constraints, how about we agree on $12,500? This still offers a good value for both parties.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. Considering your offer and the product's value, how about we set the price at $12,250? This is higher than your last proposal but still below the market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250

At this point, Alice is clearly trying to meet in the middle.  While I could try to negotiate further, $12,250 is a reasonable compromise and keeps me well below my $15,000 fallback option with John."
