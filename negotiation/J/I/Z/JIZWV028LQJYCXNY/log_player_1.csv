Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** By offering the product at $119, you're leaving just $1 on the table for Bob, maximizing your potential profit. This price is still very appealing to Bob as it's below his perceived value. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $100 to John, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob declines."
