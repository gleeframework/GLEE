"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. I think this is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $800,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $800,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that work for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $750,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $790,000. I think this is the best compromise we can reach, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable.",790000.0,Alice,5,
