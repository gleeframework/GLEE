"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's truly unique and has immense value. My initial price is $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair reflection of its worth. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below what this product is worth to me.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This allows for a healthy profit margin for you while still being fair for my investment. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $1,000,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while still giving me a good deal.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
