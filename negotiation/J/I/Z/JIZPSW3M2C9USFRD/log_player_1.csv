{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer allows for a good margin of profit for you while also leaving room for negotiation with Bob. $950,000 is a significant price point, but still leaves space for Bob to feel he's getting a good deal, potentially encouraging him to accept or counteroffer.  If Bob rejects, you can then adjust your strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $850,000 is still a good profit for me, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price point. I'm going to counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it's the best I can offer at this time. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $875,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $900,000, $875,000 is still a good profit for me, and it's unlikely Bob will budge further.  I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price."
