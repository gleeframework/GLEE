"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, $1500000 is unfortunately outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is my maximum for this product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is the minimum amount I'm willing to accept, I will accept his offer.
