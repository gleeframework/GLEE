{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $12,000 to you, and Alice's offer is still higher than your target. It's still worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 
This counteroffer is a compromise, closer to Alice's price but still within your budget.  It shows you're serious about buying the product but also signals that you're willing to walk away if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $14,000 is close enough to your target price of $12,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your offer and you might end up having to buy from John at $12,000 anyway.  It's a good compromise to secure the product."
