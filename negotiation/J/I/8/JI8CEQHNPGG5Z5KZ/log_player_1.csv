"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of his upper limit and can adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $5,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm not going to accept that. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $9,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $6,000 is still too low. I will reject Bob's offer and try to push for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm dropping my price to $8,500.  This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping that it will convince Bob to accept.  I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still not willing to go any lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's offer of $7,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I've already made significant concessions and I don't want to risk getting stuck in a long negotiation with him. John is offering a guaranteed $8,000, and I'm not willing to gamble that I can get a better price from Bob."
