Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000** is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but also leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a good deal since the product is worth $1,500,000 to him.
* **The message** is friendly and highlights the value proposition for Bob. It sets a positive tone for the negotiation and encourages a response. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential earnings:** A price of $1,200,000 is a good starting point to get a favorable deal.
* **Encourage negotiation:** Leaving room for negotiation gives Bob a sense of control and incentivizes him to make a counteroffer. 
* **Avoid immediate deal with John:**  This approach allows me to explore a better deal with Bob without losing out on the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to pay $950000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is better than John's offer of $800,000, it's still below my desired range. I believe I can get a better price by rejecting his offer and continuing to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired $1,200,000, but still lower than his initial rejection point. This strategy aims to reach a mutually agreeable price without risking a deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still gives you a good deal, and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is lower than my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. It shows flexibility while maintaining my negotiating position.
* **Message:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. It acknowledges his counteroffer but expresses my willingness to meet halfway.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,100,000 represents a significant step towards a mutually agreeable deal without immediately accepting a price that is too low. 

This approach aims to:

* **Maintain Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Signal Flexibility:** My counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to reciprocate.
* **Increase Profits:**  A price of $1,100,000 is significantly closer to my goal of $1,200,000 than Bob's offer of $950,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to consider $1050000 as a compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd like to get closer to my initial target of $1,200,000, Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a significant improvement over his previous offer and is much higher than John's offer of $800,000. 

Accepting this offer ensures:

* **A good profit:** $1,050,000 is a substantial sum and represents a good return on my investment.
* **Closing the deal:** It avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially ending in a lower offer or a complete stalemate.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Selling to John would guarantee $800,000, but this offer provides a more favorable outcome.

While I could try to push for a higher price, the risk of losing the deal entirely is now higher. Accepting Bob's offer is the most prudent choice to maximize my earnings while ensuring a successful transaction."
