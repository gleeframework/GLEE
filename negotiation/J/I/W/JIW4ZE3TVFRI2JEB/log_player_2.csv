"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1250000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which is still a great price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can still get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer yet.  He can try to negotiate further with Alice, but John remains the safer option at this point."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $1,300,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while also staying within my budget.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1300000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go down to $1325000, which is a fair compromise.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice's final offer is still higher than what John is offering, and Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While there's a chance he could negotiate Alice down further, there's also a chance she'll stick to her offer.  Buying from John guarantees the lowest price."
