"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $13,500. Can you consider $13,250?",13250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $13,250 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $13,375. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable at this price.",13375.0,Alice,5,
