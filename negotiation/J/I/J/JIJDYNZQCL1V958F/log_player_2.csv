"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $22,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  I need to negotiate a much lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter-offer and start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is far too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. I'm sure we can reach a fair agreement."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $22,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still significantly higher than my maximum budget. I need to continue negotiating to get a price closer to my limit. Rejecting the offer allows me to counter-offer and continue the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase. While $18,000 is still my ideal price point, I'm willing to consider $15,000  as my final offer. This allows me to recoup a significant portion of its value.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still significantly higher than my budget.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee she'll come down further.  It's becoming clear that getting a price within my range from Alice is unlikely.  To avoid risking further rounds of negotiation and potentially wasting time, I'll buy the product from John for $8,000, ensuring I get the best possible deal within my budget."
