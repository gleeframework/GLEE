{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. While I am willing to negotiate, I won't accept anything below my floor price.  It's time to make a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $10,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum. It's a better deal than selling to John, and there's no guarantee I'll be able to get a better price in the next round. It's time to accept the offer and move on."
