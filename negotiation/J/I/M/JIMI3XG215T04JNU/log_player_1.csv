"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal for someone with your expertise, and I believe it will be very valuable to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial High Offer:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation and establish a strong starting point. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the product's potential value to Bob, highlighting his expertise and potential gains. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message conveys a willingness to negotiate while also asserting the product's worth. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the number of rounds remaining. I'll also need to factor in the threat of selling to John if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable deal. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,000,000 I consider the product to be worth.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I believe there's room for Bob to increase his offer, especially considering he's interested enough to make a counteroffer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer maintains my leverage in the negotiation and allows me to explore potentially better offers.

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed to Round 3 and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap and get closer to my desired price while still keeping the potential of selling to John in mind."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 isn't quite meeting my expectations.  Considering the unique value this product holds for someone like you, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price still reflects the value it offers, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Justification:**  I'm not drastically lowering my price, demonstrating that I'm taking his offer seriously. I'm emphasizing the product's unique value to him and framing my counteroffer as a compromise.
* **Reasonable Drop:**  A $100,000 drop shows flexibility while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Maintain Pressure:**  I'm not accepting his current offer, but my counteroffer shows I'm still open to reaching an agreement.  

**Important Note:**  The number of rounds remaining and the potential of selling to John will continue to influence my decisions.  If Bob doesn't come up in price, I'll need to consider if selling to John is the better option in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has unique value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is inching closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,000,000.  
* **Risk of Stalling:**  We've already gone through several rounds, and I risk further delaying a deal if I accept this offer. 
* **Potential for a Better Offer:**  I'm hoping that by rejecting this offer, I can incentivize Bob to come up further in price, especially as we're nearing the midpoint of the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to Round 5 and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum while keeping the option of selling to John in mind. The goal is to bridge the remaining gap and find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  Considering the value this product holds for you, and the limited time we have left to negotiate, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the compromise I'm making, but it's still a price that reflects the unique value you'll gain from this product.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lowering the Price:**  I'm now offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to reach a deal. However, I'm still holding out for a price that is above my minimum.
* **Time Pressure:**  I'm subtly highlighting the limited rounds left, adding a sense of urgency to motivate Bob.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value for Bob, reinforcing the potential benefits he'll gain.

**Next Steps:**

I'm now closer to my minimum price, but I need to see how Bob responds.  If he rejects this offer, I'll need to weigh the risk of selling to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000 against the potential of securing a higher price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and the value I'll gain from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation process, with only four rounds remaining. 
* **Risk of Further Stalling:**  There's a high chance that Bob won't budge further, and we might end up with a stalemate.

**The Trade-off:**

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, the risk of not closing a deal and ending up with nothing outweighs the potential gain of getting a few more thousand dollars from Bob.

**Decision:**

Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might not yield a better result.  It's a safe and sensible decision, given the current circumstances."
