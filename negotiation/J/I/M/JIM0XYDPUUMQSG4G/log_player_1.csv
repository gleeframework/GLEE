Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,750,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $1600000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm not willing to sell for $1,600,000 yet, especially since I have 8 more rounds and the option to sell to John. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1650000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to offer $1625000. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. We've only had 4 rounds, and I have 6 more to try and reach a higher price. Selling to John at this point would be leaving a significant amount of money on the table. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close to accepting, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to offer $1612500. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,612,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,612,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I believe we can still reach a higher price. We only have 4 rounds left, and selling to John would mean losing out on potentially $100,000+ in profits. I'll counteroffer one last time before considering John's offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're nearly there. This is my final offer - $1,620,000. It's a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal.  If you reject this offer, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1620000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the wire.  Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum, but it's still too low for me. I'm only one round away from having to sell to John.  Considering the risk that Bob might continue to lowball me, I'll take the sure thing and sell to John for $1,500,000.  While it's not the ideal outcome, it's still a significant profit and ensures I don't lose out completely."
