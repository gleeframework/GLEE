"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing the value the product offers to Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers, encouraging Bob to engage in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $5,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000 and even lower than my initial offer of $12,000. 
* **More negotiation is needed:** While Bob's rejection indicates his willingness to negotiate, his counteroffer is too far off. I need to try to bridge the gap.
* **Avoiding John's offer:** While selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed win, I still want to see if I can get closer to that amount through negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $5,000 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to drop my price to $9,000. This is still a great price for the value the product provides you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards the middle:**  I'm proposing a price halfway between my initial offer ($12,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($5,000). This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Re-emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product offers, further justifying the price.
* **Creating urgency:**  By suggesting a meeting in the middle, I'm subtly implying that this might be the best deal he'll get, increasing his incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $9,000. Would you consider $7,000? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** $7,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation continues:**  Bob is showing signs of wanting to close the deal, but his offer is still too low. There's room for further negotiation to get closer to my desired price.
* **Avoiding John's offer:**  While I could sell to John for $15,000, I'm still hoping to squeeze a better deal out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,500. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive from the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my previous offer ($9,000) and Bob's current offer ($7,000). This shows my continued willingness to compromise and find a middle ground.
* **Highlighting concessions:** I'm emphasizing that this is a significant drop from my previous offer, making it seem like a more appealing deal for Bob.
* **Expressing urgency:** I'm using phrases like ""let's make this happen"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,250. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work, I'll have to go with a different vendor.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,250 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Final offer:** Bob has clearly stated this is his final offer. If I reject it, I risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Risk of losing John:**  While I could sell to John for $15,000, there's no guarantee that John will still be available or interested in the product if I continue negotiating with Bob and waste more time. 

Given the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice. It secures a sale at a price that's significantly better than his initial offer and relatively close to my minimum acceptable value."
