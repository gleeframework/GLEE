,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $15,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is a fair price for the value this product offers.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $16,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",16250.0,Bob,4,
