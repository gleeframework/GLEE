{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your budget. It's worth negotiating to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $15,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is a fair price for the value this product offers.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $17,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a price closer to $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $16,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you clearly see the value in this product. Let's close this deal.  Would you consider $16,800? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still too high at $16,800.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm concerned that we won't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.  It's safer to buy from John at his price of $15,000 to guarantee I get the product within my budget."
