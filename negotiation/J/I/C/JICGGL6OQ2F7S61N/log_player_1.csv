Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'd like to make a deal, $7,500 is too low for me. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit to $8,500.  This is still a great deal for a product that's worth so much to you.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,800. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While he's getting closer, I'm not yet comfortable selling for $7,800. I'll try to negotiate a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're getting closer to my price point, but $7,800 still isn't quite there. Let's split the difference: I'll accept $8,200 for this exceptional product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 8200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,900. I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer, we're running out of time and the price isn't quite where I want it to be. I'm going to sell to John for $8,000. It's a secure deal and I don't want to risk further negotiation."
