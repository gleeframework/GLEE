"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit to $8,500.  This is still a great deal for a product that's worth so much to you.  Let's make this happen!",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,800. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're getting closer to my price point, but $7,800 still isn't quite there. Let's split the difference: I'll accept $8,200 for this exceptional product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we both walk away happy.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,900. I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",7900.0,Bob,6,
