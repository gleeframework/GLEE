{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appeal to Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to make the offer more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message indicates that I'm open to discussing the price further. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've secured a good deal. 
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a counteroffer of my own. 
* **If negotiations stall:** I can always go with John's offer of $1,500,000, ensuring I get my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to save some money on this deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly less than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000 and doesn't reflect the value I place on the product.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's counteroffer is lower than expected, there's still room for negotiation. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me leverage in these negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions. 
* I will focus on emphasizing the product's value and the benefits Bob will receive by making a deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price is still fair considering the value of the product to you, and it allows us to both walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing that $1,100,000 is still a good deal.
* **Positive Framing:**  I use positive language (""walk away satisfied"") to create a sense of win-win.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've achieved a good outcome, balancing getting a reasonable price with closing the deal.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll analyze his response and decide whether to further negotiate or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from reaching my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,100,000. How about we try $1,050,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob has increased his offer, $1,050,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still a significant gap between our positions, suggesting further negotiation is possible.
* **John's offer is still my safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for a higher price gives me leverage.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make another counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap further. I might suggest a price closer to $1,200,000, explaining that this is a reasonable compromise given the value of the product to Bob. 
* I will continue to emphasize the benefits Bob will receive from acquiring the product."
