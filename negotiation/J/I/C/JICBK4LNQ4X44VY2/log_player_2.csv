Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price is still fair considering the value of the product to you, and it allows us to both walk away satisfied. What do you say?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  However,  $1,050,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to compromise further,  but  $1,200,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. This price reflects the true value of the product to you and allows for a win-win scenario. I'm confident this is a price that you'll find beneficial in the long run.
