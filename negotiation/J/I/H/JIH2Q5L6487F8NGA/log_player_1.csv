Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While I do see the value in your product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to offer $850,000 for it, which still gives you a good profit and is a more attractive price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
