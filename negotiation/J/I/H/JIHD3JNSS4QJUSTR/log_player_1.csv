Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a sale. 

Here's the reasoning:

* **It's more than your minimum:** $9,500 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000, ensuring you still make a good profit.
* **It's within Bob's range:** $9,500 is still less than the product's value to Bob ($10,000), making the offer attractive to him. 
* **It minimizes risk:** If Bob rejects, you still have John lined up to buy the product for your minimum acceptable price, guaranteeing a sale. 

While a higher offer could potentially earn you more, it also increases the risk of Bob rejecting it. This strategy aims for a balance between profit and the likelihood of a successful transaction."
