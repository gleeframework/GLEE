"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice is asking for $12,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds to get a better price, so it's worth rejecting the initial offer and trying to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Discount:** This offer is a $3,000 reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate seriously. 
* **Within Your Budget:**  $9,000 is still significantly lower than your maximum price of $15,000, leaving room for potential compromise.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Progress:** Alice's offer of $10,000 is a $2,000 drop from her previous offer and brings the price closer to your desired range.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While you could continue negotiating, there's a chance Alice might become less flexible or the deal could fall apart.  Accepting this offer guarantees you get the product for a price significantly lower than John's offer. 
* **Time Pressure:**  You only have 10 rounds, and each round wasted increases the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price."
