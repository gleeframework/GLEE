"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000?  I think that's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  While $12,500 is a bit high for my budget, I could meet you halfway at $11,250.  What do you say?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, and offer the product for $11,875. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal. Let's finalize this! ",11875.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been a tough negotiator! I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  How about we settle this right now at $11,500?  It's a fair deal and we can both walk away happy.",11500.0,Bob,6,
