Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Bob I'm serious about getting a good price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that price just yet. I'll try to get a better price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still want a fair price."

Bob's offer is $1,000 more than John's offer. It's worth accepting this offer as it's closer to my desired price."
