Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $95 is higher than your minimum price of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $100, so there's still space for him to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It shows you're serious:** By offering a specific price, you're demonstrating that you're not just playing games and are open to a quick deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still worth trying to get closer to your desired price.  By rejecting his offer and counteroffering, you might be able to reach a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $85.  How about we split the difference at $90?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we settle on $87? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll still make a good profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $87 isn't ideal, it's very close to your desired price and is still a good profit margin.  Further negotiation might not be worth the time and risk of losing the sale to John, who is willing to buy for $80."
