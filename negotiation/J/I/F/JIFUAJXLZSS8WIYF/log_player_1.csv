"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. I'm also hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay.  If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, but I still believe I can get more. I'll counter with a price that's closer to my desired profit.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I think I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $1,400,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves room for a profitable sale. I'm hoping this is close enough to his desired price to get a deal done quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but it's still above my minimum.  I'm going to try to get a better price by counter-offering. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I still think I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm going to drop my price a bit further, to $1,250,000. This is a significant concession, but it keeps the price above my minimum and hopefully entices Bob to accept. I'm running out of rounds, so I need to find a balance between making a deal and potentially losing out to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is getting risky. Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, and I'm running out of rounds.  While I'd prefer to get a bit more, I'm concerned I'll lose out to John if I keep rejecting.  Accepting this offer secures a profit, and I'm not willing to gamble further."
