"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the product's true value. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in the product, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $1,005,000?
