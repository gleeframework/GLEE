Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000) than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This gives me some room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for both of us, rather than focusing on how much profit I'll make. This makes the offer more appealing and less adversarial.
* **Openness to negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation by asking Bob for his thoughts. 

**Why this strategy:** 

This strategy aims to secure a price close to my minimum while leaving room for negotiation. It's important to keep in mind that the goal is to maximize profit, but also to create a positive and productive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but  $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $900,000?  That feels like a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction in price.  Therefore, I will reject his offer and proceed with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a great deal for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price and closer to the middle ground between our initial positions.
* **Reiterate value:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for both of us, again framing it as a win-win situation.
* **Show flexibility:** I'm signaling my willingness to compromise by suggesting we ""find a middle ground"".
* **Avoid going too low:** While $1,000,000 is a significant reduction from my starting price, it's still above my minimum acceptable price and allows for further negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

I'm attempting to reach a compromise that is mutually beneficial. By demonstrating flexibility and showing that I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, I hope to increase the chances of reaching an agreement."
