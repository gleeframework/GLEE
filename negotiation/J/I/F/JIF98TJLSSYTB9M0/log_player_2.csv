"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. This is a great deal for you, as you'll be getting it for less than what it's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Alice's statement about the product's worth to me is manipulative, the raw numbers are clear:

* **Alice's Offer:** $12,000
* **John's Offer:** $10,000

My goal is to save money, and John's offer is the best way to do that."
