"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. Would you be willing to consider that?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $11500 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $13000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $13500? Let's find a price that works for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11500 and $13500. How about $12500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $13000.  How about $13250? It's a fair price, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to stay above $13000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $13250. How about $12625?",12625.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12625 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to go down a bit more, but I need to stay above $13000 to make this work. How about $13125? That's a reasonable compromise, and it brings us much closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think.",13125.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to stay above $13000, but I'm really close to my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $13125. How about $12562.50?",12562.5,Bob,8,
