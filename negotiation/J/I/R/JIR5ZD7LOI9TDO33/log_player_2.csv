"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is overpriced. We can definitely negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaving room for negotiation. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  A significant counteroffer helps us understand how much Alice is willing to budge.
* **Work towards a favorable price:** By starting lower, we increase the chances of securing a price closer to our target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but it's still above our target. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $90? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're continuing to move towards a compromise, inching closer to our ideal price. By suggesting $90, we're splitting the difference between our last offer and her current offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I think we're getting close! I'm willing to meet you at $92.50. I think that's a fair price for this great product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting very close to our budget, but we're still aiming to save as much as possible. There's a chance we might be able to get her down a little more, even if it's just a few dollars. It's worth another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've got me really considering this!  To make this work for me, could you do $90 even? That would seal the deal."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're holding firm at our previous offer of $90, reinforcing that this is a price point we're comfortable with. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By saying ""that would seal the deal,"" we're signaling to Alice that we're close to an agreement and prompting a decision.
* **Alternative Option:**  While we haven't threatened to walk away outright, the existence of John's offer provides implicit leverage.  Alice knows we have other options if we don't reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're serious about buying the product! I'm willing to meet you at $91.50. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice is clearly committed to selling, and $91.50 is a very good price â€“ a $8.50 savings from her initial offer.
* **Time Investment:** Continuing to negotiate might yield another dollar or two in savings, but it's not guaranteed. Accepting now avoids the risk of Alice increasing her price or the negotiation reaching a standstill. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While we could potentially get the product for $100 from John, we've already invested time in negotiating with Alice. Accepting her offer secures the product now at a favorable price."
