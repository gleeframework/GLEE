"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700,000.",700000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I was hoping for a price closer to $600,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a competitive price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $650,000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $625,000? That's a good compromise for both of us.",625000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $625,000 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $675,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,5,
