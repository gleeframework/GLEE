"I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $1,100,000? This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to get a fair return on my investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $950,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to make a profit on this sale.  $950,000 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a great product and me to make a reasonable return.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I'll pay $975,000 for the product. Is that a price you'd be willing to accept?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your persistence and we're getting closer. However, $975,000 isn't quite enough for me to let go of this valuable product. How about we meet in the middle again and settle on $1,000,000? This would be a win-win situation for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
