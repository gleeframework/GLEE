Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit.
* **Justification:** While simply stating a price is an option, providing a brief reason (even a generic one like ""great deal for the value"") can sometimes make a buyer more receptive.
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts, I've made a profit. If he rejects, I can always fall back on selling to John for my minimum price."
