Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product much higher than your minimum acceptable price.  This presents an opportunity to negotiate a price significantly higher than $800,000.
* **Strong Starting Point:**  Starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value increases the chances of securing a deal within a profitable range for you. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,300,000 leaves room for potential counter-offers from Bob, while still securing a substantial profit for you.
* **Backup Plan:** You have the security of John's offer ($800,000), so you're not desperate and can confidently negotiate a higher price with Bob. 

By setting a high but justifiable initial offer, you maximize your potential profit while maintaining a strategic advantage in the negotiation."
