I'm still hoping to get the price down a bit more.  $9,000 is closer, but I'll see if I can get it lower with another counteroffer."

Alice has come down to $8,800, which is a good deal for me.  I'm comfortable with that price and don't want to risk losing out on the deal by continuing to negotiate."
