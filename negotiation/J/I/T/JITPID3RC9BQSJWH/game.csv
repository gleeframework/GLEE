,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  Let's try $10,500. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase. ",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,800 is still slightly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,200 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on it, and it would allow me to finalize the purchase.  Let me know if you're agreeable to this offer.",10200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,200 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise considering the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but unfortunately $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to purchase the product for $10,100.  This is my final offer, as it aligns with my budget constraints. If you accept, we can finalize the deal.",10100.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,100 is your final offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $10,300. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.",10300.0,Alice,9,
