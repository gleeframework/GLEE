"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm confident this product will be a significant asset to your business. Let me know your thoughts!",1700000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000 to make this deal work.  This is still a significant discount from my initial price, and it reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial solution. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but the gap is still too wide. To be honest, anything above $700,000 is pushing it for me.  I'm willing to go up to $650,000 if that gets us closer.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, $650,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to $1 million. How about $900,000? It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of this product. Let's make this deal happen.",900000.0,Alice,5,
