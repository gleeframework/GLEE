,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $11,000.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your position, but $11,000 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $15,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm very close to my budget limit. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  This would give us both a fair deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
