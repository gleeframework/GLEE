"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable agreement. Could we discuss a price closer to $8000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you think the product is worth $8000, but I'm afraid I have to be realistic about the value I'm willing to accept. Considering the product's unique features and my costs, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $18000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my research and budget constraints, I am unable to go above $8000 for this product. Would it be possible for us to meet at this price point?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on the deal. I'm now offering the product to you for $12000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with a price of $10000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not giving it away. I'm now offering the product to you for $14000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not convinced that $12000 is a fair price for this product. I've already made several concessions, and I'm starting to think that it's time to consider other options. However, I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $13500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",13500.0,Alice,9,

"Bob, I'm surprised you're still interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $14000. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $13500, but I need you to meet me halfway from there.

"Bob, I'm starting to think that we're never going to agree on a price. I've made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $14000. I'm going to make one last offer, and it's non-negotiable. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000, but that's as low as I'll go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,13,
