Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $11,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, there's a chance to earn an extra $1,000 by selling to Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $11,000 creates a significant perceived value for Bob. He gets a $1,000 ""discount"" from your backup offer while you still gain a substantial profit. 
* **""Exclusive Opportunity""**:  Framing the offer as exclusive adds a sense of urgency and desirability.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale with Bob."
