Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price slightly. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response will be telling. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he negotiates, you have the buffer to meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob."
