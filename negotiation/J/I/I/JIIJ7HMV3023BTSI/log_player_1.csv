Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $9,500 is higher than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already in a good position.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $9,500 is lower than the $10,000 Bob values the product at, giving him a potential gain.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can still increase the price if Bob is willing to pay more.

By offering a reasonable price and leaving room for negotiation, you increase the likelihood of a successful sale while maximizing your potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $8,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and our mutual interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is at your minimum price, you have the potential to earn more by continuing the negotiation. You've already established that the product is worth more than $8,000 to Bob. It's worth trying to get closer to your initial offer of $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to accept $8,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I believe we can find a better solution. Would you consider accepting $8,500 for the product? This price still reflects its value while allowing us to reach a fair agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While it's tempting to keep pushing for a higher price, Bob's offer of $8,500 is very close to your minimum and still a better outcome than selling to John for $8,000. There's a good chance the negotiation could go on for several more rounds and you might not get a higher price.  It's best to accept this offer and secure a sale."
