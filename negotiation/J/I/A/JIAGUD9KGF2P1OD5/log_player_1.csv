Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think the product is worth less than that. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the product's inherent qualities and potential command a higher price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $2,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value and potential of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to the value he places on the product ($800,000), we still have room to negotiate and aim for a price closer to our minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000). We are also still significantly above John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value and potential of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** At $1,900,000, Bob's offer is now significantly above our minimum ($1,500,000) and represents a strong profit. Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away or our offers dropping too close to John's standing offer. Accepting secures a sizable profit now."
