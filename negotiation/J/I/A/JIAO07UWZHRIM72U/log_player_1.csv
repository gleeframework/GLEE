"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and it's still well below what it's worth to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$100:** This is a starting point that leaves some room for negotiation but also ensures I'm not giving away too much value.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win, highlighting the benefit for Bob while also subtly reminding him of the value I'm placing on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still within the first few rounds. I can likely push for a better price. I'm also keeping in mind that John is a guaranteed buyer for $120, which gives me a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. How about $95?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $95, which is halfway between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $90.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and expressing willingness to negotiate. I'm also highlighting the fairness of my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $92.50? Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$92.50 is close enough to my minimum:**  While I'd love to get closer to $100, $92.50 is within my acceptable range.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a good chance that further negotiation will lead to lower offers, potentially even below my minimum of $120.
* **Time factor:** With 6 rounds left, there's no guarantee I'll be able to get a better offer.
* **Safe alternative:** I can still sell to John for $120 if the negotiation falls apart.

I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure a reasonable sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
