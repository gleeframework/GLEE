"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us â€“ you get a significant discount, and I can still make a good profit.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product from John for $1,000,000. Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is higher than that, meaning Bob can save $100,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
