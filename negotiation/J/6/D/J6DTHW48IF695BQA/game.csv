"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is significantly below my asking price, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm open to lowering the price to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  This would be a mutually beneficial deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to accept.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
