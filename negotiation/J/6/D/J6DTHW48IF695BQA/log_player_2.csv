Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is significantly below my asking price, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm open to lowering the price to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What are your thoughts?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to accept.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $850,000. It's time to cut the losses and take the guaranteed deal from John at $800,000."
