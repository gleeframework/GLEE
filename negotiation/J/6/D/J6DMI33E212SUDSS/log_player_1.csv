"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $80. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate your offer, but I still believe that $80 would be a fair price for the product. Could we possibly meet at this price point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly anchored at $80 and unwilling to budge.  There's no point in further negotiation as it's unlikely we'll get a better offer from him. We can secure our minimum acceptable price with John."
