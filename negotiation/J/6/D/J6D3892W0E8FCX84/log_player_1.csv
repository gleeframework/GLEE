Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175} 
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price, while still being competitive compared to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price and significantly lower than John's offer.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $160. This is still higher than Bob's offer but closer to his proposed price, showing I'm willing to negotiate. This gives me a chance to get closer to my target price while still being competitive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get him to go any higher. At this point, selling to John for $150 is a safer and more profitable option."
