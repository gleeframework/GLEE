Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think you'd find it very valuable. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $175 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $165 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 
It's getting close to the point where further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result. Taking $165 is better than potentially ending up with John's offer of $150 if Bob's offers continue to decrease."
