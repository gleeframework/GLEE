Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $2,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle somewhere? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

Bob's offer now matches what John is willing to pay.  There's no benefit to continuing the negotiation as it's unlikely Bob will go higher. It's best to accept and avoid the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away."
