{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$9,000 is still far below my minimum value of $15,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  Let's find a number that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to make one more offer. How about $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $9,800 is getting closer to my minimum,  it's still risky to continue negotiating with Bob. I've already made several concessions, and there's a chance he'll keep trying to lower the price.  John is a sure bet for $15,000, and it's better to guarantee that profit than risk losing more time and money trying to negotiate with Bob."
