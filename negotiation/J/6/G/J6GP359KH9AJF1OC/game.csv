"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it. Can you consider that?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  Given the unique value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $900000. This is still a substantial discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $875000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product offers.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, let's be realistic here. We're both close to a deal, but $825000 simply isn't enough for me. To make this work, I'm offering a final concession: $850000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I don't think we'll get closer to a deal with the rounds we have left.",850000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go above $825000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $837500 for the product. Can you consider that?",837500.0,Bob,8,
