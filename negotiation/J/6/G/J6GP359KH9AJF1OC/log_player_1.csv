"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a higher price. I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, but I'm hoping to get more.  I have 9 rounds left, so there's still time to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  Given the unique value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I have 7 rounds left and I'm confident I can secure a deal closer to my initial asking price."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $825,000 is close to what I'd get from John, I still have 5 rounds left and I'm determined to see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic here. We're both close to a deal, but $825,000 simply isn't enough for me. To make this work, I'm offering a final concession: $850,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I don't think we'll get closer to a deal with the rounds we have left."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go above $825000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $837500 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $837,500. 
You have three options:

```

With only two rounds remaining, Bob is not budging on his price, and I'm running out of time. While I would prefer to get a higher price, I'm not willing to risk losing a sale altogether. Selling to John for $800,000 is the most sensible option at this point."
