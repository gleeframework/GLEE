"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum price of $15,000, and leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $16,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to see if I can get him to budge a bit more before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob without giving away too much of my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  He's moved closer to my desired price, and I'm happy with $16,500. It's getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
