"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my minimum requirement. I can offer you a price of $10000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to finalize the deal.",10000.0,Alice,7,
