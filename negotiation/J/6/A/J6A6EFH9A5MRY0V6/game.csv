"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product is interesting,  $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However,  $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Could you do $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and meet you at $1,180,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",1180000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm getting close to my limit, but I could do $1,140,000 to close the deal.",1140000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $1,180,000. However, I'm willing to make a small concession to $1,160,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1160000.0,Alice,7,
