"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $900,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $700,000. Would that be something you'd consider?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $700,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,5,
