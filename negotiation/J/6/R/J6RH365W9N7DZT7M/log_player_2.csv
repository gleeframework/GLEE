# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $700,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice is unlikely to go any lower and we're getting very close to John's offer. It's time to take the guaranteed deal."
