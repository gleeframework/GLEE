Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for both of us, emphasizing mutual benefit.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending the message with ""Let me know what you think"", signaling that I'm open to discussion and counteroffers.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John as a backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,200,000 provides me with a safety net. I can afford to be slightly more aggressive in my negotiations with Bob.
* **Finding the sweet spot:** The goal is to find a price that's acceptable to Bob but also maximizes my profit. 
* **Potential counteroffers:** I'm prepared for Bob to counter with a lower price. I'll need to assess the counteroffer and determine if it's worth continuing the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but not close enough:**  While $900,000 is a significant improvement from his initial assessment, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price, which might lead to a more favorable outcome.
* **John's offer as leverage:**  Knowing that John is willing to pay $1,200,000 gives me a strong bargaining position. I can be more assertive in my counteroffers.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. I'll need to carefully consider Bob's perceived value of the product and my own bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a little lower than I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  This would allow us both to get a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows a willingness to compromise while maintaining my bargaining power. 
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""good deal"" for both of us to keep the negotiations amicable and increase the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Reiterate my willingness to negotiate:**  I'm asking ""What do you think?"" to signal that I'm open to further discussion if needed.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Balancing profit and compromise:** I'm trying to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and finding a price that's acceptable to Bob. 
* **The risk of losing Bob:** I'm aware that my counteroffer could lead Bob to walk away. However, I'm willing to take that risk to secure a higher price.
* **Staying prepared for further counteroffers:**  I'm ready to counter again if necessary. I'll continue to assess Bob's responses and adjust my approach accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $920,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation fatigue:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could be time-consuming and potentially lead to a lower price.
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and a guaranteed sale.  It's a safer and more financially advantageous option.

**Conclusion:** 

It's time to cut my losses with Bob and move forward with the guaranteed sale to John."
