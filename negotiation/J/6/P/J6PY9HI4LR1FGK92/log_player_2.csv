"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000.  It's too risky to accept at this point.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in this product, but my budget is around $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $15,000 is already a very competitive price for this product. To meet you halfway, I could go down to $13,500. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,500 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. I'm prepared to offer $11,000, which is the absolute maximum I can pay at this time.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
