Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth your consideration.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:** This allows for potential counteroffers from Bob without me immediately having to drop to his price. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" to make Bob more inclined to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great! I've successfully negotiated a good price.
* If Bob rejects: I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter again, keeping in mind my minimum price of $15,000 with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Counteroffer is necessary:** I need to push for a higher price to ensure I get closer to my desired value. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a more agreeable price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to my desired $14,000 or higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,500 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $12,500. This is a good price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Reiterate value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to justify the price. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""good price for both of us"" to create a sense of win-win and encourage acceptance.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great! I've secured a fair price closer to my desired range.
* If Bob rejects: I'll have to carefully consider his next counteroffer and whether I'm willing to negotiate further or sell to John for my minimum price."
