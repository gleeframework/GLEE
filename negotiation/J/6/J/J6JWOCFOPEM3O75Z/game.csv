"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be very valuable to you and I'm hoping we can make a deal.  To start things off, I'm proposing a price of $22,000.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $22,000 is much higher than I'm willing to pay.  To start, I'm offering $10,000. I'm eager to make a deal, but this needs to be within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer! I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle a bit? Would you consider $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $18,000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying.  How about $14,000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit.",14000.0,Bob,4,
