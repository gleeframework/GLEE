"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is still significantly below his perceived value of the product. While accepting would secure a profit, there's room for negotiation to bridge the gap and aim for a higher selling price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** By suggesting $1,100,000, we're splitting the difference between Bob's offer ($1,050,000) and our previous asking price ($1,150,000). This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still Above Minimum:** This price point still ensures a substantial profit above our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Encouraging Agreement:**  The message aims to nudge Bob towards a quicker agreement while still holding onto a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try to find common ground. I would like to propose a price of $1,075,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is inching closer to a more reasonable price, we're still in a strong negotiating position. We have several rounds left, and it's worth seeing if we can push for a higher price before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. It seems we're getting closer. To move things along, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,090,000.  This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 1090000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a smaller concession this round ($10,000 instead of $25,000) to signal that we're nearing our bottom line.
* **Introducing Urgency:**  Mentioning another buyer (even if hypothetical) creates a sense of urgency and competition for Bob. 
* **Final Offer:**  By stating this is our final offer, we're setting a clear boundary and putting the decision pressure on Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. Considering the negotiations, I would like to propose a price of $1,085,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Accepting Bob's offer at $1,085,000 still secures a significant profit of $85,000 above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob walking away or stalling negotiations. Accepting now locks in a good deal. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal sooner rather than later means we can re-invest the funds or use them for other opportunities. 
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:**  While we technically could counter again, Bob might be less likely to move significantly after we've declared a ""final offer."""
