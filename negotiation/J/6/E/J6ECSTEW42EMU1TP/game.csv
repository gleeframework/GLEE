"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you've shown interest in.  My starting price is $115.  What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $105?  I'm really interested in this product and think this is a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value of this product.  What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a little high for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $107.50?  This is a fair price that gets us both closer to what we want.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle. However, $107.50 is still a little too low for me. Let's try $112.50.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and it gets us closer to an agreement.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $112.50 is still too much for me. Let's try $109.  It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to an agreement. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for everyone.",109.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $109 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $111.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and gets us closer to an agreement.  Let's close this deal.",111.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down.  $111 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $110?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and I'm confident we can close the deal.  Let's make it happen!",110.0,Bob,8,
