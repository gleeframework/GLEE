"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you've shown interest in.  My starting price is $115.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $115 is better than John's price, it's still above Bob's maximum value of $100.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $105?  I'm really interested in this product and think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price, but he needs to be realistic.  A large jump from $115 to $100 might seem too aggressive.  
* **Compromise:**  $105 is a compromise, showing Bob is willing to negotiate but not willing to overpay.
* **Positive tone:** The message expresses interest in the product, making Alice more likely to consider the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value of this product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above value:** While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum value of $100. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, indicating there's still room for a lower price.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue trying to get closer to his target. 
* **John's price as a safety net:**  Bob can always switch to John if the negotiation fails, so there's no immediate pressure to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a little high for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $107.50?  This is a fair price that gets us both closer to what we want."", ""product_price"": 107.50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing negotiation:**  Bob is showing persistence and continuing to try and lower the price.
* **Splitting the difference:** This approach is often seen as fair, as it suggests both parties are making a compromise.
* **Realistic offer:**  $107.50 is a reasonable middle ground between Bob's last offer and Alice's latest offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle. However, $107.50 is still a little too low for me. Let's try $112.50.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and it gets us closer to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above value:** Alice's offer of $112.50 is still above Bob's maximum value of $100. 
* **Potential for agreement:** While Alice has increased her price, there's still room for further negotiation.  
* **John's price as a backup:** Bob can still purchase from John for $100, giving him a strong bargaining position. 
* **Strategy:** By rejecting and continuing to counteroffer, Bob can try to push Alice closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $112.50 is still too much for me. Let's try $109.  It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to an agreement. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 109} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Persistence:** Bob continues to negotiate despite Alice increasing the price, demonstrating his commitment to getting a lower price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $109 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $111.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and gets us closer to an agreement.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $111. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $111
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above value:**  $111 is still above Bob's maximum value of $100.
* **Pressure to close:** Alice is pushing to close the deal, but Bob has John as a backup.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  There's still a small gap between their offers, suggesting that a compromise might be possible with further negotiation.
* **Strategy:**  Bob can use this opportunity to attempt one more counteroffer, potentially pushing Alice to his target price or triggering a purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down.  $111 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $110?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and I'm confident we can close the deal.  Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Last Stand:** This is likely Bob's final counteroffer before resorting to John.

* **Positive tone:**  The message emphasizes the potential for closing the deal, urging Alice to make a final decision.
* **Strategic move:**  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can confidently go to John, knowing he's gotten the best possible deal from Alice."
