Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A price of $175 is a reasonable markup from your minimum and isn't so high that it would immediately scare Bob away. 
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward and emphasizes the potential value to Bob. 
 
**Important Note:**  There's a balance to strike. A very high offer might make Bob decline, while a low offer might leave money on the table. This strategy aims for a profitable outcome."
