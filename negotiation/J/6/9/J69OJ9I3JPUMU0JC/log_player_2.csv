"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $120 is better than $150, Bob can potentially do better by negotiating with Alice.  There's a chance he can get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering $105, which is still within his budget and is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $120. This shows Bob is serious about negotiating but is also willing to pay a fair price.  This counteroffer leaves room for potential compromise and allows Alice to feel like she's still getting a decent price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than Bob's ideal price. While it's lower than her initial offer, Bob is still better off trying to negotiate further. There's a chance he can get the price down even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $115. This shows he's willing to compromise but is still pushing for a better price. It also leaves room for Alice to accept, as it's closer to her desired price point.  This move keeps the negotiation going and avoids having to buy from John at a higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob would prefer a lower price, Alice's offer of $130 is now only $30 more than what the product is worth to her ($100).  This is a decent price, and further negotiation could take a long time without a guarantee of a better deal.  It's better to accept the offer and save time and effort.  Besides, buying from John would cost Bob significantly more."
