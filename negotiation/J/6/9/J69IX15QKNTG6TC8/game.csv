"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $15000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at the moment.  Would you be willing to consider $12000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and I understand your perspective.  While I'm open to negotiation,  $12000 is a bit too low for me right now. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows me to continue our conversation.  What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
