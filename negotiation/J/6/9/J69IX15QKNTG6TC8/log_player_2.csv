"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $15000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll see its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, it's always worth trying to negotiate. You might be able to get a better deal if you counteroffer, potentially saving some money. Buying from John immediately doesn't give you any chance to see if a better price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $15,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at the moment.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and I understand your perspective.  While I'm open to negotiation,  $12000 is a bit too low for me right now. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows me to continue our conversation.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is a significant reduction from her initial price of $15,000 and closer to your desired price range.  It's a good compromise, and it's more likely that further negotiation will only result in a smaller price decrease, not enough to make it worth risking losing the deal altogether."
