"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $110. This is a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $110 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  Your goal is to save as much money as possible, so buying from John is the most financially sensible choice."
