Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the value in your product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while giving you a good return on your investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit outside of my comfort zone. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise and a good step towards reaching an agreement. Let's find a solution that benefits us both.
