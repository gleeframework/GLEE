{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still a bit high. You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  Since I'm aiming to save as much money as possible, I'll continue negotiating to see if I can secure a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  $110 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference at $107.50?  I'm really keen on getting this product, but that's the absolute highest I can go."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
