"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $145. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm counteroffering with $160. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. It still allows me to make a profit, but is more appealing to Bob than my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $155. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal for me and allows me to avoid risking a further negotiation that could result in a lower price or even a rejection.  It's also better than selling to John for $150."
