"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. Is this something you'd be interested in?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit high for me.  How about $105?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. It's a fair price considering the value it will bring to you.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference -  how about $115?  I'm sure you'll still make a good profit at that price, and it would be a great deal for me.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to negotiate further, Bob. I can do $122, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. It's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while to sell the product to you.",122.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  How about we meet in the middle at $118?  It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be a great addition to my collection.",118.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum, Bob. I can do $119, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great price for you, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",119.0,Alice,7,
