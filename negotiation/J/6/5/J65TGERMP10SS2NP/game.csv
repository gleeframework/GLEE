"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at over a million dollars to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $900,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price significantly below its true worth.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $850,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial limitations. While I value this product at significantly more, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle. I'll accept $875,000. This offer still allows me to recover a substantial portion of the value, while providing you with a fair price.  What do you say?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal carefully. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm still unable to meet you at $875,000. My maximum offer remains at $850,000. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
