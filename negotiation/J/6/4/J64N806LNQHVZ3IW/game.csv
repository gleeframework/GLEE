"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still leaves you a healthy profit. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and the potential for you to find a buyer closer to your asking price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $950,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference and see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair compromise.  It's a significant amount, and it allows you to get closer to your desired price.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's go with $925,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly.  What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,5,
