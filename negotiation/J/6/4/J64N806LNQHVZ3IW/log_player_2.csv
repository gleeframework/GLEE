# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still leaves you a healthy profit. What do you say?

Alice's offer:

While Alice has lowered her price again, it's still above your target of $800,000. It's possible that you could continue negotiating with Alice, but you risk the deal falling apart. You're better off buying the product from John for $800,000, guaranteeing you get the product within your budget."
