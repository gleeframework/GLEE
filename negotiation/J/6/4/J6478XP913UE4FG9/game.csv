"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to secure this product at a price that's more in line with my budget. Considering its value to me and your desire for a mutually beneficial deal, I'm proposing a price of $850000. This offer allows for a significant profit margin for you while still being within my financial constraints. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm happy to work with you, $850000 falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to lower my price to $900000. This offer still provides you with a significant value proposition, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",900000.0,Alice,3,
