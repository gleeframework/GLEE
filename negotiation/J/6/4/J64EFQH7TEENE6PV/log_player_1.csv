Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $174. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 174}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I want to start by aiming for a price higher than what Bob values the product at. This leaves room for negotiation or a pleasant surprise if he accepts outright. 
* **Not Too High:** While I could go much higher, there's a risk of alienating Bob and making him less likely to negotiate. A price of $174 is significantly more than his perceived value but not ridiculously high.
* **Leaving Room:** If Bob counters, I can always negotiate down towards his $100 valuation, knowing I have a safety net with John. 

This strategy maximizes my potential profit while still giving Bob a chance to buy the product."
