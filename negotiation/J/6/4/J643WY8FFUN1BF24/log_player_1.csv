{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $130 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. By offering $130, I'm aiming for a price that is a good compromise between my minimum value of $100 and Bob's potential value of $150. I'm also including a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy allows for potential negotiation while still leaving me with a comfortable profit if Bob accepts the initial offer. If he rejects it, I'm prepared to engage in further negotiation or to sell the product to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it's still below my minimum value of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to go up to $115? It's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm increasing the price slightly, but staying below Bob's perceived value of $150.  This allows for further negotiation while still giving me a profit margin. The message emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, hoping to incentivize him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get a fair price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is above my minimum value of $100 and is a fair compromise.  Accepting this offer ensures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for a lower price."
