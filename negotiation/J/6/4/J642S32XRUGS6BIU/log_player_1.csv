"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1100000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  This gives us room to negotiate, but I want to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $950,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $800,000.  I have room to negotiate further, and I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,050,000. This is still a good price for me, as it's above my minimum, and it leaves room for further negotiation if Bob still wants to bargain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $980,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm confident that I can get more, given Bob's interest and our remaining negotiation rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1020000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,020,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer but still comfortably above my minimum desired price.  I'm trying to find a middle ground while still securing a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get a bit more, Bob's offer of $995,000 is very close to my minimum desired price, and we only have 4 rounds left.  I'm not willing to risk losing this deal by pushing for more."
