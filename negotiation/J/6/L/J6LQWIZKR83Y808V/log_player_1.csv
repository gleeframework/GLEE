Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale of $1,200,000 from John.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 leaves little room for Bob to see value.  Offering too low risks him rejecting the offer.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for your operations, potentially even more than my asking price. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This represents a substantial saving compared to its true worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Target Price:** $1,350,000 is a good starting point. It's a $150,000 profit for you (above your guarantee) and a $150,000 saving for Bob.
* **Messaging:**  The message focuses on the value proposition for Bob, emphasizing the potential savings. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher to allow room for negotiation.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good long-term relationship with Bob is crucial, a slightly lower price might be strategic.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and have a negotiation strategy in place!"
