"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this product, but I have to be honest with you, I'm looking to make a profit, so I'm thinking of selling it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum price and higher than what John is offering. It makes the most sense to go directly to John."
