Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really trying to make a deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. How about we meet at $10,200? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is slowly coming down, the negotiations are moving too slowly.  At this point, it's unlikely Alice will agree to a price significantly lower than $10,000.  Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to cut his losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $10,000 price."
