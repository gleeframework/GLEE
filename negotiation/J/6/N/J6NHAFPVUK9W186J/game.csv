"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we start at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you consider $9,000?  I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,000 just yet. How about we compromise at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close!  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $9,500.  That's a significant jump from my previous offer, and I think it demonstrates my serious interest.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're really trying to make a deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. How about we meet at $10,200?",10200.0,Alice,7,
