"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm starting with an offer of $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and positive message to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm not setting a hard line, but leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget while giving me the best chance to get a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product you're selling, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $14500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** While $14,500 is tempting, it's still within the range where I believe I can get a better price. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Bob has shown interest and acknowledged the value of the product, which means there's likely room for me to get a higher price.
* **Time is on my side:**  I have 8 rounds left, and I'm not in a rush to sell to John.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially earn more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a little closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to come down to $14,750. Let's see if we can find a compromise!"", ""product_price"": 14750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Incentive:** My counteroffer shows flexibility by lowering the price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Moderate Reduction:** I'm only lowering the price by $250, which sends the message that I'm serious about getting a good price while also leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and encouraging tone can help keep the negotiations productive. 

I believe this counteroffer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I would like to propose a price of $14600 for the product. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $14,600 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Time constraint:** We're already in round 4, and with 6 rounds left, I need to be cautious about letting the negotiation drag on too long.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While this offer is close to my limit, I can potentially get more if I can secure a deal with Bob now. 

I believe accepting this offer will be the best option for maximizing my profit and keeping the negotiation moving forward."
