"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense potential and value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the potential. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is below my bottom line.  I'm confident this product will bring you significant returns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This would still provide you with a healthy profit, and it's a price I can comfortably work with. Let's try to find a solution that benefits us both.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts in this negotiation, but we seem to be at an impasse. While I believe in the value this product offers you, I also have other interested buyers.  My final offer is $1,100,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and reflects my strong desire to do business with you.  If this doesn't work, I'm afraid I'll need to pursue other opportunities.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
