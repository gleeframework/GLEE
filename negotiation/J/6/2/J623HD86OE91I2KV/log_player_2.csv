Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued engagement, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. In consideration of your latest offer, I am prepared to accept a price of $1075000 for the product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is very close to your last counteroffer of $1,050,000.  Accepting this offer means you get the product for a price that's within your budget and significantly lower than John's price. Further negotiation might be possible, but the potential savings are small compared to the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
