"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its potential and worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the substantial benefits you'll reap."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $1,000,000 is a significant sum, I know the product is worth considerably more to Bob. Rejecting this offer allows me to maintain a stronger negotiating position and potentially secure a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but $1,000,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  Let's meet halfway - I propose $1,150,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Conceding Ground:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer to show flexibility and keep the negotiation moving.
* **Holding Firm:** The $1,150,000 price point still keeps me above the midpoint between our initial offers, preserving the potential for a higher profit.
* **Clear Justification:** By emphasizing the product's value and my own compromise, I'm aiming to encourage Bob to make a more substantial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I would like to counteroffer at $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,100,000 is a substantial profit margin, well above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating a strong desire for the product.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but there's also a risk that Bob could lower his offer or walk away. Accepting now secures a great deal."
