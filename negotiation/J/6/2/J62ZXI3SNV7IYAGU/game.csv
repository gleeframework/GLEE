"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the value I see in the product, I'm willing to offer you $700,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its true value.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $850,000. This feels like a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,4,
