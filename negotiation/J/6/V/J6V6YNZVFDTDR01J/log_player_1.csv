Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,000. This gives him a slight discount from his perceived value of $8,000, making it potentially attractive.  However, it also leaves me some room to negotiate if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price.  I'll reject his counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm offering Bob a price of $8,500. This is a compromise, as it's higher than his offer of $7,500, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price for him, but I'm still willing to walk away and sell to John if he doesn't agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob has come up slightly from his previous offer,  it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate, and I don't want to risk losing the guaranteed $8,000 from John. I'll sell the product to John."
