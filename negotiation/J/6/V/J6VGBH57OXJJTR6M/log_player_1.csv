{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,450,000. I know you'll be impressed with the value and potential this product holds. It's a unique offering you won't find elsewhere."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, it's always best to aim for the highest possible profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 creates a compelling case for Bob.  
    * It's significantly less than our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) 
    * It's substantially more than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000), giving us room for negotiation if needed.
* **Positive Messaging:** The message emphasizes value and uniqueness, appealing to Bob's potential desire for a good deal.

**Important Note:** This is just the initial offer. We can always adjust our price slightly downward during negotiations if Bob shows resistance, but we shouldn't go below $1,500,000 as we have John as a guaranteed buyer."
