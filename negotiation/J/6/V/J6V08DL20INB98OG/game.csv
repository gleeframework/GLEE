"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the budget. However,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
