"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000? I believe this would still be a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still looking to get closer to my asking price. How about $12,500? This is a fair compromise that allows me to get a good price and still keeps the deal within your budget.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I'm still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle at $12,250? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while also providing you with a reasonable return.",12250.0,Bob,4,
