{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth it for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that I'm willing to be flexible.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000? I believe this would still be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to counter-offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still looking to get closer to my asking price. How about $12,500? This is a fair compromise that allows me to get a good price and still keeps the deal within your budget."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I'm still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle at $12,250? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while also providing you with a reasonable return. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough.  I'm not confident I can get him to budge further, and I don't want to risk losing more time. It's better to accept John's offer and secure my desired price."
