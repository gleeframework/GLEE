"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its high value and the fact that it's worth $12,000 to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects both its quality and your needs. Considering the exceptional benefits it offers, I suggest we aim for a price closer to $11,000. This still leaves room for negotiation while ensuring a fair transaction for both parties. Let's schedule a call to delve deeper into this opportunity and explore how we can make this work for everyone involved. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Your Maximum:** You're willing to pay up to $12,000.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering $11,000. 
* **Alternative:**  You can buy from John for $12,000.

Since you can get the product for your maximum price from John, rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with John or use the threat of buying from John to get a better deal from Alice."
