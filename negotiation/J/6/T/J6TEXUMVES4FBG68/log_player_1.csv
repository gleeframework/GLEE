Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $700,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $700,000 is a bit low, I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to facilitate the deal. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is still a little high for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While $775,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold.  John is a sure thing at $800,000, so I'm going to sell the product to him."
