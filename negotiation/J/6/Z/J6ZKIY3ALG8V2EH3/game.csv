"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to discuss this product. However, $12,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm open to negotiation, but this is the highest I can go.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $9,000, which is a fair compromise. I believe this price reflects the value of the product to both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see that we're getting closer to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",9500.0,Alice,5,
