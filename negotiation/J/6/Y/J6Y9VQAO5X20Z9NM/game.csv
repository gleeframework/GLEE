"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer,  $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on this asset. ",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which I believe is a fair price given the product's value to me and my willingness to close this deal.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement on this.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
