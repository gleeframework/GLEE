"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. This is a fantastic deal for something with such immense value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that asking price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to start the conversation at $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm confident it can generate significant returns for you. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This offer reflects the product's inherent value and provides a fair outcome for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still a big gap for me. To be frank, I'm working with a budget, and anything above $900,000 will be tough.  How about we meet in the middle at that price?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. Let's make this simple: $1,100,000, and we have a deal. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stuck at a price point that's not beneficial for you.  Her ""final offer"" and mention of another buyer are likely negotiation tactics. You have a guaranteed option with John at a better price. It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and buy from John."
