"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $1,350,000? It's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's try to close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While I would like to purchase the product, I am still unable to meet your current offer at $1,350,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,335,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us. What do you think?",1335000.0,Alice,5,
