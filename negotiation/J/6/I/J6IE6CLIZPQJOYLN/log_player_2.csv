# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price that's fair to both of us. It's a unique opportunity for you, as this product is worth significantly more to you than to others.  Let's discuss a price that makes sense for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
