"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $120.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $150? It's still a great deal for you, and it's the minimum I'm willing to accept.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $150 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to pay $130. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my limit.  What do you think?",130.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. How about we compromise at $140? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still a bit too high.  I can go up to $135, which is still a fair price for both of us.   Let's see if we can close the deal on this.",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $140 was still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $135. How about we meet again at $138? It's still a good deal for you, and it's getting closer to my minimum price.",138.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I'm willing to go up to $137, but I'm not sure I can go higher.  Let's see if we can finalise this deal.",137.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $138 was still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $137. How about we meet again at $139? It's still a good deal for you, and it's getting closer to my minimum price.",139.0,Alice,9,
