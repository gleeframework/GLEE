"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a fair and reasonable offer of $700,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $675,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $675,000 is a good price for the product, saving him $125,000 compared to buying from John.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll end up having to buy from John at a higher price."
