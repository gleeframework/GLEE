"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired value in the coming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping to find a compromise in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's significantly higher than what I'd get from John, and we're getting closer to the middle ground.  There's a chance we could continue negotiating, but it's risky to keep going with so few rounds left."
