Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to the value Bob places on the product, giving him a small incentive to accept. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  Leaving room for negotiation allows me to potentially reach a price closer to my desired outcome. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** The existence of John, willing to pay $8,000, gives me a safety net. If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to pay closer to $9,000. I know it's worth more to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $8,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob is willing to negotiate and acknowledges the product's value to him. This indicates there's potential to reach a more favorable price. 
* **Counteroffer is a better strategy:** By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, I can try to push the price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer closer to my minimum:**  $10,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but closer to my desired $8,000 minimum.
* **Focus on the value for Bob:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he places on the product and highlighting that even at $10,000, it's a good deal for him.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  Keeping the conversation positive and encouraging helps to maintain a good rapport and potentially lead to a successful agreement."
