Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really like. I'm offering it to you for $150. It's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Could you consider reducing the price to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is already at his maximum valuation for the product.  There's no point in further negotiation as it will only result in me getting $100 or less. I'll take the guaranteed $100 from John."
