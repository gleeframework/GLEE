"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're willing to pay a bit more, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $13,500? I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to ensure I get a good deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,500 is still a little out of my range. Let's split the difference. I'll offer you $13,000. It's a good price for both of us.  I'm confident we can find an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to split the difference, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $13,500, which would be $13,250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",13250.0,Alice,7,
