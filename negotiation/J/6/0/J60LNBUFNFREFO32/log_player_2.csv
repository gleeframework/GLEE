"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above Bob's budget. While it is a compromise, it's still not a good deal for Bob. He's better off continuing to negotiate to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're willing to pay a bit more, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $13,500? I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to ensure I get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above Bob's budget, but it is getting closer.  Since Bob has already rejected offers that were even higher, it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price.  He might be able to get a deal closer to his $12,000 counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,500 is still a little out of my range. Let's split the difference. I'll offer you $13,000. It's a good price for both of us.  I'm confident we can find an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to split the difference, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $13,500, which would be $13,250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $13,250 is still above Bob's budget of $10,000. While the negotiation is getting closer, it's starting to take more rounds than Bob would like.  He's already made a counteroffer that Alice has rejected.  It's becoming increasingly likely that Alice will continue to reject offers closer to Bob's budget.  To avoid further rounds of negotiation and ensure he gets the product within his budget, Bob should buy from John."
