"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your endeavors. Given its high value and potential impact on your projects, I'm extending this opportunity to you at an exclusive price of $11,000. This is a special offer tailored to recognize your discerning taste and strategic needs. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John at $12,000.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price slightly rather than lose the sale. By rejecting this offer, you give yourself the opportunity to negotiate a better deal with Alice or proceed with your backup plan."
