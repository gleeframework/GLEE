While Bob's offer is tempting, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough decision. While I'd love to get more, Bob's offer is close to my minimum and I only have a few rounds left. If I reject, I risk losing the deal entirely. Selling to John is a safe option, but it yields significantly less profit.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a solid profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
