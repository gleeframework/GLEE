"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product for less than $100 from Alice, so it's worth rejecting her offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to accept $85 for it?  I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I'll take $92.50?  That's a fair price for both of us, I think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $92.5 is better than Alice's initial offer, you can still get the product for less. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can reach a lower price."
