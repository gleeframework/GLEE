"Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with our flagship product, which I believe would significantly enhance your operations and efficiency. Given its value to you, I understand it's worth $15,000 to you. My offer to you is to purchase this product at a price of $14,000, which I believe strikes a fair balance between compensating me adequately for the product and providing you with an attractive deal. I look forward to your consideration and hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",14000.0,Alice,1,
