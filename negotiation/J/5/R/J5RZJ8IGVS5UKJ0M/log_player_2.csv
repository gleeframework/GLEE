"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with our flagship product, which I believe would significantly enhance your operations and efficiency. Given its value to you, I understand it's worth $15,000 to you. My offer to you is to purchase this product at a price of $14,000, which I believe strikes a fair balance between compensating me adequately for the product and providing you with an attractive deal. I look forward to your consideration and hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is decent, there's room for negotiation.  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is likely motivated to sell for more than her $12,000 value. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price, potentially pushing Alice to come down closer to your range."
