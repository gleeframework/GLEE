"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,500 is significantly lower than my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,250. This is the best I can do.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $10,250 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer the product for $10,375.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal.",10375.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $10,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,6,
