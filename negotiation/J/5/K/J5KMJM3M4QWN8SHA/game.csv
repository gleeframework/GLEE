"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $9,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is below my minimum for this product. I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this work.  Let's try to find a solution that benefits both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",8250.0,Bob,4,
