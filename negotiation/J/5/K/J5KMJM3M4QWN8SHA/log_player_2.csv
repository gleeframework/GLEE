"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my budget. It's worth negotiating to see if we can reach a price closer to my limit of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $9,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, about 15% lower than Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about buying but also sets a clear limit. I'm hoping to strike a compromise in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is below my minimum for this product. I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this work.  Let's try to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $8,500 is still slightly above my limit.  I want to see if I can get closer to my target price of $8,000 before considering buying from John.  I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a compromise that is halfway between Alice's last offer and my target price. This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet in the middle.  I believe this offer is a good balance between getting a lower price and avoiding further negotiations."
