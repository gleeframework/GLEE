"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, given its value to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $11,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price. It's possible Alice is willing to come down a bit further. If not, Bob can always buy from John for $10,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
