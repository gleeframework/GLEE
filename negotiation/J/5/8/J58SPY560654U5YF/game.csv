"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and what I'm willing to pay for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  The value this product brings is truly substantial. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I still think $1,250,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not willing to go higher. I'd like to propose $1,250,000 as the price for the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
