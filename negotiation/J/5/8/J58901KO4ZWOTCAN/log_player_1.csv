"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation, as it's still below my minimum acceptable price. This allows Bob to feel like he has some leverage, encouraging him to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This is a more reasonable price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my ideal outcome.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to what I'm aiming for."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,200,000. This is a fair price for both of us, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle. I believe I can push for a slightly higher price and still close the deal with Bob. I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $1,225,000? This is a very fair price, considering the value of the product to you.  I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1225000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000. This is the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting too low for my liking.  While I could counter again, I'm running out of rounds and the potential for a successful deal is dwindling.  To guarantee my minimum, I'm going to sell the product to John."
