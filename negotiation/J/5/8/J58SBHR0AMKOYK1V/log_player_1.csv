Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,999. I think it's a great deal and I'm hoping you'll find it valuable as well."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible since I have a guaranteed buyer in John. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a price very close to my bottom line gives me room to negotiate if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Psychological Pricing:** The $14,999 price point seems more appealing and ""deal-like"" than a flat $15,000.

While there's a chance Bob might accept immediately, this strategy aims for the highest possible profit while still making the offer appear attractive."
