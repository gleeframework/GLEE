"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this item and I believe it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $180, which I think is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I'm looking for something within my budget. Could we discuss a price closer to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is already at his maximum valuation. There's no room for negotiation to get a better price. Accepting his offer gets me the same as John's offer.  I'll sell to John."
