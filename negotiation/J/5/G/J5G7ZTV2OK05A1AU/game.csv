"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $140? It's still a good deal for both of us, and it's closer to my minimum price.",140.0,Alice,3,
