Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly more than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter.  I'll keep an eye on the situation and if things stall, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for your product. This price is fair to both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter with a slightly higher price, keeping in mind that I can always sell to John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $9,500? This still gives you a great deal on the product, and it's a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 9500}
