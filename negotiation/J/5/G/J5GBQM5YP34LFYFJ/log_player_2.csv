"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** It's better than buying from John, but there's still room for negotiation.
* **You can potentially save more money.** By rejecting the offer, you can try to get Alice to lower the price. 
* **You have no risk.**  If the negotiations fail, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for your product. This price is fair to both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $9,500? This still gives you a great deal on the product, and it's a fair price for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is close to my target.** I'm aiming to save as much money as possible, and $9,500 is a good compromise.
* **There's a risk of losing the deal.** If I reject this offer and make another counteroffer, there's a chance Alice will walk away or stick to her price. 
* **The price is still better than John's.**  Buying from Alice for $9,500 saves me $2,500 compared to John."
