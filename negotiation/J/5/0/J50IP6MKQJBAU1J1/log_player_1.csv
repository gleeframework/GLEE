"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate down while still securing a profit well above my minimum.  I'm hoping to leverage the fact that he has a need for the product and push him to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a good price, I'm not yet satisfied.  I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $1,750,000. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, seeing if I can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, considering his value for the product is $800,000. This offer is still significantly higher than his last offer, but it shows I am willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my minimum. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go that low. It's more profitable to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, which is a much better deal considering my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000."
