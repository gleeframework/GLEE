Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $10,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no reason to offer the product to Bob for less. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at your desired price allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially offering a slightly lower amount while still exceeding your minimum. 
* **Direct Approach:** The message is clear and concise, conveying value while also making Bob aware this is a time-sensitive opportunity."
