"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's true value is $1,500,000 to you. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's below your maximum, it's still significantly higher than Alice's valuation. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You have 10 rounds, so you have time to try and get a better price.

**Next Steps:**  You'll need to craft a counteroffer in the next round that is more appealing to you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering your valuation of the product, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering the product's value to me is still $1,000,000, I'm going to counter with a price of $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.**  While it's closer to your desired price, it's still above your ideal price point and leaves a substantial profit margin for Alice.
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  You've only had three rounds, and there are 7 remaining. This is enough time to try and push for a lower price.

**Next Steps:** You should counter with a slightly higher price than your previous offer, but still lower than Alice's offer, to show you're willing to compromise but still want a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000, which reflects a good compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,125,000. Considering the value I place on it, I'm going to counter with a price of $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.** Although she's moved slightly closer to your preferred price, it's still above what you're willing to pay.
* **You have time to negotiate.** You're only halfway through the rounds, and there's still potential to get a lower price.

**Next Steps:** 
You should continue to counteroffer with a price slightly lower than Alice's offer, but higher than your previous offer. This shows you're willing to compromise but still value a good deal. Aim for a price closer to $1,125,000, if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,175,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise given our respective valuations. Let's close this deal and move on."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,150,000. Considering the value I place on it, I'm going to counter with a price of $1,165,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,165,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,165,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While she's coming down in price, it's still above your ideal range.
* **You have limited time remaining.** You're nearing the end of the negotiation process, so it's important to get the best deal possible.
* **You have an alternative.**  You can still buy from John, although it's a higher price.

**Next Steps:** You should counteroffer with a price that is closer to your desired price point. Since time is running out, you may want to make a more aggressive counteroffer than before. You could try offering $1,140,000 or even $1,135,000, but be prepared to potentially walk away and buy from John if Alice doesn't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,165,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Given our negotiations, I'm willing to go up to $1,140,000, which is a very fair price considering the value we both place on this product. It's the best I can offer. If we can't reach an agreement here, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1140000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,140,000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. Considering the value I place on it, I'm going to counter with a price of $1,155,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,155,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,155,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out.** This is the penultimate round, and you only have one more chance to negotiate with Alice.
* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she's moving in the right direction, $1,155,000 is still more than you're comfortable paying.
* **The risk of losing a good deal is too high.** If you reject Alice's offer, you risk her coming back with an even higher price or even walking away entirely.

**Next Steps:**  It's better to secure the product from John, even at the higher price, than risk ending up with nothing. You've already tried to get a better deal from Alice, but she's clearly not willing to go lower."
