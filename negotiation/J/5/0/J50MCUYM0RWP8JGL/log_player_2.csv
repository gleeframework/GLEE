Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can meet you halfway at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. Is this a more acceptable offer for you?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $762,500. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $795,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the value the product brings to your business.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $778,750. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer, and I'll meet you at $795,000, but I need to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I'm willing to throw in some additional support and maintenance services for the product, which I value at $12,500. So, I'll offer the product to you for $807,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the additional services offered. To be fair, those services are valuable, but not $12,500 valuable to me.  I'm willing to meet your final offer with one of my own:  $795,000 for the product and the additional services."", ""product_price"": 795000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the value of the additional services. However, I'm not willing to go back to the original price of $795,000 without the services. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your counteroffer. I'll sell the product and the services to you for $800,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,250. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly holding firm at a price point very close to her value for the product.  While her negotiation tactics have been fair, she's unlikely to move significantly from her last offer.  At this point, cutting losses and buying from John for $1,000,000 makes more sense than potentially wasting more time and risking a higher final price from Alice."
