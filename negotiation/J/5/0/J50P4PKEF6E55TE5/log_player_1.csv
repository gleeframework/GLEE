{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's in great condition and I think you'll really enjoy it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'll see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a good offer, I'm still looking for a bit more. How about $110? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

I'm offering a price that's still above Bob's initial offer, but closer to his perceived value.  I hope this will encourage him to accept, but I'm still leaving room to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $110. How about we meet in the middle at $105? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum of $120.  Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price, I'm going to take John's offer and sell to him for $120."
