"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9000? This still leaves you with a $3000 profit, and it's a fair price for me. Let's seal the deal!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
