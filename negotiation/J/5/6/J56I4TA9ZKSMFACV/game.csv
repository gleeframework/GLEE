"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still leaves some room for me to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still too low for me.  Considering the product's value, I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This is my final offer. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll have to move on to other interested buyers. ",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is the price I was initially considering from John. I'm really interested in the product, and I think this is a fair price. Can you consider this offer?",10000.0,Bob,6,
