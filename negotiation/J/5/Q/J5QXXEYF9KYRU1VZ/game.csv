,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think your asking price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you're offering, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,400,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still reflects the significant value this product offers, and it's a fair compromise. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,520,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you're offering, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",1520000.0,Bob,4,
