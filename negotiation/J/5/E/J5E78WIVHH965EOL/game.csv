"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable item. I believe you'll find it to be a great addition to your collection. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit steep for me right now.  Could we consider something around $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to negotiate, but I'm afraid $650,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we try a price of $725,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're still interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $725,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll compromise at $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate with me.  While I think $950,000 is closer to a fair deal, I'm still not quite there.  Would you consider $800,000? I believe that's a fair offer for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $800,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last offer, but I need to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is the lowest I can go. If you're still interested, this is my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
