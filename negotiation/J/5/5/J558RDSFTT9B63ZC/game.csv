"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,200,000 is still significantly below my desired price.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you the product for $1,300,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  While $1,250,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000? This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
