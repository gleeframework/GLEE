"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're on a budget, Bob. However, I've received interest from other buyers, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product. Can you consider that?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $11500 is a fair price for the product, Bob. I've done some research and I know that similar products are selling for higher prices. I'm willing to meet you at $12200, but that's as low as I can go.",12200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've done research on similar products, but I'm still not convinced that this product is worth $12200. I'm willing to pay $11800 for the product. Can you consider that?",11800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already told you, Bob, that I'm not willing to go below $12200. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession: I'll meet you at $12000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I've heard enough of your'minimum prices' and 'concessions'. I'm willing to walk away from this deal if I don't get a better price. I'll give you one last chance to sell me the product for $11500. If I don't get that, I'll buy it from John for $12000 and you'll be left with a product you can't sell.",11500.0,Bob,8,
