"I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're interested.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, but I can't go any lower.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I can meet you in the middle at $950,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with your offer.  While I value our ongoing negotiation,  $950,000 is still a bit too low.  To make this work, I'm willing to lower my price to $975,000. This is a final offer, as I'm also considering other opportunities.  What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $975,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $960,000, but that's my final offer. Can you consider that?",960000.0,Bob,6,
