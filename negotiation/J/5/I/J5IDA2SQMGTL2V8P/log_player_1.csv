{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point because it's halfway between my minimum acceptable price ($80) and Bob's perceived value ($100).  It leaves room for negotiation while also giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to accept $85, it's only slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'd prefer to try and get closer to my desired price of $95. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? I'm sure we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counteroffering with $90. This is still a good price for Bob since it's significantly lower than his perceived value of $100, and it's also a reasonable compromise considering my previous offer of $95. This hopefully encourages Bob to accept the offer while still allowing me to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your offer, but $90 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $87.50. This is a good deal for me, as it's significantly higher than the price John is willing to pay ($80). While I initially wanted to get $95, it seems like Bob is not willing to go any higher, and I'd rather secure a sale than risk losing him completely and having to sell to John for a lower price."
