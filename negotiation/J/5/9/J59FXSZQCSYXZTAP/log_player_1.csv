Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is still a substantial investment for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $1200000 is still outside my price range.  I'm prepared to offer $900000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
