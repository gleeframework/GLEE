"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $12,000 is good, Bob can likely do better. There are 9 more rounds, and Bob can counteroffer to try and get a lower price.  Buying from John immediately would cost more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, aiming to get a price closer to his target of saving as much money as possible.  $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob and gives Alice some room to negotiate.  It's important to start negotiations strong, but not too aggressively."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still better than buying from John, but Bob can likely get a lower price.  He's already made a counteroffer, and there's a chance Alice will come down further.  There's still time to negotiate and hopefully get the price down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly from the previous round, showing he's willing to meet Alice halfway. This suggests a willingness to negotiate seriously while still trying to get a good price. Alice has already rejected a lower offer, so there's a chance she'll see this as a fair compromise. It's a calculated risk, but one that could lead to a quicker deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but Bob is still hoping to get a better deal.  He can afford to reject this offer and continue negotiating, as there are still five rounds left.  It's still worth trying to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again,  demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This offer is right at the middle point between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  He is showing a willingness to meet in the middle, hoping to close the deal.  It's a strong move, but he's still leaving room for further negotiations if necessary."
