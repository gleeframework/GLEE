Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $10,000 to me, I'll make an offer that's slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 12,000}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, so now I need to decide what to do. Since Bob's offer is $10,000, which is the minimum value I'm willing to accept, I think I'll accept his offer. I'll sell the product to Bob for $10,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
