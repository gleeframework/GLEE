"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still securing a good profit. I'm confident he'll counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $950,000 is a good price, I'm confident I can get closer to my ideal price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and agree to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for a better deal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm going to counter with $975,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but still below my initial asking price. I'm hoping this shows flexibility while still securing a good profit. I'm confident Bob will see the value in closing the deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

We're getting close to my minimum price, and Bob is showing signs of not wanting to go much higher. Accepting his offer at $925,000 is a good compromise. I'm securing a decent profit while also getting the deal closed."
