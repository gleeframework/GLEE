"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Considering its significant value, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're aiming to maximize profit and we know Bob values the product highly. Starting high leaves room for negotiation and potentially secures a price closer to Bob's maximum valuation. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's high value without revealing our own minimum price. 
* **Leaving Room:**  The offer leaves a $50,000 margin for Bob to potentially negotiate down, making him feel like he's getting a deal.

We'll adjust our strategy based on Bob's response in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting as it's significantly above our minimum, we still have room to negotiate and several rounds left.  We'll aim to guide the price closer to $1,150,000. Selling to John is our backup plan if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. After careful consideration, I'm willing to come down slightly. Let's settle on $1,135,000. This reflects the product's true value while still offering you a competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 1135000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're meeting Bob halfway between our previous offer and his counteroffer, demonstrating flexibility while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message subtly reinforces the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Urgency (Slight):**  By suggesting ""settling,"" we're subtly implying this is a strong offer and encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still not convinced that the price is right. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,090,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob's counteroffers are moving down in smaller increments, suggesting we might be nearing his limit.
* **Potential for More:** We still have plenty of rounds left, and giving in now might leave money on the table.
* **John as Backup:** The option to sell to John for $1,000,000 provides a safety net, allowing us to continue negotiating strategically. 

We'll use our next counteroffer to gauge Bob's flexibility. If he doesn't budge significantly in the next round or two, we might consider accepting a price closer to his current offer rather than risking a stalemate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and desire to stay within budget. To find a compromise, I'm willing to accept $1,115,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal. Let me know if this works for you."", 
""product_price"": 1115000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** We're making a significant concession ($20,000), signaling that we're serious about closing the deal.
* **Midpoint:** This price is the exact midpoint between our last offer and his last counteroffer, making it appear fair.
* **Call to Action:** The message directly asks for his decision, creating a sense of urgency.

This offer strategically aims to:

1. **Encourage Bob to accept:** The significant price drop might be enough to persuade him.
2. **Gauge his flexibility:** If he rejects this, it indicates his absolute limit is likely very close to his last offer.

We'll reassess our strategy based on Bob's response in the next round, potentially accepting a price around $1,100,000 to avoid risking the sale altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,080,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob's counteroffers are getting smaller, indicating we're pushing his limit. 
* **Time Value:** We've used half of our rounds, and further haggling might yield only small gains.
* **Profitable Outcome:**  $1,080,000 is a significant profit, $80,000 above our minimum and a decent compromise from our initial offers.

While we could try to squeeze out a bit more, the risk of Bob walking away and the decreasing potential gain makes accepting this offer the most rational decision."
