"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a significant discount to consider it. How about we start the conversation at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. While $800,000 is too low, I'm willing to move significantly from my initial offer. How about we consider $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. If you're serious about making a deal, I could go up to $1,100,000.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is substantial.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,500,000? This is my final offer.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
