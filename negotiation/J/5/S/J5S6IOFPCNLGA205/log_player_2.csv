"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its worth to you is $15,000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $12,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $15,000.  There's a chance you can get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she'll come down further."
