Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you and still a significant profit for me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider coming down to $700,000? That would be a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $700,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $700,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, as you'd be getting the product for less than what it's worth to you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a fair price, and I'm willing to move a bit closer. How about $750,000? That's a significant step from my previous offer and puts us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is tempting, I'm still confident I can get a better price, especially since I'm already above my minimum threshold with John. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that.  However, $750,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
