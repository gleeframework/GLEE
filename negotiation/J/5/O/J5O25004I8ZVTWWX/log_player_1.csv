Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  $9,500 is a good starting point because it allows for potential counteroffers and eventual compromise without dropping below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the product's value to me emphasizes its worth and might encourage Bob to consider a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I believe I can get a better price by counteroffering, as Bob is clearly interested in the product. 
* **Time is on My Side:** I can afford to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer without significantly impacting my timeline."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate.  While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This would still be a good deal for you considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I've lowered my price to $8,500, showing a willingness to negotiate and meet Bob halfway.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping he'll be more receptive to a higher price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone to encourage a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $8,500. How about $8,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $8,250 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, it's still a significant difference. 
* **Time is a Factor:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might take more time and energy, and I'm not confident I can get a price closer to my ideal.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price. This is a safer and more certain option."
