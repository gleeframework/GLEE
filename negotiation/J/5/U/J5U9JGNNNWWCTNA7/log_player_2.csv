{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is a good compromise.  While you might be able to squeeze out a slightly lower price, it's unlikely to be significant enough to justify risking further rounds of negotiation.  You're still getting a good deal and saving $25,000 compared to buying from John."
