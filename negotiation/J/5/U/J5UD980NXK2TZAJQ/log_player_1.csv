Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $800,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that I think is fair to both of us.  I'm asking for $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a great deal for you, but I understand if it's not the right price for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **The Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000, which is a significant markup over my minimum value. This allows for negotiation and gives me room to potentially earn more.
* **The Message:** I've made the message friendly and non-aggressive. It highlights the potential value to Bob, acknowledges my minimum value, and leaves room for him to counter-offer. 
* **The Fallback:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $800,000 from John gives me the confidence to try and get more from Bob. 

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for a higher profit."
