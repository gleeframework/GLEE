"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's always smart to see if you can get a better deal before committing.  Since the product is worth no more than $120 to you, you have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $100?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $110. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved closer to your desired price.  Accepting the offer at $110 saves you $10 compared to buying from John and is a good deal considering your maximum value."
