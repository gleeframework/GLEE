"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you.  I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects the true value you'll gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far above Bob's budget and what he considers the product's worth.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and see if he can negotiate a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds remaining, giving Bob ample opportunity to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but my initial offer reflected the significant value this product brings. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still too high for Bob.  He's trying to get the best possible price, and the negotiation is still early. By rejecting this offer, Bob can continue to push for a lower price.  It's also important to remember that Bob has the option to buy from John at any time for $1,000,000, so he has a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,400,000 is closer, I'm still unable to go that high.  How about we settle on $1,200,000? This price is fair and allows us to both walk away with a successful deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we are getting closer.  Let's make this happen.  How about $1,300,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has signaled this might be her final offer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. He is only $300,000 away from his ideal price of $1,000,000, and rejecting this offer allows him to continue bargaining. Additionally, he has the safety net of buying from John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation falls through."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go to $1,150,000.  This price is fair and allows both of us to make a good deal. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
