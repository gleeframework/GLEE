"Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you.  I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects the true value you'll gain from it.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but my initial offer reflected the significant value this product brings. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,400,000 is closer, I'm still unable to go that high.  How about we settle on $1,200,000? This price is fair and allows us to both walk away with a successful deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we are getting closer.  Let's make this happen.  How about $1,300,000? This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go to $1,150,000.  This price is fair and allows both of us to make a good deal. Let's see if we can make this work.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
