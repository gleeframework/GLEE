"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a very attractive price.  I'm asking $1,100,000.  This is a great opportunity to acquire something truly valuable, and I'm sure we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product, but $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price.  How about $1,050,000? This still gives you a significant value for the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal and avoid any further back and forth.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
