Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
