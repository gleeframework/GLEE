"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $20000 is above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $8000 at this time.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $16000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's worth it. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, $16000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is my maximum budget.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to go up to $11000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,6,
