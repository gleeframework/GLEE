"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your target price of $800,000. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. There's no need to rush into a deal that doesn't benefit you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and it gives you a significant profit as well. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still gives you a significant value for the product and allows me to achieve a more reasonable price. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,000,000 is still higher than your target price. It's worth trying to negotiate further before considering buying from John.  You can likely get a better deal by continuing to counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this work for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $950,000? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to achieve our goals. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to your target price, it's still above your budget. You have a few rounds left and you should try to negotiate further. It's likely you can get a better deal by continuing to counter-offer, and there's always the option of buying from John if you can't reach an agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to be near $1,000,000.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This compromise allows us both to get closer to our desired price point.  Let's work towards a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $937,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to move closer to our desired price points. It's time to finalize this deal, so let's make it happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $937,500 is a more attractive offer than previous rounds, it's still above your target price of $800,000. With a few rounds left, there's still potential to negotiate further. Continuing to counter-offer could lead to a better deal closer to your desired price point. It's also important to remember that you have the option to buy from John at any time for $800,000, so you're not pressured into accepting a deal that's too expensive."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see your willingness to compromise, but $937,500 is still a stretch for my budget. I'm willing to offer $912,500. This is a fair midpoint between our previous offers and gives us both some wiggle room.  Let's try to finalize this deal with a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 912500}
