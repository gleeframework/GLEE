"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and it gives you a significant profit as well. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still gives you a significant value for the product and allows me to achieve a more reasonable price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this work for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $950,000? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to achieve our goals. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to be near $1,000,000.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This compromise allows us both to get closer to our desired price point.  Let's work towards a solution that benefits both of us.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $937,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to move closer to our desired price points. It's time to finalize this deal, so let's make it happen.",937500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see your willingness to compromise, but $937,500 is still a stretch for my budget. I'm willing to offer $912,500. This is a fair midpoint between our previous offers and gives us both some wiggle room.  Let's try to finalize this deal with a mutually beneficial price.",912500.0,Bob,8,
