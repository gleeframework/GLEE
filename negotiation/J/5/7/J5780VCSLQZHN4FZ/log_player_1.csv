"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than what Bob's willing to pay, but still significantly lower than my minimum. This gives us room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the benefits of the deal for both parties.
* **Reasoning:** I provide a brief justification for the price, making it seem more reasonable.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit while still getting a deal done. By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I hope to secure a price closer to my minimum value.  I'm also prepared to accept John's offer if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and it gives you a significant profit as well. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would result in a huge loss for me. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is currently unacceptable, I'm not ready to sell to John just yet.  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to bridge the gap between our current positions. I'll aim for a price closer to my minimum value while still being open to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still gives you a significant value for the product and allows me to achieve a more reasonable price. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving from $1,200,000 to $1,000,000, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:** I reiterate the value proposition for both of us, emphasizing that my offer is still beneficial to Bob.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and collaborative tone, hoping to encourage further negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I believe $1,000,000 is a fair price that allows both of us to gain something.  I'm cautiously optimistic that Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to counter again if necessary. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:**  While Bob has increased his offer, $900,000 is still significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would mean losing a substantial amount of money.
* **Negotiation Continues:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Bob is showing a willingness to move closer to my desired price, and I'm confident I can get a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round. I'll try to bridge the gap further, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000 while being open to compromise.  However, I'm starting to get closer to the point where I might consider selling to John if Bob continues to refuse to meet my minimum requirements."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this work for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $950,000? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to achieve our goals. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm proposing a price in the middle of our current positions, showing my commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Compromise:** I'm emphasizing that my offer is a compromise, highlighting the benefits for both parties.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Bob to consider my proposal.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob.  I'm getting closer to my minimum value, but I'm still willing to negotiate.  However, if Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to be near $1,000,000.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This compromise allows us both to get closer to our desired price point.  Let's work towards a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Insufficient:**  While Bob has shown a willingness to move closer to my desired price, $925,000 is still too far away from my minimum value of $1,500,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a significant financial loss for me.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  However, I'm not ready to give up on Bob yet.  We're nearing the middle ground, and I believe there's still room for further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value.  I'm getting more serious about considering John's offer, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal from Bob. If Bob doesn't significantly increase his offer in the next round, I'll likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $937,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to move closer to our desired price points. It's time to finalize this deal, so let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 937500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between Bob's last offer and my previous counteroffer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and reach a final agreement.
* **Sense of Urgency:** I add a sense of urgency to the message, indicating that it's time to close the deal. This might incentivize Bob to accept the offer.
* **Fair Compromise:** I reiterate that my offer is a fair compromise and that it allows both of us to achieve our goals.

**Strategy:**

This is my final attempt to negotiate with Bob.  If he rejects this offer, I will immediately sell the product to John for $1,500,000. I'm taking a calculated risk, hoping that Bob will accept this final compromise, but I'm prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see your willingness to compromise, but $937,500 is still a stretch for my budget. I'm willing to offer $912,500. This is a fair midpoint between our previous offers and gives us both some wiggle room.  Let's try to finalize this deal with a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Insufficient:**  Bob's offer of $912,500 is still significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial financial loss for me. 
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  We've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to result in a price that's acceptable to me. 
* **Time to Move On:** It's time to move on to my backup option. I've tried my best to negotiate with Bob, but the gap between our desired prices is too wide.  

**Decision:**

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  While I would have preferred to get a higher price from Bob,  it's crucial to protect my financial interests and ensure a profit."
