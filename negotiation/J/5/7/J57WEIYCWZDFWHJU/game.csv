"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least at $95. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $95 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $90, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. $90 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",92.5,Alice,5,
