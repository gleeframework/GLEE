# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $100. It's worth rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least at $95. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice is still above your target price of $80. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $95 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $90, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. $90 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

While $92.5 is closer to your target price, it's still above your maximum of $80. You can get the same product from John for a better price, so it's more beneficial to go with John's offer."
