Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would bring significant value to your operations. I'm willing to make you a special offer at $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's room to negotiate with Bob and potentially earn even more.
* **Strong Opening:**  Starting with $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being a significant profit above Bob's perceived value of $800,000.
* **Exclusivity Appeal:**  Highlighting that this is an exclusive offer before a public listing can create a sense of urgency and value for Bob.

**Important Note:** This assumes no further information about Bob's negotiating style or potential budget.  Depending on the context, a different approach might be more suitable."
