"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a very reasonable price of $13,000.  I think it would be a valuable asset to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's plenty of room to negotiate down towards a price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested, but only if I can get it closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low but Reasonable:**  We start significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leave room for negotiation. $10,000 is a good starting point to gauge how flexible Alice might be.
* **Polite and Expressing Interest:**  We maintain a positive tone and express continued interest in the product. This keeps the negotiation going smoothly.
* **Open-ended Question:** By asking if Alice is ""willing to come down,"" we invite a counteroffer and keep the conversation flowing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  While $10,000 is too low, I can come down to $12,000. That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice came down slightly, $12,000 is still significantly higher than her perceived value of $8,000. 
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:**  Alice using the phrase ""final offer"" is likely a negotiation tactic. It doesn't necessarily mean it's her absolute bottom line. We need to test her resolve.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** We are still well below our maximum budget of $15,000. There's room for a counteroffer to try and get closer to $11,000 without risking the deal too much."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's a fair deal for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counteroffer proposes a compromise by splitting the difference between Alice's last offer ($12,000) and our previous offer ($10,000). 
* **Appealing to Fairness:**  By framing it as a ""fair deal for both of us,"" we try to create a sense of compromise and agreement.
* **Testing the ""Final Offer"":**  This counteroffer will reveal if Alice is truly firm at $12,000 or if she's willing to negotiate further."
