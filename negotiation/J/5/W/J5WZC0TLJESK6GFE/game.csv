"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested, but only if I can get it closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  While $10,000 is too low, I can come down to $12,000. That's my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,3,
