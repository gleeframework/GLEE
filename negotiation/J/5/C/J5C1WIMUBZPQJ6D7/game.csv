"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is well above my budget.  I'm only able to go up to $8,000 right now.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $15,000 is still out of my range. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",11000.0,Bob,4,
