"I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer you the product for $10500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $9000, so I'll make a counteroffer of $9500. Would you be willing to accept this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. However, $9500 is still a bit below my target. I can offer you the product for $10000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it a fair price.",10000.0,Alice,5,
