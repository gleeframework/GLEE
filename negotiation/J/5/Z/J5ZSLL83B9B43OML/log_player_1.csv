Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as much as possible from Bob, knowing you have John as a backup.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120, so offering it above that price is essential.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $135 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Alternative Guarantee:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, you're secure knowing John will buy it for your minimum price."
