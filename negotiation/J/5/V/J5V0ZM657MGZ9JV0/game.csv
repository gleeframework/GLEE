"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective on the value, the product holds significant worth, making $1,050,000 a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about we settle on $1,075,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close.  I'm willing to come down slightly further, but I need to stay above $1,090,000 for this to make sense for me.  How about $1,095,000? This is my final offer.",1095000.0,Alice,5,
