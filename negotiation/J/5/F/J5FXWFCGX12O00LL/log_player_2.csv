"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. I'm willing to start at $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $120 is still above your maximum budget of $80.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer but still acknowledges the value of the product to Alice. It leaves room for negotiation while staying within your budget."

Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. I'd like to counter with an offer of $95 for the product. This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $95 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm happy to compromise and offer $90 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**  You've moved closer to Alice's offer, demonstrating your willingness to compromise. $90 is still within your budget and gives Alice some room to negotiate further without losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm glad we're finding common ground here. I would like to counter with $93 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on it while also considering your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $93 is tempting, you're still within your budget and close to your target price.  It's worth trying to push for a lower price, especially since there's still a significant gap between Alice's price and John's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $93 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to offer $91 for the product.  I'm confident this is a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 91}
```

**Reasoning:**  This offer is a smaller step than the previous one, indicating you're getting closer to a deal. It also keeps the pressure on Alice, encouraging her to consider your final offer and potentially close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $92 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on it while also being mindful of your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $92 is still above your target price of $80, and we are nearing the end of the negotiations.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for a guaranteed price of $80.  You've saved $12 compared to Alice's final offer, making this a better decision."
