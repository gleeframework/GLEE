Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first as a valued potential customer. I think it could really benefit you. I'm asking for $11,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 (John), you want to see if Bob will pay a price closer to your valuation. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $11,000 leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a significant profit if Bob accepts.  
* **Relationship Building:**  The tone of the message aims to be collaborative and positions the offer as beneficial to Bob, potentially increasing his willingness to accept. 
 
**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $11,000. However, this strategy allows Alice to explore the possibility of a higher profit margin before resorting to the guaranteed sale with John."
