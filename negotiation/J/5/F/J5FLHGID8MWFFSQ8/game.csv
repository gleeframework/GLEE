"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While it does seem promising, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000. This feels like a more fair price for both of us, considering the value I place on the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000. I think this is a fair price that balances the value of the product with your budget. I'm not willing to go any lower, but I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
