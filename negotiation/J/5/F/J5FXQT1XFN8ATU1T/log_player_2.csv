"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product.  I'm asking for $14000 for it, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer gives Bob a chance to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit more than I can afford right now.  Would you be willing to do $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12500 is just a bit too low for me right now. How about we split the difference and go with $13250?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $13,250 is lower than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer gives Bob another chance to negotiate a lower price, potentially closer to his desired price."
