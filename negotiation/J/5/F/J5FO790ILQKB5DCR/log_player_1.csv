Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. That's the most I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'd like to close the deal, $100 is too low for me. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $100 is significantly below what I need to get for it.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to what I want, I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $110. I believe I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $105 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference: I'm willing to come down to $107.50. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 107.5}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $106. While it's not ideal, it's getting close to my minimum price.  I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely."
