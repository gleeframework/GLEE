{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also highlights the potential value to Bob.  We'll see how Bob responds and adjust accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. That's still a great price for such a valuable product.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This is the best I can do, let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While it's tempting to try to negotiate further,  it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement that works for both of us.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John and avoid further negotiation headaches."
