# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for this product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. Let's meet in the middle at $15,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $15,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still higher than I'm willing to pay. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $15,000 is still above my budget. I'm happy to pay $13,000, which is a good compromise considering the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway again, Bob. I can offer you the product for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise given the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is still offering a price that is above my budget.  While $14,000 is a better price than before, I've already had several rounds of negotiation, and it's clear that Alice is unwilling to come down much further.  To avoid further haggling, I'll go ahead and buy the product from John for $12,000, saving myself a lot of time and potential headaches."
