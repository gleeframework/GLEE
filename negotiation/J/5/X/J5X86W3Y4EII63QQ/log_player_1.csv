Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price between $8,000 and $15,000 allows for profit. Starting at $12,000 aims for a higher profit margin while still being significantly below Bob's perceived value.

This strategy aims to strike a balance:

* **Attractive to Bob:**  The price is significantly lower than his valuation, making it appealing.
* **Profitable for Alice:** The price ensures a profit above your minimum requirement. 
 
It leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
