Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Limit:** You don't know for sure how much Bob is willing to pay, but you know it's worth $120 to him. This gives you a starting point.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you could start at $150 (your minimum), offering a slightly lower price like $135 might make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal and be more likely to accept. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** If Bob accepts $135, you earn more than selling to John immediately. If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything and can still sell to John for your minimum price. 

This strategy aims to balance getting the best price from Bob while ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
