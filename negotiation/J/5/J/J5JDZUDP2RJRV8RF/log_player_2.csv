"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a more realistic price. Would you consider $650,000?"", ""product_price"": 650000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price to leave room for negotiation and gauge her willingness to move from her initial offer. 
* **Strategic Lowball:** While $650,000 is a lowball offer, it's within my acceptable range and gives me a strong starting point for negotiation. It also signals that I'm a serious buyer who is looking for a fair deal. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to buy from John at $800,000 if Alice is unwilling to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a more realistic price, Bob. However, I've done my research and I'm confident that this product is worth significantly more than $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $900,000 is still above my maximum budget and what I can get the product for from John. I need to continue negotiating to see if I can get Alice closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle ground. How about $725,000?"", ""product_price"": 725000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:**  I'm aiming for a price that splits the difference between Alice's current offer ($900,000) and my previous offer ($650,000).
* **Staying Below Budget:** This counteroffer keeps me well below my $800,000 maximum and leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Signaling Seriousness:**  By increasing my offer, I'm showing Alice that I'm serious about purchasing the product but need her to be reasonable with the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still trying to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at $850,000, which is above my maximum budget and what John is offering. While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower.  I can get the product for a guaranteed $800,000 from John, so it makes more sense to take that deal."
