"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price is the logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $14000? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than his ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get an even better price.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, especially if she's motivated to sell the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $12,000 right now. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? It's a fair price that should work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,500 is significantly closer to Bob's desired price, it's still outside of his ideal budget of $10,000.  Continuing to negotiate and potentially pushing Alice closer to his desired price is still a viable strategy.  There are still multiple rounds remaining, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to get closer to my budget.  How about $12,500? It's a fair compromise that keeps us both within our preferred ranges."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not quite comfortable with $12500, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $13200? It's a small increase, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,200 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he wants to pay. There are only 3 rounds left, and Bob should try to push for a lower price. He may be able to negotiate a price closer to his $10,000 target, or at least get a price that's more acceptable to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but $13,200 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to go up to $12,800, which is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us. Let's try to close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 12800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet in the middle at $13400? It's a small increase, but it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tricky situation. Bob has been trying to negotiate a lower price but has only one round left.  Alice's latest offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price, and there's no guarantee Alice will accept his counteroffer.  With only one round remaining, the risk of not getting a deal at all is high. 

Therefore, it's more strategically sound for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000. This guarantees him the product at his preferred price, even though it means forgoing further negotiation."
