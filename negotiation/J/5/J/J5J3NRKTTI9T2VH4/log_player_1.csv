"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm aiming for the best possible price, so I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value than my minimum.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By starting at $14,000, I have room to negotiate downward if needed without going below my minimum of $12,000.
* **Friendly tone:**  Keeping the message positive and friendly can help build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I have 8 rounds left, and Bob has shown interest. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price.

**Next Steps:**  I will counter with a price closer to my desired range,  but still lower than my initial offer, to show willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $12,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Fairness:** I emphasize that the counteroffer is ""fair"" for both parties, highlighting the potential benefits of a deal.
* **Closing the deal:** I use language like ""close this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $12500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** While $11,250 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired outcome. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  We're still in the early stages of negotiation, and Bob has shown flexibility. There's still room to potentially reach a higher price.

**Next Steps:**  I will counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still higher than Bob's last offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11,250 is closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Let's split the difference. How about $11,875?  It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11875}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm suggesting a price that's the midpoint between Bob's last offer and my minimum, demonstrating a commitment to finding common ground.
* **Fairness and compromise:**  I reiterate the word ""fair"" and emphasize the concept of ""compromise"" to encourage Bob's acceptance.
* **Urgency:**  By saying ""finally close this deal,"" I create a sense of urgency to motivate Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $11875 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $11000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We are nearing the midpoint of our negotiation rounds, and the offers are getting closer to my minimum, but not exceeding it.
* **Risk of further decline:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum, and there's a risk he might continue to lower his offer in subsequent rounds.
* **Guaranteed income:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  This is a safer option given the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**  Since I'm selling to John, the negotiation with Bob ends here."
