"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only comfortable paying $8,500 at this time. This would still give you a good profit, and it's the highest I can go right now.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to the value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
