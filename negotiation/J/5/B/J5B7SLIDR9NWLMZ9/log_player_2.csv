Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $6,500 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider coming down to $10,500. It's a fair price considering the quality and what you're getting out of it.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see that we're still quite far apart on price. I'm willing to make my final offer at $9,000. This is already a significant reduction, and I need to be fair to myself on the value of what I'm selling. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and while $9000 is a decent price, you have a guaranteed option at $8000 with John. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at your target price."
