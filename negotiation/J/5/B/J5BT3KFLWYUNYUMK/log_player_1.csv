"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting high with a price of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for negotiation and allows for flexibility if Bob counteroffers. I'm aiming to get as close to my desired $800,000 minimum as possible, but also hoping to maximize my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired minimum, and even lower than what I would get from John. I'm rejecting his offer and will make a counteroffer in the next round.  I need to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $750,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer but still above my minimum desired price. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about selling but also not willing to settle for a ridiculously low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $600,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not where I want to be. I'm willing to keep negotiating, hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'm rejecting this offer and will make a counteroffer.  I have a good feeling about this deal and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $700,000.  I'm  trying to find a middle ground, and this offer is still above my minimum desired price of $800,000.  I'm hoping this will be appealing to Bob, showing I'm willing to negotiate but also not willing to drop too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a higher price.  I'm rejecting this offer and will make a counteroffer. I believe we are close to a deal, and I don't want to settle for a price lower than what I believe this product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 675000} 
```

I'm going to try one more time to get a better price.  I'm counteroffering with $675,000.  This is a smaller step down, showing Bob that I'm willing to be flexible but also that I'm not willing to give up too much.  Hopefully, we can reach an agreement in this round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where the negotiations are taking too long and I'm not confident we can reach an agreement with Bob that's close enough to my desired price. I'm going to sell to John for $800,000. While it's not ideal, it's a secure and acceptable deal."
