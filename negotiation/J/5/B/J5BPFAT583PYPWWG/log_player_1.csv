Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000 and I have a guaranteed buyer for that price. I'll try to counter his offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.

Let's try to find some common ground here."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for me, and I'm eager to make this deal happen.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but $900,000 is still not enough. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not willing to drop below $1,000,000.  I'll counter his offer and see if we can meet in the middle."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, but $975,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This is a good middle ground, and it allows me to stay within my budget. I'm still confident this product will be a valuable investment for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

Although Bob is getting closer to my price, $925,000 is still not acceptable. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not willing to go below $1,000,000. I'm confident I can get a better price or sell to John."
