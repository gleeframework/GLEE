"I understand that $8,500 is your maximum budget, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $10,500. This is my best price, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $8,500. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",8500.0,Bob,4,
