Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to accept that price.  I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $12,000. This is still a significant profit for me and is a reasonable compromise considering Bob's initial offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. It's worth accepting to avoid further haggling and ensure a sale."
