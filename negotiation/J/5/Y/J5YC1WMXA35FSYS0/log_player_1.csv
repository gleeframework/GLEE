"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but it still allows room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be interested, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is a good deal. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it's likely that I won't get a better offer in the remaining rounds.  It's more beneficial to accept his offer and secure the sale rather than risk losing a deal and ending up with only $80 from John."
