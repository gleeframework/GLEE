"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree the product is valuable, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This price reflects the true value of the product and ensures both of us benefit from this transaction.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
