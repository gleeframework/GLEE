Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go over $8,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I'm not comfortable dropping to $8,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $9,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $9,250? It's a small step closer to my initial offer and a good compromise for both of us. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $8,900 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $9,100. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.
