,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go over $8,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm not comfortable dropping to $8,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $9,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference -  how about $8,750?  This shows I'm serious about buying, and it's a fair price for the product.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $9,250? It's a small step closer to my initial offer and a good compromise for both of us. Let me know if that works for you.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still committed to buying your product, but $9,250 is still above my budget.  Let's meet in the middle once more - how about $8,900? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $8,900 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $9,100. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. ",9100.0,Alice,7,
