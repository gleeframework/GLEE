"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $9,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that's fair for both of them. He's offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than Alice's valuation of the product. This should open up room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is cutting it too close. Let's meet halfway, how about $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is reasonable:** $10,250 is significantly lower than Bob's initial budget of $12,000, and it's closer to Bob's counteroffer of $9,500. 
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  While Bob could counteroffer again, there's a risk that Alice will become unwilling to negotiate further, especially after already compromising.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If Bob keeps rejecting offers, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer at $10,250 is the most sensible choice. It saves Bob a significant amount of money while securing the product."
