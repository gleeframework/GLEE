Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $95 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $112.50 for the product. This is a good compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. How about we settle at $100 even? It's a fair price and it works for my budget."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, but $100 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is a good compromise. This would allow me to make a decent profit, while still being a fair price for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $100. Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a better deal, and it's better to secure the product at the known $100 price from John."
