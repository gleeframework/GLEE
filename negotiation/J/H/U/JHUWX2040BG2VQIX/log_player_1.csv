"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming for the highest possible price, exceeding both our minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique potential,"" subtly justifying the high price without revealing specific details. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:** By stating our willingness to discuss, we encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process rather than immediately rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Bob's Value:** Bob's counteroffer of $1,800,000 is significantly above his stated value of $1,000,000, indicating room for further negotiation.
* **Too Early to Sell to John:** Accepting John's offer of $1,500,000 would be settling for our minimum when we have a potential buyer willing to pay more. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, we can make a counteroffer that gradually decreases the price while still staying above our minimum acceptable price. This keeps Bob engaged and potentially leads to a higher final sale price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, the product's unique features and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, reflecting the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Price Reduction:** We've reduced our price by $200,000, showing flexibility but maintaining a firm stance above both Bob's offer and our minimum.
* **Value Reiteration:** The message subtly reiterates the product's value and potential, justifying the higher price without explicitly revealing details.
* **Compromise Language:** By framing the counteroffer as a ""fair compromise,"" we aim to encourage Bob to reciprocate with a more agreeable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the product's unique features and potential, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $2,000,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is still $100,000 more than John's guaranteed offer. It's worth continuing negotiations for a potentially better outcome.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob is consistently moving closer to our desired price range. Rejecting this offer maintains the momentum of the negotiation and encourages him to increase his offer further.
* **Time Consideration:** We are in Round 4 of 10. We have time for at least a few more rounds to try and secure a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to accept $1,850,000 for the product.  This offer reflects my best attempt to reach an agreement that benefits us both."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're reducing our price by $150,000, a significant drop that demonstrates our willingness to make a deal.
* **Midpoint Price:** This counteroffer sits strategically between Bob's last offer ($1,600,000) and our previous price ($2,000,000), suggesting a fair compromise.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating that this offer reflects our ""best attempt,"" we subtly introduce a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to accept before we reconsider. 
* **Above John's Offer:**  Importantly, this price still keeps us comfortably above John's standing offer of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,700,000 is a significant profit above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob has consistently increased his offers, but in smaller increments.  This suggests we might be approaching his upper limit.
* **Time Value:**  We've engaged in good faith negotiations. Accepting now secures the deal and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or us having to settle for John's price later. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we could push for more, there's a risk Bob walks away. Accepting a strong offer now outweighs the potential of losing the deal for a marginally better price later."
