While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still a bit too high. I'm confident that I can negotiate further and secure a better price.  It's risky to accept her offer at this point, as I might be able to get it for closer to my maximum budget."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my preferred price.  Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but it's risky.  It's likely that if I continue, the price will not drop below my budget. It is more advantageous to buy from John at this point."
