"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, you can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  There's a gap between your value and Alice's value ($12,000 vs $10,000), so there's room for a deal that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a good starting point for the negotiation. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial price of $11,000, demonstrating your serious interest in buying the product while still leaving some room for compromise.  It also offers Alice a profit above her $10,000 value, making it likely she will consider your offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,800, which is significantly closer to your ideal price. While you might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible or you'll run out of rounds before reaching a better deal.  Accepting this offer is the most sensible decision in this scenario, as you save $1,200 compared to buying from John."
