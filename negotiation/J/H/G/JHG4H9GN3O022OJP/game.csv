"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but the gap is still a bit wide for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I believe that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $700,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to see a more substantial increase. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for the value this product brings.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you said that was your final offer, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground here.  I can go up to $750,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I need to be mindful of my budget.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $750,000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see a bit more movement from you. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is my last offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
