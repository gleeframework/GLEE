Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $750,000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking to a price point significantly above your maximum. She's made two ""final"" offers and seems unlikely to budge. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product from John at your target price."
