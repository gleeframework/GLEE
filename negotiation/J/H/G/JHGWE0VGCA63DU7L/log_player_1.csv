Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By starting at $200, we maximize our potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** $200 is a significant mark-up from our minimum value of $150, leaving room for negotiation and potential compromise.
* **Positive and Engaging Message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, we'll adjust our strategy:

* **If Bob Accepts:** Great! We've achieved a good price.
* **If Bob Rejects:** We'll analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's worth continuing the negotiation. We'll also consider our fallback option of selling to John for $150 if Bob's offer is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  $120 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **We have a better fallback option.** Selling to John for $150 guarantees a higher profit than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Opportunity to negotiate:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows us to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. 

**Next Steps:**

We will counteroffer Bob with a price that is still higher than our minimum but lower than our initial offer. This will show flexibility while still aiming for a good price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $175 to make this work.  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** We've lowered our price from $200 to $175, demonstrating flexibility while still remaining above our minimum price.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** We acknowledge Bob's interest and use a friendly tone to encourage continued negotiation.
* **Highlight the value:** We reiterate that $175 is still a good deal for Bob, emphasizing the value of the product. 

**Next Steps:**

We'll wait for Bob's response and adjust our strategy based on his reaction:

* **If Bob accepts:** We've secured a price that's higher than our minimum and leaves us with a good profit.
* **If Bob rejects:** We'll evaluate his counteroffer, consider our options (including selling to John), and decide whether to continue negotiating or walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $175, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is our minimum.** While we could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that we can get a higher price from Bob.
* **Time is a factor.** Continuing to negotiate could prolong the process and potentially delay our profit.
* **John offers a guaranteed sale.**  Selling to John for $150 ensures an immediate sale and avoids any further negotiation risk. 

**Conclusion:**

Although we could continue to negotiate with Bob, the certainty of a $150 sale from John makes selling to him the most advantageous option."
