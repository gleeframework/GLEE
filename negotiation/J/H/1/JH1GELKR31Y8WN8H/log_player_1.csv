Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $115 is more than your minimum of $100. 
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $115 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($120), giving him incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can still increase the price if Bob makes a low counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and am willing to pay up to $100 for it. Could we possibly work towards a mutual agreement? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's still worth trying to get a better price.  You can likely squeeze a bit more out of him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, how about $105?  That leaves us both with some wiggle room. "", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $105 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to meet at that price point. Would it be possible to consider $100 as a final offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has made it clear he's not willing to go higher than $100.  Since John is offering the same price, there's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob. Selling to John guarantees you the minimum you're willing to accept, and saves you time and effort."
