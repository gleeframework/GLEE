"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will be a great asset to your business.  I understand its value to you and am willing to negotiate a fair price. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This gives you a significant savings while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. Let's discuss this further and find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly less than buying from John. Accepting this offer makes the most financial sense."
