"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1500000, but I'm willing to make a concession to get the ball rolling. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Considering the value of the product for me is $1500000, I'm willing to pay $1000000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to you. Considering your offer of $1000000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with a price of $1100000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you place on the product and the value I place on it. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
