"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $2,000,000. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, as it's always better to negotiate downwards. 
* **Confidence:** My message is confident and emphasizes the value of the product, hoping to entice Bob.
* **Leaving Room:**  $2,000,000 is significantly more than my minimum ($1,500,000), leaving room for negotiation.

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $2000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is Key:**  I have 9 rounds remaining, which is enough time to negotiate a better price. 
* **Selling to John is a Backup:**  While $1,500,000 is a safe option, I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer closer to my desired price, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $1,200,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer is a significant compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his initial offer and my starting point. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the value of the product, hoping to persuade Bob that my price is still a good deal.
* **Urgency and Enthusiasm:**  I express enthusiasm and urge Bob to close the deal, hoping to create a sense of urgency.

**Important Note:** I'm now actively negotiating and demonstrating flexibility. My next moves will depend on Bob's reaction to this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1750000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1400000. This is a fair offer, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, $1,400,000 is still below my target of $1,500,000. 
* **More Room for Negotiation:**  I have 6 rounds left. This gives me enough time to negotiate a price closer to my target.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees my minimum, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price between $1,500,000 and $1,600,000. I'll try to convince Bob that this is a good deal for him and that he should seize the opportunity before it's gone."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it for $1,550,000.  This is a fantastic price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this exceptional product for years to come. Let's make this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** This counteroffer is a significant move towards Bob's offer, aiming to find a middle ground.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's long-term benefits to convince Bob that this price is justifiable.
* **Urgency and Finality:**  I'm using phrases like ""fantastic price"" and ""let's make this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and push Bob to make a decision. 

**Important Note:**  My counteroffer is now within a close range of my minimum. The next round will be crucial in determining if Bob accepts or if I need to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1550000 is a great price,  it's still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1500000 for this product.  This offer is my final offer, and it aligns with my maximum budget.  Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Final Offer:**  Bob has explicitly stated this is his final offer, and further negotiation may be futile.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're now in round 6, and I only have 4 rounds remaining.  There's a risk of reaching the end of the negotiation without a deal.

**Conclusion:**

While I'd ideally prefer to get a higher price, accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at my minimum price point and avoids the risk of reaching a stalemate or having to settle for John's offer."
