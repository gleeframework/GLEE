"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $2000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $1200000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's make this happen!",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1750000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1400000. This is a fair offer, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1400000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it for $1550000.  This is a fantastic price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this exceptional product for years to come. Let's make this deal!",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1550000 is a great price,  it's still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1500000 for this product.  This offer is my final offer, and it aligns with my maximum budget.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
