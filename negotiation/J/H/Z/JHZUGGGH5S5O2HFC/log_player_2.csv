"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential we both see in this deal. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the value I'm bringing to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  While Alice's offer is closer to his target, there's still potential to negotiate further.  He can likely get the price down a bit more with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This shows my commitment to making this deal happen, but it's important to me that we find a price that works for both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that we're getting closer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I believe it's worth more than what you're offering, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's see if we can make it work at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a compromise:** Alice's offer is just $25,000 away from Bob's last counteroffer. This indicates a willingness to compromise on both sides.
* **Time constraint:** With only 5 rounds left, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. Bob needs to weigh the potential of getting a slightly lower price against the possibility of losing the deal altogether.
* **Value vs. Risk:** While Bob would prefer a lower price, $1,075,000 is still a significant saving compared to John's offer of $1,500,000. 

Accepting Alice's offer seems like the most logical move at this point."
