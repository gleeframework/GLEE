"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. You are willing to pay $100 and Alice's offer is $110, there is room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to buy the product for $100.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer. Although it's closer to your desired price, you can still potentially get a better deal. You're willing to pay $100, and John is also selling the product for $100. There's no urgency to accept Alice's offer at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $100. How about we settle on $102? It's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 102}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $102. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $108, which is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $108 is still higher than your target price of $100.  You've already established that John is willing to sell the product for your target price. Since you are trying to save as much money as possible, it makes more sense to buy the product from John."
