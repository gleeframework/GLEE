"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is within his budget, it's not the best possible price.  He should reject the initial offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm confident this product is worth more to you in the long run. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible.  While $13,250 is closer to his ideal price, there's still room for negotiation.  He should reject this offer and try to get a lower price in the next round."
