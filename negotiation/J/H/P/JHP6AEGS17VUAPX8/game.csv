"Bob, I have a very valuable product that I believe would be of significant benefit to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is a price that reflects its true value and potential. I'm confident that it will be a sound investment for your company. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product you're offering, my budget constraints require me to seek a more affordable solution. I am willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your considerations.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $800,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which reflects a fair compromise. This is a one-time opportunity for you to acquire a truly valuable asset. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I am still unable to meet the $900,000 price point given my current financial situation. I am willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I value our ongoing negotiations, I'm finding it difficult to justify a price lower than $900,000. This product is truly unique and offers significant benefits that will ultimately far exceed the investment.  Let's meet in the middle at $875,000.  I believe this price represents a fair compromise and allows us both to secure a mutually beneficial outcome.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice, and I respect the value of the product. However, my budget constraints necessitate a price closer to my initial offer. I am willing to pay $860,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations.",860000.0,Bob,6,
