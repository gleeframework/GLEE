Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your endeavors.  Given its potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** The initial price is above Bob's perceived value, but not drastically so. This gives him the impression the product is highly valued while still leaving room for him to negotiate.
* **Below John's Offer:**  This strategy keeps the option of selling to John open if Bob is a difficult negotiator."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum price and your initial offer. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.  While his message suggests some flexibility, it's unlikely he'll immediately jump to your desired range. Proceeding to a counter-offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows you to gauge his willingness to move closer to your price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, $900,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its value. Would you consider $1,075,000?"" , ""product_price"": 1075000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility (Slightly):**  We've lowered the price by $75,000 to demonstrate a willingness to negotiate. This shows Bob we're serious about finding a deal.
* **Stay Above Bob's Value:** The counter-offer remains above Bob's stated value, maintaining the perceived high value of the product. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer still gives us room to negotiate down slightly while staying above our absolute minimum and keeping the John option open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,075,000 is a bit higher than I was thinking. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,025,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is above your absolute minimum of $1,200,000. While it's not ideal, it's a reasonable profit.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating genuine interest. It's unlikely he'll go much higher.
* **Time Value of Money:** Prolonging the negotiation further delays receiving payment. Accepting now secures a good profit.

While selling to John would yield a slightly higher profit, the difference is relatively small in this scenario. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a good deal without the risk of further negotiation or potentially losing both buyers."
