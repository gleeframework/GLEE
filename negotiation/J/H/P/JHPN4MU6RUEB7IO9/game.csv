"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I come down to $155? Let me know what you think.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $155 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $137.50?",137.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $137.50 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we settle on $145? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $140, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'd be happy to make a deal.",140.0,Bob,6,
