"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $950000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1050000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of a price of $1030000.

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $990000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum acceptable price. I'm thinking of a price of $1020000.

"Bob, I understand you're making a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $985000. I've made several concessions already, and I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time, but I need to be at $1015000. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1015000.0,Alice,9,
