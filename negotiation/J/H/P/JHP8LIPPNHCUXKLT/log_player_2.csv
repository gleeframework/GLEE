"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. I am proposing a price of $12,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's closer to her valuation than mine. I should counter with a much lower offer to see how much she's willing to negotiate.  There's plenty of room to work towards a better price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 5000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I understand your position, and I would like to propose a compromise. I am willing to consider a price of $7,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,000 is much closer to a reasonable price, it's still above my maximum.  I'm willing to counter slightly above John's price to see if I can get a better deal than $8,000, but I won't hesitate to go with John if Alice doesn't budge much further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for working with me. That's closer, but still a bit high for my budget. How about $6,000? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
