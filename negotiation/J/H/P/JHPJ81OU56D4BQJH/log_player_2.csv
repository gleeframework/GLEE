"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  It's still a good deal for both of us, and closer to my initial offer. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer but still above your desired price.  You can save $200,000 compared to buying from John, which is a significant saving."
