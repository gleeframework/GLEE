Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment.  I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential upside for you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing a great deal for Alice.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's unique value to Bob specifically, making it more likely he'll be willing to pay a premium.
* **Backup Plan:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a safety net. This allows for a bolder opening offer to Bob."
