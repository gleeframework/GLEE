"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is far too high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I can't afford your asking price. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can make this work.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep, but I still think the product is worth more than $8,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm really hoping to get this product, but I need a price that's closer to my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000.  It's a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering we are both trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. ",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering it to you for $16,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $16,000 is still above what I'm comfortable spending. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm offering $12,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not be able to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm willing to keep negotiating. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping it's more in line with what you're looking for.",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concern about reaching a middle ground, but I'm still hoping we can find a solution.  $14,000 is closer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm offering $13,000.  It's a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can finally make this work.",13000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $14,000, Bob. I'm making one final offer. If you're really interested in this product, I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. This is my last concession, and I expect you to take it seriously.",13500.0,Alice,9,
