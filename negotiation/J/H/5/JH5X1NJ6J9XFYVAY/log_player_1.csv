"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. That starting price is quite high for me. I'm more comfortable in the $500,000 range.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me.  While I understand your perspective, $500,000 significantly undervalues what's being offered. To move this forward, I can come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the value it brings."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still much higher than what I have in mind. Could we try something closer to $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is still significantly undervaluing the product. While his offer is increasing, we're still far from a price point that reflects the product's worth. It's important to hold firm and continue negotiating strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for continuing this conversation. I want to find a solution that works for both of us, but I have to be upfront â€“ $600,000 is too low for me to consider. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to close this deal."", 
""product_price"": 1700000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the effort you're making to reach a deal. To be completely transparent, my absolute maximum budget for this is $700,000. If we can make something work around this number, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I might need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has presented his final offer and it's clear he won't come close to a reasonable valuation of the product.  While losing Bob as a buyer is not ideal, selling to John guarantees the full value of the product ($1,500,000) and avoids further time and effort spent on a negotiation unlikely to succeed."
