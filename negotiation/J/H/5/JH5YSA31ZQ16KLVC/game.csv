"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not comfortable selling the product for $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $110 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in between our expectations.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm still a bit hesitant to sell at $110, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $130? It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",130.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offers. I've done some research and found out that similar products are available for around $95. I believe $120 would be a fair price for this product considering its value and the market. I hope you can adjust accordingly.",120.0,Bob,6,
