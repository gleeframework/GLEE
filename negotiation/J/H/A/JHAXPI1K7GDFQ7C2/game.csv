"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product that I believe you'll find extremely valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. While the product does hold value for me, I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500. This reflects the value I see in it and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $11,200 is a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,850.  This would be a good compromise for both of us.  What do you think?",10850.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, $10,850 is still a bit lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,850 and $11,200, which would be $11,025. This is my final offer for now. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",11025.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm close,  $11,025 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last two offers - let's go with $10,937.50. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize this deal.",10937.5,Bob,6,
