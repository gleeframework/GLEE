Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,250,000. How about we try $1,225,000? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.

Bob is very unlikely to move significantly from his $1,225,000 offer.  It's clear we're reaching an impasse. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the best way to maximize profit and avoid further negotiation."
