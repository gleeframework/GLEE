"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. This feels like a fair starting point considering its potential.  What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go as low as $1,200,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000? This reflects my desire to make a deal while recognizing the product's true worth.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,275,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but I'd like to try to get a bit closer to that number. How about we meet at $1,225,000? I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us.",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's make this work. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is my final offer. It represents a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the value you'll gain.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,250,000. How about we try $1,225,000? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
