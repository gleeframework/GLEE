"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $900,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  You have 10 rounds, so there's room to bargain.
* **Buying from John is a backup:**  You can always go to John if negotiations fail, but it's better to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant counteroffer:** This shows Alice that you're serious about negotiating.
* **Stay within your budget:** $850,000 is still under your maximum limit. 
* **Leave room for further negotiation:**  A $50,000 gap gives Alice some room to negotiate while still getting a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $875,000 is under your maximum limit of $1,000,000.
* **It's a good price:**  You've successfully negotiated a lower price from the initial $900,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While you could try for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject further offers, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it."
