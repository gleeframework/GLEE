It's always worth exploring negotiation before committing.  $650,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 550000}

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This will give me some negotiating room, while still showing I'm serious about buying."

While $600,000 is better than $650,000, I'm still hoping to get a lower price. I'll counteroffer again."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 575000}

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still want a good deal.  $575,000 is a fair compromise that could potentially be accepted."

Alice is not budging much.  I'll counteroffer again, but I'm getting closer to my limit."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

I'm raising my offer again to show I'm serious but also pushing for a price closer to my ideal.  $600,000 is a reasonable compromise, and if Alice rejects, I'll be more likely to consider John's offer."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still being stubborn, but $637,500 is getting closer to my limit. I'll counteroffer one more time before seriously considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 625000}
```

I'm offering a price closer to Alice's last offer, but still trying to squeeze out a slightly better deal. If this fails, I'm prepared to go with John's offer."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We're getting very close to my limit with Alice. While I'm tempted to keep negotiating, there's only one round left and I'm not sure I can get a significantly lower price from Alice.  It's time to secure the product and go with John's offer."
