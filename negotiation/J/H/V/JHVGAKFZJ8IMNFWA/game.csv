"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $175. This is a great compromise, considering the value of the product to you is $150. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway Alice, but $175 is still a little steep for me. How about $125?",125.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to compromise further and sell it to you for $150. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value of the product to me is $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,5,
