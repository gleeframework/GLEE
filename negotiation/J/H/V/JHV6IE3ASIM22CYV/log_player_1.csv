{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a unique piece and I believe it holds great value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price above your minimum, aiming to potentially get a higher price from Bob. It also emphasizes the product's uniqueness to pique his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $15,000 is your minimum, Bob's offer is at the absolute bottom of your acceptable range. I'm going to try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, I'm not quite ready to go down to $15,000. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500? This would still be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not comfortable with $17500. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can we meet somewhere in between? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of going back and forth with Bob is too high.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John and avoid any potential further losses."
