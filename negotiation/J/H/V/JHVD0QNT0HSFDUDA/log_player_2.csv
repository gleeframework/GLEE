Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  I can go as low as $130, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $130, and it makes more sense to buy from John for $120 and save the extra money."
