"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $80. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference at $115? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, which is a fair compromise. Let's make this deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I hope you'll agree.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $98. This is my final offer, let's close this deal.",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $98 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $101.50. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen.",101.5,Alice,7,
