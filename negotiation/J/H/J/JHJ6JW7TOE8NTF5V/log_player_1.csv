{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to make this a worthwhile transaction. I propose a price of $925,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I offer it elsewhere."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible. Offering a price slightly below his maximum valuation increases your chances of acceptance while leaving a significant profit margin.

**The Offer:**

* $925,000 is high enough to give you a substantial profit above your minimum.
* It leaves Bob with a potential ""deal"" feeling, as he's saving $75,000 from his perceived value.
* The message emphasizes exclusivity and time sensitivity, subtly encouraging a quicker decision."
