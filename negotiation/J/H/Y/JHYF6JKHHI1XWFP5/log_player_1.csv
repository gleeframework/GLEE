"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves some space for negotiation, showing Bob I'm open to discussion while still aiming high.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the product's value and emphasizes a collaborative approach to the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and his perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss compared to selling to John.  I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm comfortable with.  To find a middle ground, I propose $875,000.  This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):**  I'm moving closer to the middle ground between my initial offer ($950,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($700,000). However, I'm weighting it more towards my initial price as it's closer to his perceived value.
* **Justified Stance:** I'm reiterating the product's value and my reason for not accepting his low offer while still showing flexibility. 
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  The message aims for a collaborative tone, emphasizing finding a solution that works for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $875,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $785,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $785,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $785,000 is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I could potentially negotiate for a bit more, the difference is relatively small, and accepting ensures I close the deal.  There's always the risk that Bob might lower his offer or that negotiations could stall, making selling to John the safer and more profitable option at this point."
