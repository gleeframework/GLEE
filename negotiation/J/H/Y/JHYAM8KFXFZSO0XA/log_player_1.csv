"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so this offer leaves $50,000 on the table for him. This leaves room for potential concessions during negotiation and helps to avoid early rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm under pressure to make a deal, $900,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can secure a price closer to my desired range. Selling to John at $1,000,000 is an option, but I want to see if I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility and encourage Bob to continue the negotiation.  $1,050,000 is still a good price for me, and it leaves room for further compromise in the next few rounds.  This offer demonstrates my willingness to meet him halfway while still securing a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied.  I believe there's more room for negotiation, and selling to John for $1,000,000 seems like the safer option right now. However, I'm going to take one more round to see if I can push Bob a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1020000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's latest offer but still gives me a profit. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise, but I'm also showing Bob that I won't accept a price significantly lower than my desired range.  This approach keeps the negotiation moving and might lead Bob to offer a price closer to my target in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,010,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,010,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,010,000 is slightly above my minimum acceptable price and is a significant improvement from his previous offers. While I could continue negotiating and try to push for a higher price, there's no guarantee that I'll be successful. Accepting this offer ensures I'm getting a decent profit and avoids the risk of the negotiation falling apart or being forced to sell to John for a lower price."
