Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,999. I think it would be a valuable addition and I'm offering it to you at this price before I list it publicly."", ""product_price"": 11999}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have a safety net. Aiming higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) is key to maximizing your potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high ($11,999) allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting closer to your minimum acceptable price ($10,000). 
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning a public listing implies that the product might not be available for long and could attract other buyers, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** While this strategy aims to maximize profit, there's always a chance Bob will reject the offer. However, having John as a backup ensures you won't sell for less than your minimum."
