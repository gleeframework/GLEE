"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to get your hands on this incredible item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be happy to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering your offer of $9,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at that price. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is your maximum, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, considering the product's value to you, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise again and offer you a price of $10,200. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",10200.0,Alice,5,
