"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1200000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go at this stage. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1100000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1050000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1080000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1080000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to offer $1060000. It's a fair price, and I believe we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
