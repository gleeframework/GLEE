"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal compared to the product's true worth, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $8,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Bob can potentially get the product for cheaper by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get closer to his desired price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer, $9,000 is still below what I need for the product. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and we could finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $9,500 is still above his budget of $8,000.  At this point, it's better for Bob to secure the product from John at his maximum price of $8,000 rather than risk further negotiation and potentially end up paying more."
