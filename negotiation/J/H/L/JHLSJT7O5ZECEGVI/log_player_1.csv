Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:**  $12,000 is still above Bob's $8,000 valuation, giving him incentive to negotiate. 
* **Lower than your minimum:** It's below your minimum of $15,000, but leaves room for negotiation and potential profit.

I've also added a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum of $15,000 and significantly lower than my initial offer. I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $8,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept it.  There's a chance Bob might be willing to go a bit higher, and I want to explore that possibility. I'll counteroffer with a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer, $9,000 is still below what I need for the product. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and we could finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
