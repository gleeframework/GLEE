"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but I'm not sure I can go that high. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. It's clear you recognize the value of this product.  While $1,500,000 is my ideal price, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $1,250,000?  It's a fair compromise that's closer to our meeting point.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
