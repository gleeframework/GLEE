"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the competitive pricing. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,750. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better price elsewhere.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $8,750 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,600. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",8600.0,Bob,4,
