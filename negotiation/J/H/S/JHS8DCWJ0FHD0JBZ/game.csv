"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $20,000 price point. Would you consider accepting $12,000 for the product?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
