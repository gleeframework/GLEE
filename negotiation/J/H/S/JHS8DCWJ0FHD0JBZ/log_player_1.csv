Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I believe it holds significant value and I'm happy to discuss a price that works well for both of us. How about we start at $20,000?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $20,000 price point. Would you consider accepting $12,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I must respectfully decline the $16,000 offer. Given my financial situation, I can't go beyond $14,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Bob's offer is only $1,000 less than John's guaranteed offer. It makes more sense to accept the slightly lower price from Bob to avoid potentially dragging out the negotiation further and risking no deal at all.
