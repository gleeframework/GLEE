Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500.  I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Beat Bob's Value:**  The offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000), but it's unlikely Bob would accept an offer close to $12,000.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice is secure knowing John will buy it for her minimum acceptable price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
