"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to get it for a bit less. How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get it for a bit less, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92? I think that's a fair compromise.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $92 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $88? It's closer to my budget and still a good deal for you.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $88. How about we meet in the middle again, but this time at $91? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",91.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $91 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's try $89.  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",89.0,Bob,6,
