Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price of $12,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,000 leaves a potential $1,000 buffer if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Strong but Fair:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob while positioning the price as fair, increasing the chance of acceptance.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or willingness to pay. In a real-world scenario, gathering more information about the buyer could lead to an even better offer."
