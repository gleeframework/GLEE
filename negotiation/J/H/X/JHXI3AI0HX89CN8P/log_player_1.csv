Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $120 to you, and while I'm hesitant to let it go for less than its value to me, I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing he values it at $120.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you closer to his perceived value.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While you could start higher, asking for the full $120 might make Bob feel like you're not willing to negotiate, potentially leading to a rejection.
* **Secure a Profit Above John's Offer:** The $100 offer ensures you earn $20 more than selling to your backup buyer, John. 

This offer balances maximizing your profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
