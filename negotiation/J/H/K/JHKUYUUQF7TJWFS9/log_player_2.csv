"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above his $1,000,000 limit.  He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so it's worthwhile to try and negotiate a better deal with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to stay under $1,000,000. Would you consider $950,000? I believe this is a fair price considering the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,025,000 is closer to Bob's goal, it's still above his $1,000,000 limit. He's already had one counteroffer rejected, and further negotiation might not yield a better price.  It's safer and more financially sound to buy from John at the guaranteed price of $1,000,000."
