"I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $8,500 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $8,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a good deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",8000.0,Alice,5,
