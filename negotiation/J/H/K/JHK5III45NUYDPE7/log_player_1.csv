Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. How about we try $915,000? It's a bit of a stretch, but I'm willing to take the risk to get the deal done.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

I'm going to sell the product to John.  With only two rounds remaining, I'm worried that I won't be able to reach a price that satisfies my minimum target.  While I'd prefer to get more, John's offer is still significantly higher than my minimum requirement, and it's a sure deal."
