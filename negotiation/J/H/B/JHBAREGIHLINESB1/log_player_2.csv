"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! I'm willing to let you have it for $18000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to get a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. Since the product is worth $15,000 to Alice, I'm not sure why she's offering it to me for $18,000, which is even higher than its value to her. I'd rather buy it from John for $12,000, which is a much better deal.
