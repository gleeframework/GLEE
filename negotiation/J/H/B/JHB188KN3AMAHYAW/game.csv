"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand it's a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $110? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $108, which is still a great compromise. It's the highest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",108.0,Alice,5,
