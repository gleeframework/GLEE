"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum, aiming to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price leaves room for negotiation while still being a substantial amount.
* **Testing the waters:** This first offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential range of values."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's tempting to take $900,000, it's significantly less than my minimum value. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. 
* **Minimizing risk:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, but I'm willing to take a calculated risk to potentially get more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Mid-point compromise:** This offer is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's counteroffer, signaling my willingness to negotiate but still holding out for a significant profit.
* **Keeping it attractive:**  $1,200,000 is still considerably more than Bob's offer, potentially incentivizing him to come closer to my desired price. 
* **Avoiding deadlock:** This counteroffer avoids a potential deadlock with Bob while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Reaching a compromise:**  Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price and significantly more than what John would pay.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price or a breakdown in negotiations. Accepting Bob's offer secures a good profit and minimizes the risk of getting a lower price or missing the deal altogether. 
* **Time consideration:** With 6 rounds remaining, I have ample time to explore other opportunities if this deal falls through. However, accepting this offer allows me to secure a good profit without the uncertainty of further negotiation."
