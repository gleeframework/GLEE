Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the compromise, I still believe the product is worth less than $8500 to me. I would like to offer $8000 for it, which aligns with John's price. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your perspective, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you can meet me halfway. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
