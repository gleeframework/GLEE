Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $8,000, aiming to maximize your profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** You're giving Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to accept. 
* **It sets a clear expectation:** The message clearly communicates your offer and invites Bob to respond.

Remember, you can always adjust your price based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's worth exploring if you can get closer to your desired price. Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? "", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price. It's a good middle ground that might be more appealing to Bob than accepting his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It seems like Bob is firm on his price.  While you could continue to negotiate, it's unlikely you'll get him to go higher. Selling to John ensures you get your minimum price without further negotiation."
