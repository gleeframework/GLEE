"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $20,000. I think it's a fair price considering what you'll gain from it. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way beyond my budget. This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to consider. How about $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $5,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider coming down to $17,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, but $17,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I could go up to $7,000, but that's the absolute maximum I can do. Let me know if that works for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,000? This would be my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for working with me. I understand this is your final offer, but I need the price to be closer to my budget. Would you consider $8,000? That's the absolute most I can offer. Otherwise, I'll have to go with a different option.",8000.0,Bob,6,
