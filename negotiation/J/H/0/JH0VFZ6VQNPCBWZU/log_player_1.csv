Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that's worth a lot to me, and I think it could be valuable to you as well.  I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$20,000 starting price:** This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above your minimum threshold of $15,000. 
* **Friendly and open message:**  A positive and open tone can encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Highlighting potential value:**  Mentioning that the product could be valuable to Bob can pique his interest and make him more likely to consider your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $20000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at the moment. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than your minimum price of $15,000. Accepting his offer would result in a considerable loss for you. It's better to reject his offer and try to negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest!  While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** $12,000 is a reasonable counteroffer. It's significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than your initial asking price.
* **Maintain a friendly tone:**  Continuing to be friendly and open will keep the negotiation positive and hopefully lead to a mutually agreeable outcome.
* **Show flexibility:**  By lowering your price, you show Bob that you're willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $12000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is closer to your minimum price of $15,000, it's still not ideal. There's room for negotiation and it's worth trying to push for a price closer to your desired range.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This price is still fair for me, and hopefully, it's a good deal for you too.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  Offering $11,000, the midpoint between your previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000, shows a commitment to finding a compromise.
* **Emphasize fairness:**  Reinforcing the idea that the price is still fair for you helps Bob see the value of your offer.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  Keeping the conversation positive can help maintain a good relationship with Bob and increase the chances of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. While I'm willing to pay more than my initial offer, $11000 is still a little too high.  Would you be willing to come down to $9500? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly lower than your minimum price of $15,000. You have already negotiated several rounds and it seems Bob is unlikely to go much higher.  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees you your minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
