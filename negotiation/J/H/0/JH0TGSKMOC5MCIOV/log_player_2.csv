"Alice's offer:

You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $140? This would be a great deal for you, and still allows me to make a fair profit.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $125 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $132.50?  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly trying to come down to a reasonable price, and $132.50 is a decent compromise. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield significantly better results, and it risks losing the deal altogether."
