"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum because I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I want to see where his ""sweet spot"" is first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm offering a price that's slightly higher than Bob's counteroffer, but still lower than my initial offer. I'm hoping this will be a compromise that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, Bob's offer is now within my minimum acceptable range and we're only 4 rounds in. It's a good risk/reward scenario to accept this offer."
