I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's still significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether it's worth pursuing further. 

It's important to remember that I have a safety net with John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway by offering $13,000. This is still a decent profit for me and hopefully, it's a price Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer is getting too low. It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially getting an even lower offer.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000, which is a much better outcome."
