"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While the product sounds interesting,  $1200000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway.  $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1000000.  This is my final offer, as I have another opportunity for this product at that price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have another opportunity at $1000000, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering it to you for $1075000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
