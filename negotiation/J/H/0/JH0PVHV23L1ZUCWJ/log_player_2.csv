"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's best to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While the product sounds interesting,  $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing your serious intent to buy but also setting a firm boundary.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:**  $900,000 is still a substantial sum, leaving space for Alice to counter with a price closer to your target without feeling pressured.
* **Sets the Tone:** By starting with a strong counteroffer, you signal to Alice that you're a savvy negotiator and willing to walk away if she's unwilling to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your target price of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Since you're close to your target, a small counteroffer could potentially seal the deal without risking losing the product entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway.  $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, as I have another opportunity for this product at that price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** Stating this is your final offer creates pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the deal.
* **Alternative:**  Mentioning the other opportunity reinforces that you're not desperate and are prepared to walk away.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** This offer is a small step closer to Alice's previous offer but still within your budget. It suggests a genuine effort to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you have another opportunity at $1000000, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering it to you for $1075000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final counteroffer is still above your target price of $1,000,000.  You've reached the point where further negotiation is unlikely to lead to a lower price.  Since John offers the product at your target price, it's now more advantageous to secure the deal with John to avoid further haggling."
