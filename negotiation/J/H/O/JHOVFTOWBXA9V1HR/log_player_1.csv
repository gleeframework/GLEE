Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $100 to me, I'll try to get as close to that price as possible. Let's say I'll offer Bob the product for $90.

{""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but still higher than what the product is worth to him. Since I want to earn as much money as possible, I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. Since he was willing to pay $85, I'll increase my offer by $5 and make it $90 again. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it.
