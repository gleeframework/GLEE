Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, while still ensuring I make a profit beyond my minimum of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $90 is still above my minimum of $80, so it's worth accepting.  I can always try to get a better price in the future, but it's better to secure a sale now rather than risk losing out altogether."
