"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You value the product at $150, and Alice's offer is $140.  This is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation to get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice values the product at $120, a price of $130 is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, and hopefully, she will find it acceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $135 is a good compromise. It's only $5 more than my ideal price of $130, and much better than the $150 from John. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price without risking losing the deal or having to negotiate further."
