Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understanding that there's some negotiation involved.  $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider, though.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $16,000?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're a tough negotiator! I like that. Let's be real, though, $12,500 is cutting it very close.  I can do $13,500, but that's my absolute best.
