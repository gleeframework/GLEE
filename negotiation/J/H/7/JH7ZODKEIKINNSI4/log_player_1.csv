"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm hoping we can make a deal.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $10,000 to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is quite low, and while closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly under my minimum. I have room to negotiate but need to steer him considerably higher. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understanding that there's some negotiation involved.  $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider, though.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While $16,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider something closer to $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob is clearly trying to negotiate me down, but he's inching closer to a potentially acceptable range. $12,000 is still too low, but I need to weigh the risk of losing him as a buyer.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. I want to make this work as much as you do. How about we settle on $14,000? That's a significant compromise from my original price, reflecting my desire to get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're definitely in the ballpark now. I appreciate the concessions you've made.  How about $12,500? I think that's a very fair offer, splitting the difference between our last two figures. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a tough one. Bob is clearly feeling the pressure and wants to close the deal, but $12,500 is still a significant chunk below my minimum. I need to consider a few things:

* **Time:** I have 5 rounds left. Will Bob be willing to go higher, or am I risking losing him altogether by holding out?
* **John:** My guaranteed sale with John is looking very tempting right now.  

It's a gamble, but I think I can push Bob a little further.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, you're a tough negotiator! I like that. Let's be real, though, $12,500 is cutting it very close.  I can do $13,500, but that's my absolute best.  This is a fantastic product, and I'm confident you'll see its value, but I also need to be fair to myself.  What do you say, are we closing this deal?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're close!  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000.  That's my final offer.  It's a win-win, and we can both walk away happy. What do you say?
