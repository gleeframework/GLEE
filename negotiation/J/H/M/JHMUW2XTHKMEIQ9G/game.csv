"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a serious offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its value and allows for both of us to benefit from the deal.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,275,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
