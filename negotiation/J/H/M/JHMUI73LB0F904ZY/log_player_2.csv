"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering its true value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price, I aim to gauge her flexibility and potentially secure a much better deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial counteroffer leaves ample space for negotiation.  I expect Alice to counter, and we can hopefully meet somewhere closer to a price that works for both of us.
* **John as Backup:**  I'm keeping in mind that I can always buy the product from John for $800,000. This provides me with a strong fallback position and prevents me from feeling pressured to accept an unfavorable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is too low.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still reflects the value of the product, and it gives you a significant discount.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but she's still significantly above John's price. I'm not in a hurry and I believe I can get her closer to my target price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?"",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer suggests a price that's directly in between her previous offer and my previous counteroffer, signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Below John's Price:**  It's crucial for me to stay below $800,000 to make this deal worthwhile compared to John's offer. 
* **Testing Her Resolve:**  This offer will help me understand how flexible Alice is willing to be and if a deal within my budget is possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's closer to your offer. I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $850,000. Since I can buy the product from John for $800,000, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed savings and buy from John. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Alice for a potentially small gain."
