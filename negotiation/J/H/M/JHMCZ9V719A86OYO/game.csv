"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $12,000? That's a significant price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're agreeable.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to make my final offer at $12,500. If this works for you, I'm ready to finalize the purchase. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",12500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $13,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling the product to John for $15,000.",13000.0,Alice,7,
