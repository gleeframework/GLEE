"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $750,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $750,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $725,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $725,000 is closer, but I'm targeting something closer to $650,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",650000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $675,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",675000.0,Alice,5,
