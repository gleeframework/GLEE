"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $1,100,000?  This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth more to you than that.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
