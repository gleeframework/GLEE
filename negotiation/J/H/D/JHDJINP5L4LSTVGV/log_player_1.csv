Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $10,500 at this time. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500 to meet you halfway.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to settle for less than $11,500. I'll counteroffer again in the next round, hoping to close the deal at a price that's more favorable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250, which is a fair compromise.  This is my final offer - let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on price. However, $11,250 is still a bit more than I can realistically afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750, but that's my absolute maximum.  If you're not able to come down to that price, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000. Bob's offer of $10,750 is still too low for me, and I'm running out of rounds.  I'm confident I can get a better price from John."
