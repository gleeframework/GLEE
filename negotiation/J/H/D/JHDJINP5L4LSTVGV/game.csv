"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $10,500 at this time. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500 to meet you halfway.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250, which is a fair compromise.  This is my final offer - let's close this deal!",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on price. However, $11,250 is still a bit more than I can realistically afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750, but that's my absolute maximum.  If you're not able to come down to that price, I'll have to explore other options.",10750.0,Bob,6,
