"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm eager to make this deal work, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This would still give you a significant return on your investment, and it's a fair price for the value of the product. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
