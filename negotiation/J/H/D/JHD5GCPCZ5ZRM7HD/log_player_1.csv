Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I have this great product that I think you'd really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It's important to remember that we want to maximize our profit, but also be mindful of potentially losing Bob as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, we can likely do better. We'll try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle on $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While we could potentially continue negotiating, $95 is a good price that significantly surpasses our minimum value and is likely close to the maximum we can get from Bob."
