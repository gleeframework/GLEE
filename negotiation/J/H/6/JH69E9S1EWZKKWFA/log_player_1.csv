"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to secure a better price.  There's a chance he may be willing to go higher, and I want to explore that possibility before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to go down to $9,500 for the product, but that's my absolute minimum. I think it's still a great deal for you, considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $9500 is still a bit high for me. How about $9000?  I'm really hoping to close this deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I want to see if I can push Bob a little further. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to explore that before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we split the difference at $9,250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the closest I can come right now.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
