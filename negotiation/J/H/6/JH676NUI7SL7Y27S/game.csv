"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250? This gives us both a good deal and allows me to sell the product without taking a significant loss. Let me know your thoughts.",11250.0,Alice,3,
