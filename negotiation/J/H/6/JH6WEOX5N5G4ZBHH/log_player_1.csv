{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's important to be polite and express confidence in the product's worth.  This sets the stage for a potentially successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm hoping to get. I'm going to counter with a slightly higher price to see if Bob is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. $10,500 is a bit low for me, considering the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a little to $10,750, but that's my final offer. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't find a better opportunity like this."", ""product_price"": 10750}
