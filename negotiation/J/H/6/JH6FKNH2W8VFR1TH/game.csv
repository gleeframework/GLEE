"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. This is a unique item, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth and offers you a fair deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I have a budget in mind.  Could we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $800,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, but I'm getting closer. How about we settle at $875,000? This allows us both to benefit from the deal.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a fair offer and I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  To be honest, $875,000 is a little bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to finalize the deal at $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,6,
