"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,500, which is a good starting point considering the product is worth $15,000 to Bob and $10,000 to me. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price gives us both some room to negotiate without feeling like we're giving away too much.
* **Friendly Tone:**  Keeping the message friendly and open to discussion is important in the early stages of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Profit:** While $11,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000, which means I'm losing money if I sell to Bob at that price.
* **Negotiation Power:** Since I have 10 rounds, it's worth continuing to negotiate. It's possible I can get Bob to come up closer to my ideal price.
* **Jhon is a Safety Net:** I have Jhon as a fallback option, so there's no immediate pressure to accept a deal that is below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $11,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This would still give you a good deal, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I've shown I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  A counteroffer of $11,500 is a compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer and his.  This shows flexibility and a willingness to work together.
* **Reinforcing Value:**  I remind Bob of the value of the product to him, emphasizing that this price is still a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $11,200 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob is getting closer, $11,200 is still below my minimum value of $10,000.  I'm not making any profit at that price.
* **Room for Improvement:** I've shown willingness to compromise, and Bob has shown interest in the product.  I believe we can still reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting the offer, I keep control of the negotiation and maintain leverage for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're hesitant, but $11,200 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,400. This is a very fair price, considering how much you value the product. It's a win-win for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 11400}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession by lowering my offer from $11,500 to $11,400, showing I'm trying to meet Bob halfway.
* **Emphasizing Win-Win:** I'm emphasizing that this price is still beneficial for both of us.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by stating ""Let's make this deal happen!"" to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down further, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,400. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product, and that's my final offer. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $11,000 is still below my minimum value of $10,000. Selling at this price would mean losing money.
* **Limited Rounds:** We are nearing the halfway point of the negotiation, and I want to maximize my profit.
* **Potential for Better Offer:** While Bob claims it's his final offer, I've shown willingness to compromise, and it's possible he might be willing to go slightly higher.
* **Jhon is a Backup:**  I have Jhon as a backup option, so I'm not in a rush to accept a deal that doesn't meet my minimum requirements."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still unable to go lower than $11,200.  This is a very fair price for both of us. It's clear you really want this product, and I'm willing to make a final concession. Let's make this deal happen.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm sticking to my minimum profit point, but using a firm yet friendly tone to convey my commitment.
* **Final Concessions:**  I emphasize this as my ""final concession"" to create a sense of urgency and push Bob towards acceptance.
* **Appealing to Value:**  I remind Bob of his strong interest in the product, implying that the price is still worth it. 

By this point, it's crucial to try and close the deal. I'm willing to accept $11,200, which is still a decent profit for me. If Bob rejects again, I'll be forced to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're making a final concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,200. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for the product, and that's my final offer. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are approaching the end of the negotiation, and there's a risk of running out of time.
* **No Profit:** Bob's offer of $10,800 is still below my minimum value of $10,000, meaning I'll be losing money on the sale.
* **Jhon Offers Safety:** While I'd prefer to get more from Bob, John's offer provides a guaranteed profit and avoids any further risk of losing money.  
* **Limited Potential:** It's unlikely Bob will raise his offer significantly in the remaining two rounds.

Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $10,000 to ensure a profit and avoid the risk of further negotiations failing."
