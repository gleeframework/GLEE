Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. It's a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum value of $150. I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$120 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for that, so I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm lowering my price to $175. This is still above my minimum but shows some willingness to compromise. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob, and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $140 is still below my initial target, it's above my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to take this offer, as it's better than selling to John for $150 and avoids the potential for further rounds of negotiation."
