"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $130.  It's a fantastic deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  I'll try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That product looks great, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

I'm aiming to meet roughly in the middle of our initial valuations. This leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $110 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $120? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is meeting me in the middle, and $120 is a good price. It's not worth risking a worse deal by continuing the negotiation."
