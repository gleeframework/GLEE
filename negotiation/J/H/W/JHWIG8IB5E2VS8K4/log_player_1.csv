Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $130.  It's a fantastic deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $130, knowing that Bob values the product at $150. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to his value.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefit for both of us, highlighting the ""fantastic deal"" aspect. This builds goodwill and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By not starting at the maximum possible price, I leave space for Bob to counteroffer, allowing the negotiation to proceed naturally.
* **John as a safety net:**  The existence of John as a buyer willing to pay $100 provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob stall or become unreasonable, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That product looks great, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum:**  While $110 is better than John's offer, it's still below my minimum of $100. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than that.
* **Opportunity for a higher price:**  I believe I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering. Bob has shown interest, and I can try to meet him halfway.
* **Avoiding a rushed decision:**  I'm not going to accept the first counteroffer. By rejecting and counter-offering, I demonstrate that I'm serious about getting a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $110 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $120? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** I'm offering $120, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $130 and Bob's offer of $110. This shows a willingness to compromise and makes the offer more appealing.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect for Bob, highlighting the value he's getting. This encourages a positive response.
* **Avoiding a stalemate:** By counter-offering, I keep the negotiation going and prevent the situation from becoming a deadlock. 
* **Strategic compromise:** While $120 is still below my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise considering Bob's counteroffer."
