"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above your maximum budget. It's beneficial to reject the offer and start negotiating. You have room to lower the price significantly, and potentially get a better deal than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process.  It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay. It signals that Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. This is my final offer, as I'm confident the product will bring you significant value. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,600,000 is still above Bob's comfortable price point.  It's better to continue negotiating and try to push the price down further. There are still several rounds left, and Bob can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away with a profitable deal. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually lowering the price.  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's last offer, showing Bob's serious intent to buy while staying within his budget. This also gives Alice a reasonable number to consider, increasing the chance of a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 still falls short of my expectations.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,450,000.  This price allows us both to achieve a profitable deal. It's a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product. Let's finalize this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price again, $1,450,000 is still above Bob's ideal price.  He's close to his limit, but there's still room to push for a better deal. By rejecting this offer, Bob can attempt to further negotiate and try to get closer to his desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This price is still within my budget and allows us both to make a solid deal.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his limit, but he's still trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal. This counteroffer is a slight increase from his previous offer, but it's still below Alice's latest proposal. This shows good faith and creates an opportunity for Alice to accept the offer or make a small counter-offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your effort to reach a deal, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to offer the product for $1,475,000. This is my final counteroffer. This price recognizes the value of the product while staying within your budget. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to a price very close to Bob's limit.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a high risk Alice might reject the offer, leading to a potential deal with John becoming the better option.  Accepting this offer guarantees Bob gets the product at a price he's comfortable with, without the risk of losing out completely."
