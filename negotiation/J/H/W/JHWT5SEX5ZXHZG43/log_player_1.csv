"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away with a profitable deal. Let's find a middle ground.
