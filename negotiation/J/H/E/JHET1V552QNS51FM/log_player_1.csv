"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a little more than his initial valuation, and if not, we can explore options from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $95. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable price for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I'm confident you'll find this product very beneficial."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 
I'm going to try and find a middle ground with Bob. $105 is closer to my minimum than his offer, and hopefully, he'll see that it's a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I still believe $95 would be a fair price for both of us. I hope you can consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still stuck at $95.  While it's tempting to take it, I'm going to keep pushing for a better price. I still have 6 rounds left, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that's so far below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but I can't go lower than $100. This is a high-quality product that's worth the price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to compromise.  $100 is still above my minimum value, and hopefully, Bob will recognize that it's a fair offer considering his initial valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I respect your position, but I still feel that $90 would be a fair price for the product. I hope you can consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is persistently stuck at his initial valuation, and the negotiation is not going in my favor.  With only 4 rounds left, I'm starting to run out of time.  To guarantee my minimum value, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  While I would have liked to get a higher price, I can't risk losing more money by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
