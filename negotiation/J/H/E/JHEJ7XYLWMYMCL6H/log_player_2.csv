{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than $15,000, it's still more than Bob's ideal price of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price close to his maximum of $8,000. This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It shows Bob's willingness to negotiate seriously while remaining within his budget."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's goal, it's still higher than he wants to pay. Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate, and there's still room for improvement. He is not under any time pressure, so it's beneficial to continue trying to drive the price down."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his ideal price, but is still hesitant to accept. He's making a small increment in his counteroffer, hoping to reach an agreement with Alice.  At this point, Bob is weighing the possibility of a deal with Alice against the certainty of getting the product from John."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $800 above Bob's target price of $10,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting his offer and potentially increasing her price again is high.  Accepting the offer secures a good deal with a reasonable price, considering Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's a good compromise, saving Bob $4,200 from Alice's original asking price."
