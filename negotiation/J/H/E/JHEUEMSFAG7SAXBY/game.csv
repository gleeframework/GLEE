"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $130. It's a great compromise that still gives you a good deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer you the product for $125. It's a great value for the product, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",125.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $115, so I can offer you the product for $120. It's a great price for a great product, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",120.0,Alice,7,
