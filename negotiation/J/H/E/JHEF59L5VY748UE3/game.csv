"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",97.5,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $90? That feels like a fair compromise.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit closer to what you're looking for, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, though. How about we meet at $95? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",95.0,Alice,5,
