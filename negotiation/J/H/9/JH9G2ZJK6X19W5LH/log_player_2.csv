"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for a lower price from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what John is selling the product for.  It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice, or at least staying at $850,000, before going with John's deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you at $862,500, but I think I can do a bit better than that. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $882,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to you.

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer is still higher than what John is selling the product for.  It's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice as she's not going to get significantly lower than her current offer, and John is offering a better deal."
