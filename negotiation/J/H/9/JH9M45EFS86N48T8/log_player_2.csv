"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. There's room to negotiate a lower price, closer to Alice's value of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little too high for me.  Would you consider $12,500?"",
""product_price"": 12500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Strong:** This counter-offer is a strong opening move. It's closer to Alice's value ($12,000) but still leaves me room to negotiate if needed.
* **Polite & Direct:** The message is polite but clearly states that the initial price is unacceptable.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer will give me a good read on Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've had other interested buyers and I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While $13,500 is closer to a fair price, there's still a gap between Alice's offer and both my budget and John's alternative offer.
* **Testing Alice's Resolve:**  Alice mentioned other buyers, but it's unclear if they're serious.  Rejecting again might push her to reveal how flexible she truly is. 
* **Alternative Safety Net:**  Knowing John will sell at $15,000 gives me leverage. I can afford to be a little bolder in my counter-offer to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However, I'm on a tight budget, and $13,500 is still a stretch. How about we settle at $13,000? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  $13,000 is a compromise, splitting the difference between our previous offers. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** My message implies I'm serious about the purchase, but also firm on my budget limitations. 
* **Acceptable Outcome:**  While I'd prefer to pay even less, $13,000 is close enough to my target that I'm comfortable accepting if Alice agrees."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting a little concerned that we're getting too close to the price I'd be willing to accept from John, but I still think this product is worth more to you than $13,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,250, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $13,250 is only a slight increase from my previous offer, and it's getting very close to John's price of $15,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and pushing further could make her walk away.
* **Good Deal Overall:** Even at $13,250, I'm still saving a significant amount compared to John's offer. It's time to close the deal and get the product."
