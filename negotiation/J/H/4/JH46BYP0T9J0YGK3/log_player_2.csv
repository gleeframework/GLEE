**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is tempting, but I can likely get a better deal.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if I can push the price down further."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering its value and the potential returns, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's true value. What do you think?
