"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer of $1,400,000 is higher than Alice's valuation, it's still lower than your maximum budget and significantly cheaper than buying from John for $1,500,000. Accepting this offer saves you $100,000."
