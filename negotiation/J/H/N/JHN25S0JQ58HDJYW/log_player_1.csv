Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,550,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 (your valuation and John's offer), you have room to start high. 
* **Testing the Waters:** Offering it at $1,550,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential for a higher sale price. 
* **Negotiation Room:** This leaves space for potential negotiation while still remaining significantly above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Confidence:** The tone of the message conveys confidence in the product's value, potentially influencing Bob's perception. 

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always negotiate down, knowing your absolute floor is $1,200,000."
