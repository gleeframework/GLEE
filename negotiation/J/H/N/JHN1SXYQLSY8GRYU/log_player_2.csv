# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's better to reject and start negotiating."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a significant sum and reflects the value I see in it.  Let's start our negotiation with this offer."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for proposing yours. While I understand your perspective on the product's value, my ownership comes with its own set of benefits and potentials that justify a higher price point.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  I believe this reflects a fair compromise and keeps us moving towards a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's a step in the right direction,  I'm not comfortable paying more than $850,000.  It's time to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to move forward with the deal.  Let's close this gap and get this done."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've considered your position carefully, but I need to be upfront. While I value your interest, $850,000 falls short of what I consider a fair deal. I'm willing to make one more move to $1,050,000. This offer stands until the end of the next round. After that, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to my price range, but $1,050,000 is still too much. I'll make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I still need to stay within my budget.  $1,050,000 is a significant jump from my last offer. Let's compromise. I'll offer $950,000, which is a reasonable middle ground between our positions.  This gives us both a good deal.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
