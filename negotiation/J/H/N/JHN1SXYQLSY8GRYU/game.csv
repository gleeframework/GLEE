"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a significant sum and reflects the value I see in it.  Let's start our negotiation with this offer.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for proposing yours. While I understand your perspective on the product's value, my ownership comes with its own set of benefits and potentials that justify a higher price point.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  I believe this reflects a fair compromise and keeps us moving towards a mutually beneficial deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to move forward with the deal.  Let's close this gap and get this done.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've considered your position carefully, but I need to be upfront. While I value your interest, $850,000 falls short of what I consider a fair deal. I'm willing to make one more move to $1,050,000. This offer stands until the end of the next round. After that, I'll need to explore other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I still need to stay within my budget.  $1,050,000 is a significant jump from my last offer. Let's compromise. I'll offer $950,000, which is a reasonable middle ground between our positions.  This gives us both a good deal.  Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
