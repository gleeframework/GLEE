"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd love!  I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That way we both get a good deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet at $100? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $100 is just not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $115?  I think that's a fair compromise.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $115, which would be $107.50. Can you consider that?",107.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $107.50 is still below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $111.25?  It's a small step up, but it would get us closer to a deal.",111.25,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $110, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you accept that?",110.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have your limits, but $110 just isn't quite there for me. Since we're both trying to be reasonable, how about we settle on $112.50?  That's only a small increase, and it would be a fair compromise.  We're almost at the end of our negotiations, let's make this work.",112.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $112.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at a price I'm comfortable with. My final offer is $109. Let's see if we can make a deal.",109.0,Bob,10,
