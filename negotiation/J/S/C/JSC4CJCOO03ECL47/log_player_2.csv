"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for $13,500. This is a special opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that reflects its true worth while offering you a significant discount compared to its market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is too high. While it's lower than her stated value, it's still significantly above your maximum price. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer, you can work towards a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Opening Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's opening price, but it's still within a reasonable negotiation range. It shows you're serious about buying but want a price that works for you. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** By starting lower, you give yourself space to negotiate upwards if needed, while still staying below your $12,000 maximum. 
* **Polite and Professional:** The message maintains a positive and respectful tone, which is important for a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. Considering your budget constraints, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose to offer the product for $11,500. This still maintains a fair profit margin for us while being more accessible to your current budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is coming down, which is a good sign. However, the current offer is still $500 more than what John is offering. There's room for one more counter-offer to try and close the gap before accepting Alice's price or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for working with me. I appreciate the movement on the price. To be upfront, I do have another offer for $12,000. To make a deal work today, would you be willing to come down to that price?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Urgency:** This counteroffer lets Alice know you have another viable option, creating a sense of urgency. It encourages her to consider your offer seriously.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** You're essentially proposing a compromise by meeting Alice at your maximum price. This shows willingness to negotiate but sets a firm boundary.
* **Clear and Direct:**  The message is clear about your preferred price and the need for a decision."
