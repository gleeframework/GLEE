"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an opening offer of $900,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I think this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm making a counteroffer of $800,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you'll be happy with.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $725,000 just yet. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing $775,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not ready to accept $750,000 just yet. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing $780,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's still a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While we could continue negotiating and might squeeze out a slightly lower price, Alice has consistently moved closer to our range. At $780,000, we're getting a significant discount from both our maximum and John's offer. It's a fair deal, and further haggling carries the risk of Alice hardening her position or us running out of rounds."
