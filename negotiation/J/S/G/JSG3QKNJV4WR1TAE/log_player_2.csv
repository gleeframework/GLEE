{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's not worth accepting.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  It's a bold move that attempts to quickly establish a lower price point and gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. It's unlikely Alice will accept this first counteroffer, but it sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating with Alice in hopes of getting a better price.  You still have the option to buy from John if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest one. It's a reasonable midpoint that shows you're willing to negotiate but still aiming for a lower price. This approach keeps the negotiation moving while still giving you room to maneuver if Alice rejects the offer again."
