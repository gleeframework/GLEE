{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}

This offer gives me a good profit, while still being potentially attractive to Bob since it's significantly lower than his perceived value. It also allows room for negotiation if he rejects the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While selling to John for $800,000 is an option, I'm going to try and get closer to my ideal price by negotiating with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about $775,000?  That's a significant move on my part, meeting you closer to the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $775,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable offer of $800,000.  I'm going to counteroffer again.  I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob than selling to John."

This would be a significant win for both of us, allowing you to acquire the product at a price below its value to you, while still letting me secure a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 825000}
