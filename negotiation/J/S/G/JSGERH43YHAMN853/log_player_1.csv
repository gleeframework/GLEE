Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts with a strong price point that gives me some room to negotiate.  It also explicitly states the value to both of us, highlighting the potential benefit for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I need to try and get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,050,000? This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1050000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $950000 for it. I'm trying to find a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, it seems like we're at an impasse.  It's risky to continue negotiating with Bob, as we might not reach an agreement. Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation."
