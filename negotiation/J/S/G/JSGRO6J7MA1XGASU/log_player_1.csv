"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a strategy to see if he's willing to pay more than his perceived value.  I'm also leaving room for negotiation in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price, especially since I know John is willing to pay $100. I will try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer to show I'm willing to negotiate.  $95 is still above Bob's perceived value but closer to what he offered,  hopefully encouraging him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price. While $85 is closer to my minimum acceptable value of $100, I believe I can get a better price.  John's offer is always a safe option, but I'm willing to continue negotiating for a couple more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm further lowering my price to $90.  This shows Bob that I am serious about negotiating, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to what I believe the product is worth. With only 5 rounds left, I need to find a solution quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I am going to reject Bob's offer of $87. It's tempting to accept it, but I believe I can get a better price. With only four rounds remaining, the pressure is on, but I'm still hopeful.  I'll make one final counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 89}
```

I'm going to make one final attempt to get a price I'm comfortable with.  $89 is a compromise, but it's still higher than Bob's last offer and only slightly below what I was hoping for. If he rejects this offer, I'll sell to John."
