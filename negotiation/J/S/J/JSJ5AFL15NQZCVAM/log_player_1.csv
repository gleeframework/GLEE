Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but unfortunately, $1,200,001 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my maximum limit and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have to consider the product's value and my minimum requirements. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's try $1,150,000. It's a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
