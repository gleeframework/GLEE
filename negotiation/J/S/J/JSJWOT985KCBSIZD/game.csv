"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11000 is still a bit outside of my budget. Let's split the difference - I'm happy to offer you $10500 for the product. This feels like a good compromise for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there with $10500. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort that went into acquiring it.",11500.0,Alice,5,
