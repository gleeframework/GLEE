Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum ensures I don't appear too greedy and risk him rejecting the offer outright. 
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, this price still represents a considerable profit above my minimum ($800,000)."
