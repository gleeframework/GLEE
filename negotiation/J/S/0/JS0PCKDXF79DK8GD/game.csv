"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In light of that, I am proposing a revised price of $600000 for our premium product. This still reflects its high value, but it might better align with your current financial situation. I hope this proposal is more acceptable to you.",600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $600000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $550000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",550000.0,Bob,4,
