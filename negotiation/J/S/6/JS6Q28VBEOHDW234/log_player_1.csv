"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know it's worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my desired profit margin.  I'm keeping the message friendly and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in your product. I understand its value, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I still want to try and get closer to my desired price. I'm not in a rush to sell, and there's still time to see if I can get a higher offer.  I'll counter with a lower price than my original offer, but still higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you reaching out and I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and I offer the product to you for $13,000? It's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. Considering my budget constraints, would it be possible to lower the price further to $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  Although it's getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal.  It's important for me to get as close to my desired price as possible, even if it means potentially selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle again - I'm willing to offer the product to you for $12,800.  This is a fair price that allows me to cover my costs and still gives you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 12800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I've been considering your offers carefully. Could we agree on $12,700 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. It's just $100 below my original desired price, and I'm getting closer to closing the deal. It's also better than selling to John for $12,000. I'm running out of time, and there's a risk of Bob walking away if I reject his offer.  It's better to secure a good deal now than to risk getting nothing at all."
