Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth $2,000,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob.  
* **Justification for the price:** By highlighting the ""value and potential"" of the product, you aim to make Bob perceive the price as justified.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, the message invites Bob to share his thoughts, leaving space for potential negotiation if he finds the price too steep. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while acknowledging Bob's right to negotiate."
