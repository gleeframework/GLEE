Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll likely see."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit margin for Alice.
* **Justification:**  Framing the price with an emphasis on value and potential return on investment can make it more palatable for Bob, even if it's initially higher than he expected.
* **Safety Net:**  The worst-case scenario is Bob rejects the offer, and Alice sells to John at $800,000 â€“ her minimum acceptable price.

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's potential profit while still offering Bob a chance to acquire the product."
