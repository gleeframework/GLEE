"Alice, your initial offer of $2000000 is unfortunately far beyond my budget.  I'm very interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm hoping to receive from this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
