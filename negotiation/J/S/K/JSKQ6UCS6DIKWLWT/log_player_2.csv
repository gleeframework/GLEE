"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:** Buying from Alice at $950,000 saves Bob $250,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Bob's goal is to save money:**  Even though the product is worth more to Bob ($1,200,000), accepting Alice's offer achieves this goal."
