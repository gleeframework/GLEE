"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, the market value of this product is $1,200,000. Considering our initial conversation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the market value of the product. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $1,025,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. If you're willing to meet me at this point, I'm willing to sell. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This seems like the best move at this point. Alice is signaling this is her final offer and she's likely to stick close to her original price. Accepting at $1,025,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's offer."
