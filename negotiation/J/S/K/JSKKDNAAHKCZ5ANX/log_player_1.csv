Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects its true worth."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a strong offer that reflects the product's value to you (Alice).  This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,000,000, you ""anchor"" the negotiation at a high point. Even if Bob rejects this offer, his counteroffer is likely to be closer to your desired range.
* **John as a Backup:**  You always have the option to sell to John for your minimum acceptable price, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy it from you if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Gap:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is still a considerable distance from your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a good chance you can negotiate a better price with Bob. He seems genuinely interested and willing to ""make a serious commitment.""
* **John as Leverage:** You can use the offer from John as leverage in your negotiations with Bob, subtly implying that you have other options if you don't reach a satisfactory agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for countering. I understand your desire to find a price that works for you, and I want to make a deal happen. However, the product's value to me is significantly higher than your offer. To meet you closer to your price point, I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  I believe this reflects the product's true worth while still acknowledging your interest. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (ish):** This counteroffer represents a significant concession from your initial price, but it's still closer to your $1,000,000 minimum than Bob's $850,000. It shows flexibility while holding firm on the product's value.
* **Justification:** By emphasizing the product's value *to you,* you subtly remind Bob that you have other options (John) and are not desperate to sell at any price.
* **Open-Ended Question:** Ending with ""What do you think?"" keeps the conversation going and encourages Bob to respond. You want to keep him engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $950,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is still $100,000 below your absolute minimum. While he's moving in the right direction, the increments are getting smaller.
* **Strong Alternative:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000. This means continuing to negotiate with Bob for an uncertain outcome (and likely smaller gains) has a high opportunity cost.
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time. Accepting John's offer provides you with immediate liquidity and allows you to move on to other potential deals. 

**It's often better to walk away from a negotiation when you have a strong alternative and the other party isn't meeting your core needs.**"
