"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to further discussion and willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm ready to move forward with this purchase, but I need to be closer to my target price. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your target price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,320,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to further discussion and willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1320000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,320,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to close the deal right now if we can agree on a price of $1,280,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to both of our goals.  Let me know what you think.",1280000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,280,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,300,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm ready to close the deal right now if we can agree on a price of $1,290,000. This is a small difference, and it allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's make it happen.",1290000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to come close to my original offer. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,290,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,295,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1295000.0,Alice,7,
