"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation and signals the product's worth.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer is primarily to assess Bob's interest and flexibility. His response will give us valuable insights into his willingness to pay and negotiation strategy.
* **Alternative Option:**  We're aware of John's standing offer ($1,200,000), providing a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches our minimum acceptable price, we still have room to negotiate. We started high for a reason, and it's unlikely he immediately offered his maximum.  We'll counter to explore if we can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This reflects the true value and potential this product offers."", 
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession from our initial offer, but not dropping to Bob's price immediately.  This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming higher.
* **Justification:** We're reinforcing the product's value to justify the price, subtly countering Bob's ""market value"" argument.
* **Observation:**  We'll closely observe Bob's response to this counteroffer.  A lack of significant movement from him in the next round might suggest it's time to consider accepting his $1,200,000 offer or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,250,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the value of the product and the market. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a $50,000 profit over our guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, indicating a willingness to make a deal. However, his increments are getting smaller, suggesting we're approaching his upper limit.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate for potentially smaller gains risks losing Bob altogether and having to accept John's offer.  Closing the deal now secures a respectable profit."
