Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.  Any price within this range could potentially benefit both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal. This means getting as close to $1,499,999 as possible.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this represents a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're starting high but within a potentially acceptable range.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting ""unique value"" and ""return on investment"" aims to justify the high price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While your first offer is strong, it leaves a little room for Bob to counter-offer, making him feel more involved in the process.

**Important Note:**  Bob might outright reject this initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate down slightly. However, don't go below $1,500,000. Remember, John provides you with a strong fallback option."
