,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $10000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $7500. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $7500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000 to make this deal work.  What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $8250. Let's try to find a price we can both agree on.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. $8250 is getting closer. Let's split the difference - how about $8125?  I'm eager to get this deal done and I think this price is fair for both of us.",8125.0,Alice,5,
