Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product to you, but I believe we can find a price closer to its true worth to me. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter-offer in the next round."
