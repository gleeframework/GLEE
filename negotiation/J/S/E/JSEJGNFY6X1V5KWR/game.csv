"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $125 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Could you do it for $95? That would be a fair price for both of us, I think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 was still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I can offer you the product for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",110.0,Alice,5,
