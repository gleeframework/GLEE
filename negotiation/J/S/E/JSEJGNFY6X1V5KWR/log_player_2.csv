"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $150. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John is offering. You should definitely counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for $80."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it leaves room for negotiation while still staying well below your maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but the price is still above both your target price and what John offers. You should counter-offer again, but be ready to buy from John if Alice doesn't budge significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $125 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Could you do it for $95? That would be a fair price for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

This counteroffer shows Alice you're willing to negotiate but also sets a firm upper limit that's still below John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $125 was still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I can offer you the product for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and the price difference is now small enough that it's worth taking the guaranteed deal from John.  You've negotiated well, but sometimes the best deals are the ones you don't make in a long negotiation."
