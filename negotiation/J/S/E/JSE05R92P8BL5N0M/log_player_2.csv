"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is a good starting point, it's still above Bob's ideal price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially get a better deal.  There are 9 rounds remaining, giving Bob ample time to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  There are still 7 rounds left, so Bob has time to continue negotiating for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows him to make another counteroffer and hopefully reach a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still hoping we can find a number that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $860,000.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going below $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $882,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to be flexible to get a deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $882,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $882,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $882,500 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still a bit high.  Bob has 5 rounds remaining and can likely negotiate a lower price.  It's still advantageous for Bob to keep negotiating, especially since he has the option of buying from John for $1,000,000 if he doesn't reach a satisfactory price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $870,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm confident we can find a final price that works for both of us.  Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 870000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going below $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $895,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to be flexible to get a deal done.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get a better price.  He has 3 rounds remaining, and while $895,000 is getting close, he can likely still negotiate a lower price.  He knows he has the option of buying from John, which gives him leverage in these negotiations.  He can likely get Alice down to his ideal price point or close to it with more negotiation."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still hoping we can bridge the gap. I'm willing to go up to $880,000. This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. We're getting close to a deal, let's see if we can find a final number that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 880000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $890,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to be flexible to get a deal done.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has only one round left and is still determined to save as much money as possible.  He can potentially reach a lower price by making one more counteroffer.  While $890,000 is a decent price, Bob has the option of buying from John for $1,000,000.  He can use this leverage to try to negotiate a final price that is closer to his ideal target."

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we've been going back and forth, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal. I'm willing to go up to $885,000,  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. This is my final offer, let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 885000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's final chance to negotiate. He's raised his offer slightly to show he's serious about making a deal but still trying to get a good price.  This final counteroffer could potentially sway Alice to accept, especially if she's willing to make a small concession to close the deal."
