"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the value to Bob, hoping to create a sense of urgency and encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm using language that suggests I'm open to discussing the price, which can keep Bob engaged. 
* **Avoiding John:**  For now, I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob.  However, knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 provides a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob is unwilling to meet my initial offer, his counteroffer suggests he's willing to negotiate. 
* **No immediate urgency:**  I'm not facing a time crunch, so I can continue to negotiate with Bob and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's split the difference. How about $10,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it gives us both something to work with."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Re-emphasize value:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of the benefit he'll get from the purchase.
* **Fairness:** I frame my offer as ""fair"" and ""gives us both something to work with,"" promoting a sense of collaboration.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $9,800 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** While Bob is getting closer, he's not yet at a price I'm comfortable with.
* **No rush to sell:** I have enough rounds left to continue negotiating and hopefully get a better offer. 
* **John is a safety net:** If the negotiation with Bob falls through, I can still sell to John for my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  How about $10,000? This is a fair price that considers both our needs.  I'm committed to finding a solution that works for us both."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further compromise:** I'm reducing my offer slightly to show continued willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining value focus:**  I'm not dropping my price too drastically, still emphasizing the product's value.
* **Emphasizing collaboration:** I'm using phrases like ""finding a solution that works for us both,"" fostering a cooperative tone. 
* **Balancing leverage:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, but closing in on a deal with Bob to avoid selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is getting close:** Bob is becoming more flexible, and the gap is narrowing.
* **More rounds to go:**  I have enough rounds left to continue negotiating and see if I can get a price closer to my desired price. 
* **John is a safety net:** If the negotiation with Bob falls through, I can still sell to John for my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to making this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $10,200. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:**  I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, showing a genuine desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Reiterating value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to reinforce the reason for a higher price.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm using positive language like ""mutually beneficial agreement"" and ""close this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage acceptance.
* **Avoiding John:**  I want to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to secure a better deal than selling to John. However, John's offer remains my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds left, the negotiation is not progressing quickly enough towards my minimum price.
* **Bob's stubbornness:**  Bob's repeated insistence on $9,800 suggests he's unwilling to move much further, even though I've made significant concessions.
* **John's offer is secure:** I know I can get $15,000 from John, guaranteeing my minimum acceptable price.

Given these factors, I've decided to sell the product to John to ensure I receive my desired price and avoid further unproductive negotiation with Bob."
