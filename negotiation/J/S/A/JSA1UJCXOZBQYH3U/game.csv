"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business and could greatly enhance your operations.  To kick off our conversation, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product could bring to my business.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but I believe $900,000 undervalues the product's true potential for your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,000,000? This reflects the product's worth while still offering you substantial value.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $950,000. Could you consider meeting me at $975,000? I believe this is a fair price for the product's value and would be a good compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
