"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business and could greatly enhance your operations.  To kick off our conversation, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

My reasoning for this opening offer:

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** Starting at $1,100,000 is a strong opening gambit. It's significantly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) giving him a potential gain, while still leaving room for negotiation and ensuring I'm well above my minimum ($800,000). 
* **Gauging Bob's Position:** This first offer allows me to understand how Bob values the product and how willing he might be to negotiate.  His response will give me valuable information for future rounds.
* **Alternative Option in Mind:** I haven't forgotten about John and my $800,000 safety net. If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I'm prepared to walk away and take the guaranteed deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product could bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a tempting offer, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth and what Bob is willing to pay. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm serious about negotiating a better deal. I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation because I have a strong backup option with John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but I believe $900,000 undervalues the product's true potential for your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,000,000? This reflects the product's worth while still offering you substantial value."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but I'm still holding firm above the midpoint between Bob's offer and my initial price.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's benefits to Bob's business, subtly reminding him why my higher price is justified.
* **Seeking a Compromise:** By suggesting we ""meet halfway,"" I'm encouraging a collaborative approach and aiming for a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $950,000. Could you consider meeting me at $975,000? I believe this is a fair price for the product's value and would be a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** $975,000 is a substantial profit above my minimum selling price of $800,000. 
* **Bob's Willingness:** Bob's incremental increases suggest he's genuinely interested and is willing to negotiate. However, there's a risk he might not move much higher.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation and allows me to reinvest the earnings sooner. 

While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, the risk of Bob walking away or stalling negotiations outweighs the potential reward at this point.  Accepting $975,000 ensures a very favorable outcome."
