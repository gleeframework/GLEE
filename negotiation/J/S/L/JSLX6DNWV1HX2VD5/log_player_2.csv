Let's try to get a better price from Alice. $110 is still a bit high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?"",

We are starting with a counter offer significantly lower than Alice's starting price. This leaves room for negotiation while still staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. After considering your offer, I'm unable to accept $90 for the product. However, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about if I offer the product to you for $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

Alice is coming down, which is good. Let's see if we can push a little further.  We'll try a counteroffer a bit closer to her price this time."
