{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget of $1,000,000.  It's best to reject and try to negotiate a better price. There's no point in accepting this offer or buying from John right now, as you might be able to get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since your maximum budget is $1,000,000, offering that amount is a logical starting point. It's a clear signal of your limit and a potential point where you might be willing to close the deal.  It's also a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, hopefully encouraging her to consider a compromise."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get closer to your target price of $1,000,000.  Buying from John at this point would be unnecessary, as you're already engaged in a potentially fruitful negotiation."
