Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product.  I'm asking for $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:**  This ensures you don't sell it for less than your minimum.

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $145?  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

I'm offering $145, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility and encourages further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a final counteroffer, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal. Let's settle this. I'm willing to come down to $140. It's my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm firming up my position. $140 is a compromise, but still above my minimum. This message also conveys that I'm serious about selling, but won't go lower.  It's up to Bob now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $140, which would be $135. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $135 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I've already made my final offer.  I'm not willing to go lower. It's time to move on and sell to John for $150."
