"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to your endeavors. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I think it's a fair offer considering the significant return you stand to gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

While $925,000 is a significant discount from John's offer, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell since the product is worth less to her than to you. By rejecting this offer, you might entice her to propose a lower price, getting you a better deal."
