{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit above my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that I'm willing to work with Bob to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is my minimum value, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial offer of $130. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $115? This is still a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
