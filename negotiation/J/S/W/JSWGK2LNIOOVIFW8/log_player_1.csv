"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth at least $800,000 to me, and Bob's offer is below that. It's better to try and negotiate a higher price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This reflects a fair compromise and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $775,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I have more rounds to negotiate, so it's worth trying to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. However, $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $800,000, which is my absolute minimum. This offer reflects the true value of the product. I believe it's a fair price, and I hope you'll consider it carefully."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $800,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, which is my final offer. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm getting close to my minimum price, but Bob is still a bit lower. With only 4 rounds left, it's not guaranteed that I can push him higher. It's safer to sell to John and guarantee my desired price."
