Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95.  I believe it's worth even more, but I'm happy to offer you this price."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to haggle, but still ensures a significant profit for you.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While you could start at $100, it might make Bob feel like he's getting no deal and could lead to an immediate rejection. 

This strategy balances profit maximization with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
