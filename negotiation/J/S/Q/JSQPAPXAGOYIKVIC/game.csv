"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $11,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Can you consider that price?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $9,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of this product.  This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Can you consider that price?",9750.0,Bob,6,
