"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I want to make a deal with Bob, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $11,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While I appreciate his willingness to negotiate, $9,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $9,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of this product.  This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, I'm running out of time.  I'm going to take the safe option and sell to John for $10,000.  This ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob failing."
