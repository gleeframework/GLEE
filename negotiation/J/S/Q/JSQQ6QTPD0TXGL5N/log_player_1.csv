Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This gives me room to negotiate down while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still lower than my initial offer. I'm going to counter to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 980000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $980,000. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping he sees the value of the product and accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $920,000 is a good price, I'm not willing to accept it yet. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still slightly higher. I'm hoping he sees the value of the product and accepts, as I'm starting to get closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a stalemate. While $920,000 is still a decent price, it's getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I don't want to risk Bob rejecting my next counteroffer and ending up with a lower price than John is offering.  I'm going to accept John's offer to secure a sale at a comfortable price."
