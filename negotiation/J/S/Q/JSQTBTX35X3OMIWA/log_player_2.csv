"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Alice's offer of $9,000 is better than John's, but Bob can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  He has room to negotiate, as he values the product at $10,000 and Alice is willing to sell for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is closer to Alice's desired price of $8,000 but still leaves room for Alice to negotiate.  This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to save as much money as possible.  He is likely to be able to secure a price closer to $8,500 than $9,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,200 is still a better deal than buying from John for $10,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's not guaranteed that Alice will accept a lower offer, and the risk of her rejecting a counteroffer means he might end up paying $10,000 to John.  At this point, it's more beneficial to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a lower price than John's."
