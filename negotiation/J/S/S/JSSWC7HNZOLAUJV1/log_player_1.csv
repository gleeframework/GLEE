This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for potential counteroffers.  I'm also highlighting the product's value and uniqueness to entice Bob.  

Let me know what Bob's response is, and we can continue the negotiation strategy!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay $1400000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I believe there's room for further negotiation.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to $1,500,000."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still unable to meet your previous price. I would like to propose $1425000 as a compromise. I hope this will be acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price. While I would prefer to get even closer, the risk of losing the deal and getting only $1,200,000 from John is not worth it. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale for a price that is still quite good, exceeding my minimum by $25,000."
