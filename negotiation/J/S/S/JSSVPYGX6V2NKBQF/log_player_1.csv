{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value ($120), but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and encourage a positive response.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm indicating willingness to negotiate by asking for his opinion. 

This strategy allows me to potentially get a higher price while keeping the negotiation open and showing Bob that I'm flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** While $120 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I believe I can still secure a price closer to my desired range through further negotiation. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $150 gives me a strong position to reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $130? This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit, and I'm confident you'd still find it a great value."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my initial offer ($140) and Bob's offer ($120). 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing that he's still getting a good deal. 
* **Finality:** I'm phrasing it as a potential ""final"" offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps settle on $125? It's a bit higher than my initial proposal, but I believe it strikes a good balance between cost and your potential profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Time is Money:** Further negotiation with Bob is likely to be time-consuming, and I'm not confident I can reach a price significantly closer to my desired range.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and avoids further negotiations.  

It's a better strategy to secure a guaranteed profit from John than to risk further negotiation with Bob, which might not yield a significantly higher price."
