Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $12,000. This is a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **My Floor:**  I'm willing to accept $15,000 from John, so anything above that is profit.
* **Bob's Ceiling:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so he won't pay more than that.
* **Negotiation:**  A price of $12,000 is a fair compromise. It's a good deal for Bob, and it gets me closer to my goal of $15,000.

**Important Note:** This is a strategic approach to maximize my potential earnings.  There's always a chance Bob will counter-offer, and I'll need to assess the situation and decide whether to accept or try to negotiate further."
