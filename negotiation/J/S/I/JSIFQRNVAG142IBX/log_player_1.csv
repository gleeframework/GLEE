Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but below your minimum ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. This might make Bob perceive a price of $1,300,000 as more reasonable.
* **Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer"" add a sense of urgency and importance, potentially encouraging a quicker decision in your favor. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While you have a guaranteed offer from John, there's still room for Bob to negotiate down slightly from $1,300,000, allowing you to potentially earn even more.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a price that could be enticing compared to your initial high anchor."
