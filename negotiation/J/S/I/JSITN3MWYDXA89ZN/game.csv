"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While your offer is tempting, I need to stay closer to my asking price. How about $875,000? It's a fair compromise that acknowledges your budget constraints while allowing me to recover a significant portion of the value I've placed on this product. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",875000.0,Alice,3,
