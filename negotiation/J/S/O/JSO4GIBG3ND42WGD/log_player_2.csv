Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's very close to his maximum budget, there's still room to negotiate and potentially save some money. He can try to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Bob should accept Alice's offer. At $1,175,000, he's getting the product for less than his maximum budget and is saving $25,000 compared to buying from John.  While there's always the possibility of further negotiation, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially increasing the price further is too high. It's a good deal for Bob and he should take it."
