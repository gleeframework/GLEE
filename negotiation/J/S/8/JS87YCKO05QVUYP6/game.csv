"I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $120 for it.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on that.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. How about $140? It's a fair compromise that meets us halfway.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $140. I'm willing to pay $135 for the product, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $135 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $140? It's a good price for both of us.",140.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
I'm not willing to go back to $140. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $135. Can you meet me at this price?,135.0,Bob,8,
