"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on a product that's truly one-of-a-kind. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject the offer.  $950,000 is a good price, but you can potentially get it for even less. You have no information about Alice's minimum acceptable price, so it's worth trying to negotiate."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $800,000.  I'm very interested in this product, so let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay closer to $800000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value of this incredible product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer.  $875,000 is still a significant amount of money, and you are aiming for a lower price.  While Alice has shown willingness to negotiate, it's worth trying to push for a lower price. You can still get a good deal while saving more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $875,000 is closer to what I'm aiming for, I'm still hoping to land around $825,000.  This would be a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still looking to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for this incredible product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer.  $850,000 is a good price, and it's likely you won't be able to get it any lower.  You've already pushed the price down significantly, and it's time to lock in the deal.  Remember, you can always buy from John for $1,200,000 if you want to continue negotiating, but this is a solid price."
