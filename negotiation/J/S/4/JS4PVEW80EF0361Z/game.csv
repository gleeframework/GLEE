"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $800,000 to you, meaning you'll make a significant profit.  Let's close this deal!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, I can't accept $1,200,000.  It's still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to lower my price to $1,450,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'd like to buy the product for $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $1,150,000 is simply not enough for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's finalize this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I think $1,400,000 is still too high. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but I'd like to buy the product for $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's split the difference and agree on $1,350,000. This price gives you a good profit and allows me to achieve a reasonable outcome. With only a few rounds left, I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
