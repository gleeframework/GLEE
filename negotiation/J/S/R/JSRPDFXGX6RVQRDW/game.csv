"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a more reasonable price, but I still believe the product's value is higher than that.

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not convinced that the product's value justifies such a high price. I would like to make a final counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price given the current market conditions and the product's characteristics.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your final counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still not willing to go below $1600000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1580000. I think this is the best we can do considering the product's value and rarity.",1580000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest counteroffer, Alice. While I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise, I must respectfully decline. I am unable to agree to a price above $1400000 for the product. I hope this doesn't cause any inconvenience, and I'll consider purchasing the product from John if a deal can't be reached.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
