"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first.  You can likely get a better price than $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're close to your target price of $10,000. It's worth seeing if you can squeeze out a little more from Alice before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $10,200? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,300. This is as low as I'm willing to go. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is getting close to your target price, but it's unlikely she'll go lower than $10,300. You only have 5 rounds left, so it's better to go with John's offer and save the time and effort."
