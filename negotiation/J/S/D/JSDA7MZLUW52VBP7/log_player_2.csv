"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to purchase a valuable product for a price that I believe is fair for both of us. I understand this product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both parties. Please consider my offer of $900,000. I'm sure you'll agree it's a very attractive deal. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is below your maximum budget, you know John will sell you the product for $1,000,000.  There's a good chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice or even find another seller offering a lower price."
