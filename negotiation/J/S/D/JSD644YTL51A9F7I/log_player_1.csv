Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm offering the product for $1,400,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **John as Safety Net:** Knowing that I can sell to John for $1,500,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects this offer, I can always fall back on John. 
* **Potential for Compromise:** By starting high, I create the possibility for Bob to make a counteroffer that might be closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is far too low, and I am not willing to settle for such a low price.  Even though I could sell to John for $1,500,000, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation. 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Lowering the Price:** I've lowered my price to $1,200,000. This shows willingness to compromise while still remaining above Bob's initial offer. 
* **Closing the Gap:** I'm aiming to find a middle ground that balances my need to earn a good price with the possibility of reaching a deal with Bob.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Even at $1,200,000, I'm still earning significantly more than Bob's offer. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to settle for this yet.  I will continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to reach a deal closer to $1,200,000 or higher.  

By rejecting this offer, I maintain leverage and signal that I'm serious about getting a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is my final compromise. I'm lowering the price to $1,100,000,  which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. 
* **High Probability of Acceptance:**  At this price, I'm likely getting the best possible deal from Bob.  It's also a much better price than his initial offer and significantly higher than his perceived value of the product.
* **Minimizing Risk:** While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, and I'd have to sell to John at $1,500,000, which would mean a significant loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm not willing to accept a price this far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  

At this point, it's clear that Bob is not willing to meet me at a reasonable price, and further negotiation is unlikely to be successful. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,500,000, which guarantees me my minimum desired profit."
