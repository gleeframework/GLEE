The product is still way too expensive for Bob. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. He knows the product is worth $800,000 to him and that John is willing to sell it for that price. Therefore, Bob offers Alice his maximum price, hoping to secure a deal without having to go through John."

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible, but he's also willing to pay a little more than his absolute maximum to potentially secure a deal with Alice.  This counteroffer represents a compromise and demonstrates his willingness to negotiate."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's still determined to save as much money as possible, and while this offer is getting closer to his maximum, it's still too high.  He can continue negotiating with Alice or simply buy from John and save the time and energy involved in further bargaining."

Bob is willing to go a bit higher than his initial offer, but he's still holding firm to a price that's within his budget. This shows he's serious about buying the product, but he won't overpay.  It's a calculated risk to try to get Alice closer to his desired price."
