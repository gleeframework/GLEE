Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have John as a backup.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still being a significant profit margin for you. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offer is above Bob's perceived value ($120), but not so high that it's an immediate turn-off. There's a chance he might be willing to pay slightly more than his initial valuation.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best possible price from Bob and ensuring a sale, as you are guaranteed $150 from John if Bob declines."
