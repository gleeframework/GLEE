Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product could generate significant value for you. I'm willing to offer it at a price of $1,150,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something I know you'll find valuable."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, it's always beneficial to explore if I can earn more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win scenario. Bob gets a $150,000 discount from what it's worth to him, and I earn a $150,000 profit over my guaranteed sale.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob counters, but still ensures a significant profit margin if accepted outright."
