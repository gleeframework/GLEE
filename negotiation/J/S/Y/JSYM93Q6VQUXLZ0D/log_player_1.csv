Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and this price reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above my minimum price ($10,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to, but still ensures a significant profit if he accepts. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $10,000.  This allows me to be a bit bolder in my initial offer to Bob."
