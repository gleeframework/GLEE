"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a unique and exclusive item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's below my maximum budget of $1,500,000, I can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than I'd like to pay. While it's a bit closer to my initial counteroffer, I still think there's room for negotiation. I'll reject her offer and try to bring the price down further."

I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think about the value of this product and what I can get for it. How about we meet at $1,250,000?

Alice's offer is still too high, but it's closer to my desired price point. I'm willing to keep negotiating but will need to come up with a new counteroffer.  I want to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
