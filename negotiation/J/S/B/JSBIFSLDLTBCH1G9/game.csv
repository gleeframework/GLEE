"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a unique and exclusive item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000, which is a fair price given my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering we are both getting closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can close this deal at this price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,150,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think about the value of this product and what I can get for it. How about we meet at $1,250,000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  I'm hoping we can find a compromise here. ",1200000.0,Bob,6,
