"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $18000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $12000, so I'll offer $14000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14000. I'll offer you $16000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I'll go down to $13500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're making a final offer, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13500. I'll offer you $15000, which is still a good compromise considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,7,
