"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1200000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1050000, which is a significant amount considering its worth to me. I believe this offer is fair and reflects the value we both see in this product.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1050000 is a significant amount to you, but I'm still looking to get closer to the value I have in mind. Considering the product's worth to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the value I bring to the table.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
