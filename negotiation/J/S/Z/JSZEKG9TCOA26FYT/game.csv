"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  However, $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects both our positions.",12500.0,Bob,4,
