"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know will be incredibly valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  Let's talk about a price of $900,000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a fantastic deal for you.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you.",900000.0,Alice,1,
