"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I understand it's worth at least $15000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us. Please consider my offer of $12000. It's a significant savings for you, and it allows me to earn a good profit. If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to someone else, but I'd prefer to work with you.",12000.0,Alice,1,
