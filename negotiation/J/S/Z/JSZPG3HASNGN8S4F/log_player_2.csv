"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I understand it's worth at least $15000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us. Please consider my offer of $12000. It's a significant savings for you, and it allows me to earn a good profit. If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to someone else, but I'd prefer to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
