"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is willing to sell for at least $8,000. This means there's room for negotiation. 
*  Alice's initial offer of $9,500 is still higher than what the product is worth to you. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $9,500 is a bit high for me. How about $9,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. $9,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $9,250? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,250 is still a good deal for me. It's lower than my maximum budget of $10,000 and closer to what I'm willing to pay.
* While I could try to counteroffer again, there's a risk Alice might reject it and I might end up buying from John for a higher price. 
* Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a decent price, saving me $750 compared to buying from John."
