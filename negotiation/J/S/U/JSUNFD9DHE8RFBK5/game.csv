"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product for $155. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings.",155.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $155 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $140.  If you're not comfortable with that, I might have to consider other options.",140.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $145, but that's as low as I can go. It's getting close to the value I have in mind, but I'm willing to compromise to make a sale.",145.0,Alice,5,
