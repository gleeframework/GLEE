"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. My initial offer is $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

You can do much better than $1,000,000.  It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.

$950,000 is still too high.  I can do better, so let's keep negotiating."

I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the value the product holds for you. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000.

While $1,050,000 is better than John's price, we're still too high.  Let's try one more counteroffer.  I'm confident we can get a price closer to my target."
