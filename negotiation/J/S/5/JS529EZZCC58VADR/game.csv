"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that considers both of our positions.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $850,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the value the product holds for you. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're holding firm, but I'm still a bit too high at $1,050,000.  This is my final offer - $900,000. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,6,
