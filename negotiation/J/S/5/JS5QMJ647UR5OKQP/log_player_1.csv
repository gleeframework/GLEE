Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a significant price reduction from its true value to me, but I believe it's a fair offer considering your interest. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's still above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Attractive Offer:** $900,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $800,000.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This price allows for a few rounds of counteroffers before reaching a potential agreement. 
* **Protection:** I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below my desired profit margin. I'm aiming for a price closer to $900,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price I'm more comfortable with. 
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  I have John's offer as a fallback, giving me leverage in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This reflects both our desired price points and keeps negotiations moving forward.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price slightly from $900,000.  This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair Offer:** $875,000 is still within Bob's budget and a reasonable compromise.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm not accepting Bob's initial offer, but I'm not going too far below my desired price point. This keeps the power dynamic in my favor. 
* **Towards a Deal:** This counteroffer encourages Bob to consider making a final offer to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $875,000. It's getting closer to my budget, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go to $825,000.  This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $825,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price, especially considering I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000.
* **Time is Money:**  Negotiating further with Bob is a risk, as there's no guarantee we'll reach an agreement.  
* **Securing a Profit:**  John's offer ensures I make a profit and avoid potentially losing out on a good deal.
* **Avoiding Further Negotiations:**  I've already made concessions, and Bob's unwillingness to budge further suggests further negotiations are unlikely to be fruitful."
