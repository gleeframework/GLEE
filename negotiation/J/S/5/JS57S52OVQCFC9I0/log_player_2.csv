"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you know the value of this product is quite high. Let's make this happen!

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for you and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still provides a great deal for you.  Let's close this deal!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer. While $1,300,000 is closer to his budget, he can likely still negotiate a lower price.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if he can get it down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This price is fair for both of us, and allows us to close this deal. Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to close this deal quickly. Let's make it happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
