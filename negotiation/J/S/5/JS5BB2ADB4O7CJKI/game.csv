"I'm interested in the product, but $135 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $125 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is still a great deal for a product of this quality. Let's find a middle ground!",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $123 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",123.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $123 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $128. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",128.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $128 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $122 for the product. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",122.0,Bob,6,
