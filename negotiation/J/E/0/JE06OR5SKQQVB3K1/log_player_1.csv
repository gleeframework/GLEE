""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering the benefits it will bring to your specific needs. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and a potentially higher profit.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Starting at $1,100,000 positions the product as high-value to Bob while leaving space for a potential counter-offer that still lands above our guaranteed price. 
* **Building Rapport:** The message is framed collaboratively, inviting Bob's input and emphasizing the product's value proposition specifically for him.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
