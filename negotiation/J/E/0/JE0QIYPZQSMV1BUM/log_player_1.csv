Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, increasing Alice's profit. 
* **Avoid a Lowball:** Offering a price too close to John's offer ($10,000) would significantly decrease potential profit if Bob decides to negotiate. 

By starting the negotiation at $11,500, Alice strikes a balance between maximizing her potential profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
