,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $105 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $97.50?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $97.50 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $100. That's a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
