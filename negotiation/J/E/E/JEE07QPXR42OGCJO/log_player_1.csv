I'm not willing to drop the price that much right now. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500?  I'm sure we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.
