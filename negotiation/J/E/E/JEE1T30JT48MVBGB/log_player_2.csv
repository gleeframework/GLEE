Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I still need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get to $780,000.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $780,000. While John offers the product for $800,000, accepting Alice's offer saves $20,000 and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
