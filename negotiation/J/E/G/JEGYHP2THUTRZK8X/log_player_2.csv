"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with the value it brings to your life. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

You can do better than $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $725,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000.

``` 

Alice's offer of $725,000 is a good deal. It's still below your maximum budget of $1,500,000, and it's closer to your desired price than John's offer. It's worth accepting this offer to save money and avoid further negotiations."
