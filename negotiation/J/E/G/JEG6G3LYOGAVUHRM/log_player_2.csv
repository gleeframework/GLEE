"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$900,000 is still a significant amount over what the product is worth to Alice. There's room to negotiate a lower price, and it's worth exploring that before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price. This should encourage her to negotiate further while demonstrating my serious interest in acquiring the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is still a good deal compared to buying from John, Alice has increased her offer from the previous round. This shows a willingness to negotiate, and there's still potential to lower the price further.  It's worth continuing to explore options with Alice before settling for a price closer to her initial asking amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round.  $825,000 is a good compromise, as it's closer to Alice's desired price while still leaving room for further negotiation if she's unwilling to accept. This should signal that I'm serious about buying the product while still leaving some room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay, but her offers are getting closer to my target price. It's worth continuing to negotiate. There's a chance that she will lower her offer further in the next round, or I can make a counteroffer that she might accept. Buying from John is still a fallback option, but I want to exhaust all options with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly unwilling to go below $900,000, but she's also showing a willingness to negotiate. My last offer was rejected, so I'm increasing it slightly to $850,000, which is still significantly below her current offer but within a reasonable range. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. Hopefully, this will encourage Alice to make a final concession and accept a price closer to my target range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $990,000 is getting close to my budget, I'm still not willing to accept it. Alice has been relatively firm in her stance, but I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm hopeful that she will lower her price further or that I can make a counteroffer she'll accept in the remaining rounds.  I want to avoid buying from John if possible, and there's still a chance to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are in the late stages of negotiation, and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, albeit slowly. Increasing my offer to $875,000 signals that I'm serious about closing the deal but still trying to negotiate a lower price. This leaves some room for Alice to make a final concession if she wants to close the deal. If she rejects again, I'll have to reconsider my options and possibly consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round, and Alice's offer is still too high. While it's tempting to make one last counteroffer, the risk is that Alice might reject it, leaving me with no option but to buy from John. Since I only have one round left, it's safer to accept John's offer, ensuring that I get the product. While it's not the ideal price, it's still within my budget and guarantees I get the product.  It's better to secure a deal at a slightly higher price than risk losing the product completely."
