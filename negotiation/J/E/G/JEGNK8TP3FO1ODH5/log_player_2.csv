"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiation. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth exploring negotiation to see if you can get a better deal. You have 10 rounds, so rejecting the initial offer gives you more room to maneuver."
