Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm committed to making this deal work.  However, I'm still not able to go above $900,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I'm hoping you'll meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

While ideally, I'd like to get closer to $1 million, Bob is unlikely to budge much higher. Accepting his $900,000 offer secures a significant profit compared to his initial offer and avoids the risk of continued negotiation."
