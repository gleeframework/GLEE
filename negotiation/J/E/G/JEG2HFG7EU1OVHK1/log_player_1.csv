Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium, but I'm also prepared to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $12,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

I'm offering $13,500. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price that is closer to my value. I'm hoping this will be acceptable to Bob and we can finalize the sale."

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000.  Although I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, his counteroffers are getting too low for me to accept.  It's clear that we're not going to be able to reach an agreeable price.  John's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and it's time to move on."
