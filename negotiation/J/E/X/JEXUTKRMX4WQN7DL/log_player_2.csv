"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe you might be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and what you know you can get it for from John. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too pricey for me.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting significantly lower than my actual budget, I'm trying to gauge Alice's flexibility and leave room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Direct:** Maintaining a friendly tone is important in negotiations. I want Alice to know I'm serious but also willing to find a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your position, but $60 is too low for me. Could you do $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down a bit, but $110 is still significantly more than I want to pay.  I'll counter again and see if I can get closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $80?  That's a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Going to My Limit:** I'm offering my maximum budget now. This shows Alice I'm serious while not exceeding what I'm willing to spend.
* **Justification:** By framing it as a ""fair deal"" and meeting in the middle, I'm emphasizing the mutually beneficial aspect of this price.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:** If Alice rejects this offer, I'm ready to buy from John. It's not worth going over budget."
