"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a better price than John's $150, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to go down to $100?  "", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  That's a fair price considering the value you'll get out of it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is now offering the product at $110.
* **John's Offer:**  John is offering the product at $150.

Since Alice's offer is significantly lower than John's offer and still within Bob's budget, it's the best option. Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $40 compared to buying from John."
