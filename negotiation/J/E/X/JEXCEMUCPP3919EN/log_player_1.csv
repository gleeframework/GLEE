"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) and my minimum ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation and signals the product's high value.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer allows me to assess how eager Bob is to purchase. His response will reveal how much he values the product and how flexible he might be.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm aware of John's standing offer, providing a safety net should negotiations with Bob falter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still above his perceived value. This indicates room for further negotiation. I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum ($1,500,000) with John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While the product is incredibly valuable, I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us.  Could you consider $1,900,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price by $100,000, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying Above Bob's Value:**  This counteroffer remains significantly above Bob's perceived value, maintaining pressure for him to move closer to my range.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This price point will further reveal how much Bob values the product and his negotiation style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching My Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my absolute minimum ($1,500,000), but it's still not there yet.
* **Leverage Remains:**  We still have several rounds of negotiation, and Bob's consistent interest suggests he's willing to pay more than his initial offer. 
* **John as a Backstop:** The guarantee of selling to John allows me to continue pushing for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $1,750,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to make a significant move to close this deal quickly. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,850,000?"",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Stance:**  I'm making it clear that I'm not willing to go as low as his previous offer, setting a firm boundary.
* **Significant Concession:** By dropping $50,000, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise for a faster deal, which might encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Midpoint Offer:** This price is a midpoint between his last offer and my previous counter, signaling a fair negotiation.
* **Time Constraint:** Mentioning a ""quick close"" subtly introduces a sense of urgency, potentially prompting Bob to make a decision sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $1,800,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob has met my previous offer exactly, showing a willingness to compromise and potentially signaling this is his upper limit.
* **Good Return:** While not ideal, $1,800,000 is a substantial profit above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate for a slightly higher price carries the risk of Bob walking away, leaving me with John's lower offer. It's time to secure a good deal."
