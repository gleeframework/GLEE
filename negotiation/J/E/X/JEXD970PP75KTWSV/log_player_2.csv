"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and I believe it's also valuable to me at $120. Let's work together to find a fair price that works for both of us. How about we start at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay up to $120, but $100 is still a significant markup from Alice's own valuation of $80. 
* **Negotiation is worthwhile.** There's room for both of you to compromise and find a price that benefits both parties. 
* **Buying from John is a backup plan.**  If the negotiation fails, you can always fall back on John's offer, but it's not the most ideal outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I would like to counter your offer by suggesting a price of $95. This is higher than my initial offer but still lower than my original asking price. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While closer to your desired price, it's still above your maximum willingness to pay.  
* **Further negotiation is likely.** Alice has shown flexibility, and you might be able to push for a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is still an option.**  The negotiation is getting closer, but you're not yet at a price you're completely comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $92.50?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
