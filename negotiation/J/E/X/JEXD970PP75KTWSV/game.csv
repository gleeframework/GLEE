"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and I believe it's also valuable to me at $120. Let's work together to find a fair price that works for both of us. How about we start at $100?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can work something out.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I would like to counter your offer by suggesting a price of $95. This is higher than my initial offer but still lower than my original asking price. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $92.50?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",92.5,Bob,4,
