Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'd benefit greatly from it. I'm asking for $16,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 16000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Value-based language:**  Instead of just stating a price, the message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, potentially making him more receptive to a higher price. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message ends with an open question, inviting Bob to engage in a conversation about the price.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's personality and negotiation style, you might adjust the offer and message accordingly."
