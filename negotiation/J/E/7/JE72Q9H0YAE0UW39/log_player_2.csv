"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price that's significantly lower than its true value to me. I understand you're a discerning buyer, and this opportunity is truly something special. Consider it an exclusive offer just for you. The price is $900,000, which allows you a substantial profit margin while still representing a great deal for me.  If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay full price, so don't miss out on this chance! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
