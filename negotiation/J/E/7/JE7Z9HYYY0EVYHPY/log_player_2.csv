"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only willing to make this deal with you, so I hope you'll consider it seriously. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a great deal.
* **Polite and Professional:**  Maintaining a respectful and appreciative tone throughout the negotiation is crucial. 
* **Clear Target:** Offering a specific price shows Alice you're serious and provides a concrete starting point for further discussion.

This strategy aims for a significant discount while leaving space for compromise with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $875,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  Would you be willing to consider $800,000?  I think that would be a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Movement:**  While we're still aiming for a significant discount, increasing the offer shows Alice we're willing to negotiate and move towards a mutually acceptable price.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  Proposing $800,000 represents a compromise that's closer to the midpoint between our initial offer and Alice's current offer. 
* **Maintaining Justification:**  By reiterating our position and expressing a desire for a price closer to our initial offer, we maintain a firm but reasonable stance."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm still willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is firm:** She's stated this is her lowest price, suggesting further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result. 
* **Significant savings:** We're securing the product for $150,000 less than John's offer and $100,000 less than her initial offer. 
* **Minimizing risk:** Continuing to negotiate risks Alice walking away or us missing out on a good deal if we push too hard.

While we could try for a slightly lower price, the potential gain is outweighed by the risk of losing the current offer. Accepting at $850,000 secures a significant discount and a successful negotiation."
