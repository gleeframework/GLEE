"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $875,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  Would you be willing to consider $800,000?  I think that would be a fair compromise.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm still willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,5,
