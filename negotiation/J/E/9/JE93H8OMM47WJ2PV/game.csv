"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a fair and competitive offer of $900,000. I think this is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could we possibly work something out closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a lower price. However, I'm still not comfortable with the $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a counteroffer of $825,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we settle at $760,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer of $760,000. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",800000.0,Alice,5,
