"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a fair and competitive offer of $900,000. I think this is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a lower price. However, I'm still not comfortable with the $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a counteroffer of $825,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer of $760,000. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.
