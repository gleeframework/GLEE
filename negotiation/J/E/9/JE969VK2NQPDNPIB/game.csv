"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am currently working within a budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I understand you're working within a budget, but this product is exceptionally valuable and I need to ensure I receive a price that reflects its worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, how about $1,050,000?  This still leaves room for a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
