{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. This is a fantastic deal for something of this quality."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, there's an opportunity to earn more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than your minimum ($10,000)  leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Confident Presentation:** Highlighting the product's value and positioning the price as a ""deal"" might persuade Bob, even if the price is initially higher than he'd prefer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:**  If Bob is risk-averse, he might accept a price closer to his perceived value to avoid losing the opportunity.
* **Negotiation Skills:** This initial offer assumes you're willing to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can adjust your strategy based on his response."
