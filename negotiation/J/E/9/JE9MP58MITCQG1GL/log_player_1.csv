{""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this exceptional product.  It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for your needs. To start, I'm proposing a price of $1,750,000.  This reflects the product's high quality and potential. Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,750,000. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, considering its value to me. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is a significant drop from my initial asking price, I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum value of $1,500,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation and am confident I can get a better price from Bob.  I'm also considering John's offer as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob don't improve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to be flexible and meet you halfway. Let's try $1,550,000. This price is still within a fair range, considering the product's value to both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,550,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product, and I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to settle for anything less than $1,500,000.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price. John's offer of $1,500,000 is a safety net, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a better deal from Bob just yet."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $1,450,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still firm on the value of this product.  Let's split the difference - I'm proposing $1,500,000 as a final compromise.  This price reflects the product's true value and allows for a successful deal for both of us.
