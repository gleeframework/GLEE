{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offers are getting progressively higher, but they're still above your target range.  It's becoming riskier to continue negotiating with Alice, as you're approaching your maximum price point.  However, rejecting the offer keeps you in the game and allows you to continue trying to get a better deal. If this offer is rejected, you might want to start considering your options with John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting dangerously close to your limit.  This counteroffer is a significant jump from your previous offer, showing Alice that you're serious about reaching an agreement.  However, it's still below her current offer and gives her a chance to accept a deal that's profitable for her.  If this is rejected, you might want to consider John's offer."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $960,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now above your maximum price point, and it's very likely that her next offer will be even higher. You've already exhausted most of your negotiation room and it's unlikely you'll be able to get a better price from Alice. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $1,000,000.  While it's not your ideal price, it's still within your budget and guarantees you get the product."
