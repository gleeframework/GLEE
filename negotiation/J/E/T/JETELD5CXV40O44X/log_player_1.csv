Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be very useful to you. I'm asking for $100, but I'm open to reasonable offers."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Gauge Interest:** By opening at $100, Alice can gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts immediately, she knows she could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects, she can negotiate down towards $80.
* **Alternative Option:** Alice has the security of knowing John will buy the product for $80. This gives her leverage in the negotiation, as she doesn't *need* to sell it to Bob for less than that.
* **Open to Offers:**  By stating she's ""open to reasonable offers,"" Alice encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation and potentially meet somewhere in the middle."
