"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I believe this is a fair price given its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum price of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is still above Alice's value of $8,000, but it is a significant discount from the initial offer and within Bob's budget.  This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate and potentially reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. How about $10,500? That's a fair compromise and still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John for $12,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John or Alice refusing to budge further outweighs the potential for a slight price reduction.  Accepting this offer secures the product for Bob at a good price."
