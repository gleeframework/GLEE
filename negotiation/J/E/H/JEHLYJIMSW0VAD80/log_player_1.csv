Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a fair price:** It's significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000, but it also leaves room for negotiation and potentially getting closer to the $15,000 value for Bob.
* **It's clear and concise:**  The message is friendly and direct, leaving no room for ambiguity.
* **It sets the stage for counteroffers:** By mentioning the value to Bob, you subtly encourage him to consider a counteroffer if he's interested. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this with me.  However, I'm not quite ready to go that high yet. I'm willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, it's still below what I'm hoping to get.  I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my bottom line. Let's try to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
