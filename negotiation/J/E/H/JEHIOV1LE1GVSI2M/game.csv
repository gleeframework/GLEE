,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested, but $130 is a bit out of my price range.  How about $115?  I'm hoping we can find a deal that works for both of us.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate.  $115 is a bit low for me, but I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $125? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $125 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $120, which is my absolute maximum.  It would be a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,4,
