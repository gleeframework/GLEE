I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $100.  I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum price of $150 as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

$120 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price slightly to $140.  This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. Hopefully, this is close enough to his valuation to encourage him to accept."

Bob's offer of $110 is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum.  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a price I'm comfortable with."
