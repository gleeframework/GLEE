"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is within your budget, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice ($100). There's room for negotiation to get a better price."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  Would you consider $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob, but I've got to make a profit too. I can meet you in the middle at $112.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $112.50 is still a bit high for me, considering I'm willing to pay up to $120 from John. There's still room to negotiate and get a better price. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $112.50.  How about we settle at $110?  That's a good price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy it right now."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go back to $112.50, Bob. I think we were close, and I'm willing to meet you at $111.50. That's the lowest I can go 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $111.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $111.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $111.5 is very close to my maximum budget of $120. While I'm still saving $8.50 compared to buying from John, I'm not comfortable continuing to negotiate. The likelihood of getting a lower price from Alice is diminishing, and I'm at risk of losing the deal altogether if she becomes unwilling to negotiate further. Buying from John guarantees I get the product for a price I'm comfortable with, even if it's slightly higher."
