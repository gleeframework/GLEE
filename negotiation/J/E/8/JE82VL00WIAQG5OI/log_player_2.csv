"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You can get the product for less than $9,500 from Alice, so rejecting the offer is the best option. You can make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still higher than her minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing you to save a considerable amount of money compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than your previous offer, but still higher than your ideal price. It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice rejected your previous offer, it's reasonable to raise your offer slightly.  $9,000 is still a good deal for you and allows some room for Alice to negotiate. This should keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your maximum budget, but it's still higher than what you want to pay.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $12,000. You've already saved a substantial amount of money compared to John's initial offer, and continuing to negotiate with Alice might not result in a significantly better price.  It's time to secure the product and avoid potentially getting stuck in a drawn-out negotiation."
