Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is lower than I expected, but I'll think carefully about my next move. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, I'm not willing to sell it to him for $11,000. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer.
