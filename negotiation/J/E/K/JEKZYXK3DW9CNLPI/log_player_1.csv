"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to kick off the negotiations. Given its value, I'm offering it to you at $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally good practice to start negotiations with an offer slightly higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for compromise and gives the impression that you believe the product is worth a significant amount.
* **Not Too High:**  While starting high is good, being unreasonable could scare Bob away. Offering it at $1,100,000 leaves a good potential profit margin while still being within a reasonable range of Bob's perceived value. 
* **Setting the Tone:** This opening offer establishes a starting point for negotiation and signals that you're aiming for a price closer to the higher end of the value spectrum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still a considerable distance from my starting point and leaves a lot of potential profit on the table.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep drop. Rejecting this offer will:

* **Signal Firmness:** It shows Bob that I'm serious about the product's value and not willing to settle for a low price quickly.
* **Open Door for Counter:** It gives me the opportunity to propose a counteroffer that brings the price closer to my desired range. 

I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $950,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us. Would you consider $1,050,000? This price reflects the true value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've lowered my price by $50,000 from my initial offer, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Holding Ground:** However, I'm not drastically reducing my price. The new offer is still significantly higher than his,  maintaining a strong negotiating position. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""true value"" of the product reinforces its worth and justifies the higher price point. 
* **Positive Language:** The message emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial agreement, fostering a collaborative atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a strong deal and meets my criteria for a successful negotiation:

* **Significant Profit:** This price is $200,000 above my minimum acceptable price, representing a substantial profit.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  We've both made concessions to reach a price point close to the middle of our initial positions, indicating a fair negotiation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's also the risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away. Accepting now secures a great deal and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
