"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. What are your thoughts?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is a little too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only justify spending around $6,000. Would that be something you'd consider?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $9,500. This is my best price for now.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $9,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Would you consider $7,500? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $8,200. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",8200.0,Alice,5,
