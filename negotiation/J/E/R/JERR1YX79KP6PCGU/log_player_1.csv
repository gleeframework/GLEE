Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above Bob's perceived value:**  It gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **Below your minimum:**  It leaves you some margin to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Reasonable:**  It's a fair price given the product's worth to both of you.

By offering a specific price and a clear message, you're initiating a structured negotiation. This sets a tone of professionalism and allows you to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum.  While I want to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell for so far below my value.  I'll counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's meet in the middle on this."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
