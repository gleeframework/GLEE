"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and your interest, I propose a price of $9,500 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a good price, Bob can potentially do better.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a good starting point for negotiation. He's  showing his willingness to negotiate while also establishing his price limit.  He's leaving room for compromise in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet my asking price. Considering the value of the product and your budget, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $9,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's price, but it's still above his desired limit. Bob should continue negotiating, as he is still within range of a price he's willing to pay and has not exhausted his rounds.  There is potential for further compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob continues to push for a lower price while showing flexibility.  He's proposing a compromise that's closer to his target, leaving room for Alice to counter if necessary.  He's also emphasizing that this price is ""fair"" for both of them, appealing to Alice's sense of reason."
