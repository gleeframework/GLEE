"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a rare find and I think you'll really appreciate its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $115 is tempting, you know your upper limit is $120 and you have an alternative seller. Rejecting might lead to a better counter-offer from Alice, or you can always fall back on John's offer."
