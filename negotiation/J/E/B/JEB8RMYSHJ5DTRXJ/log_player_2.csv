"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1250000.  It's a fantastic deal for you, and it allows me to still get a good price for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can still get the product from John at a price he's comfortable with."
