"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I still need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to go up to $11,200, which is still a good compromise considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
