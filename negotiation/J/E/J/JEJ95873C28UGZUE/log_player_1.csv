Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can get closer to the value I believe the product is worth to me.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $10,750. I think this is a fair price considering the value I believe the product is worth to me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still holding out for a better price than $10,750. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I want to see if I can squeeze out another couple of hundred dollars. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,450 is only slightly less than what I could get from John, I'm still holding out for a higher price. The product is worth more to Bob, and I believe I can still push for a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
