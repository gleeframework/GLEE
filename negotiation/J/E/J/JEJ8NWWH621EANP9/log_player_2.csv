Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the minimum I'm willing to sell for. How about we try $73? It's a small increase, but I think it's still a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $73. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $73
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice is signaling she's firm on her price and unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $73 secures a reasonable discount while avoiding the risk of the deal falling through entirely."
