Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. $12,000 is too far below my minimum price. I'll see if I can get a better price from Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 isn't quite enough for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $17,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $17000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $14000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better price. I'll see if I can get him to go a little higher in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $14,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,500?  This would give me a fair profit and allow you to get the product you want. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $15500 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $13500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is below my minimum price of $15,000.  I'm not confident that I can get a better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds.  Therefore, I'll sell the product to John for $15,000."
