"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than my usual asking price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than my budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if I can get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is a substantial discount from my original price and reflects your budget constraints.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target price of $800,000."

This represents a significant compromise on my end, but it also allows us both to walk away with a reasonable deal. Let's meet halfway.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's price is getting closer to my target, it's still a bit too high. I'm willing to take another risk and see if I can get closer to $800,000 with a final counteroffer. If I fail, I can still buy from John."
