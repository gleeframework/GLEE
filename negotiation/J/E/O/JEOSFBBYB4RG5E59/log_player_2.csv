"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $12,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth exploring negotiation before jumping to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is my best offer."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's also above your maximum willingness to pay. This shows Alice that you are serious about buying the product but also have a budget constraint."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is still above my budget, but it's closer to my maximum willingness to pay. I'm not willing to pay that much yet, so I'll counteroffer again to try to get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'll offer $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. It also remains below my maximum budget, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering $10,000 for the product, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum willingness to pay. I have a few more rounds to try and negotiate a lower price, so I will reject her offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still more than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs and allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small increase from my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate further. It remains below my maximum budget and shows Alice I'm serious about reaching a deal, but also highlights my financial constraints."
