"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is my best offer.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'll offer $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering $10,000 for the product, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still more than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs and allows us to close the deal.",9500.0,Bob,6,
