"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a valuable piece, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in your product but I can only offer $8000 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to try to get a better price from him.  $8,000 is not worth the risk of selling to John at the moment.  I'll try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $12,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $12000 is still higher than what I can afford. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10000. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the same as John's offer, so there is no reason to continue negotiating. Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal quickly and achieve my minimum acceptable price."
