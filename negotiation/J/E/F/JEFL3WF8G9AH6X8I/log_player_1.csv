{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's a great deal for you and a fair price for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum, but I'm willing to negotiate.  We'll see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to give up on getting closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $100? It's still a great deal for you and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $100. I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm confident that I can get a better price with further negotiation. I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $100 at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $95 is still a little too low for me.  I'm feeling generous, though, so let's split the difference.  How about $97.50? That's a good price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
