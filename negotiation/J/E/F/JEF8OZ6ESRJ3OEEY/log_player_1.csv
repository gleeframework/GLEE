Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's my offer to Bob:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to your operations. While my initial asking price is $1,500,000, I'm open to negotiating a fair deal that benefits us both. What price point did you have in mind?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Don't undervalue:** I know John will buy the product for my minimum price, so I shouldn't offer it to Bob below that. 
* **Start high, but be flexible:** By starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), I leave room for negotiation. The message also emphasizes my willingness to find a mutually beneficial price, making Bob more likely to engage.
* **Gather information:** By asking Bob about his price point, I gain valuable information about his budget and willingness to pay. This will inform my negotiation strategy moving forward. 

**Overall:** This approach aims to maximize profit while leaving the door open for a successful negotiation with Bob."
