This is a good starting point for negotiation.  $800,000 is a decent offer, but there's likely room to save more money.  It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to come down further."

Alice has come down significantly.  You're still saving a good amount of money compared to John's price, and it's likely Alice won't budge further. Accepting her offer is the best choice at this point."
