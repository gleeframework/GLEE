"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better for you:**  You value the product at $10,000 and Alice is offering it for $9,000. This means you save $1,000 compared to buying from John.
* **You don't have to worry about John:**  By accepting Alice's offer, you avoid the risk of John potentially raising his price or not having the product available."
