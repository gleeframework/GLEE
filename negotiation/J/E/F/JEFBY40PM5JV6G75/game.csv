"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $10,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we settle on $9,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can we meet in the middle at $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,250 is still a bit below what I can accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I'm happy to sell the product for $9,400.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to come to an agreement.",9400.0,Alice,5,
