Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate down slightly. 
* **Ensure a Sale:**  The price is still significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($120), guaranteeing a profit even if Bob negotiates down a bit.

This strategy balances ambition with the need to secure a sale at a price advantageous to you."
