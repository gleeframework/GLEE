"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $15,000 for the product.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $6,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $9,500. This is a fair compromise that should work for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you do $7,000?  That would be a great price for me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $8,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,5,
