Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The price of $925,000 provides a potential $75,000 negotiation buffer while still staying significantly above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially accept your initial offer.

This strategy balances ambition with the need to secure a deal that's significantly better than your backup option with John."
