{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's in great condition and worth every penny!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to Bob's value of $120, but I'm also keeping in mind my minimum value of $100 and the alternative offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I can still try to squeeze out a bit more. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a little higher than $110. How about we split the difference and go with $112? That's a fair compromise, and it's still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 112}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $108? That's the lowest I can go and still feel good about the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $108 is just above my minimum price of $100.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's not worth risking losing the sale entirely. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a price that's still profitable."
