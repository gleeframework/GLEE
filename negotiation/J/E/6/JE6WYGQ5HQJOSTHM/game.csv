"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this opportunity.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you'll be getting from the product. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",920000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position.  While I value the product, $920,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $880,000.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",880000.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're willing to meet me at $880,000, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still a bit above that number. Let me see if we can meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
