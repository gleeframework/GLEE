Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1100000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. I believe this price reflects its value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a decent amount, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1000000 is too high. I'm willing to pay $950000 for it. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the value I see in the product.

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his offer is still below my minimum threshold.  I've reached the point where I'm willing to settle for John's offer to ensure I receive at least the $1,000,000 I need."
