# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to part with it for $1100000. This price reflects its unique value and potential.  What are your thoughts?

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $900000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1000000. This price is fair, considering the product's worth and potential. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.
