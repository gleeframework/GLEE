Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. This is a great deal considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so starting at $10,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant gain for Alice.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the price. 
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning a public listing, Alice subtly reminds Bob that he could lose the opportunity if he doesn't act.  The $8,000 backup offer from John provides Alice with a safety net, ensuring she doesn't have to go below that price."
