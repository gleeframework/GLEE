# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,350,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000.

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still within your budget, and you've already negotiated a lower price from her initial offer.  It's a good deal considering you could buy from John for $1,200,000."
