Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm happy to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This price aligns with its value to me and allows for a fair margin for you. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
