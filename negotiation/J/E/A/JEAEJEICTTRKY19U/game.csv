"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $9,500. This still allows you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can close this deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,500, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. Would you be willing to consider $8,200?",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but $8,200 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal. Let's make this happen!",9000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to revisit my previous offer of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand we're both trying to get a good deal here, but $8,500 just isn't working for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?",8750.0,Alice,7,
