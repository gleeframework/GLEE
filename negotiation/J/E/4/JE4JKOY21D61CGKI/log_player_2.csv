You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. $7,750 is still a bit low for me, though. Let's try $8,250. That's a good middle ground, and I think it reflects the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,250.  At this point, it's more beneficial to cut negotiations and buy from John for $8,000. This avoids further back and forth and secures the product at your target price."
