Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $80, so he might be willing to pay a bit more, especially if he sees value in it.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're willing to accept $120, so you have some wiggle room to negotiate.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** Bob knows exactly what you're proposing. 

By starting with a slightly higher price, you leave room for negotiation while also maximizing your potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would you consider selling the product for that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum of $120.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for a price that significantly undervalues the product.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  I believe that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter your offer at $80. I hope this meets your expectations and we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly refusing to budge from his $80 offer.  While I could continue to counteroffer, there's a high chance he'll simply reject again.  It's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement that works for both of us.  Since I have a guaranteed sale with John for $120, it's in my best interest to stop negotiating with Bob and accept John's offer."
