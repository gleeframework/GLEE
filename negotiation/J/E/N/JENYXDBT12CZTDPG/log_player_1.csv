"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, giving Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit. I'll be watching Bob's reaction and adjusting my strategy based on his responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counter with $140. This is a compromise,  moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a decent profit margin.  Hopefully, this will be enough to entice him to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, we're already at Round 4, and it's getting risky to keep rejecting.  $130 is a good profit, and I'm comfortable selling at that price."
