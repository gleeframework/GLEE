"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since your maximum budget is $1,500,000 and Alice's initial offer is exactly that amount, there's no room for negotiation. You have nothing to gain by trying to counteroffer, as Alice might not budge. Buying from John immediately guarantees you get the product at your maximum price point."
