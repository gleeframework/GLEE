Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium over his perceived value.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob accepts:
    * You earn $150,000 more than your minimum.
    * Bob gets the product for $50,000 less than its worth to him.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly."
