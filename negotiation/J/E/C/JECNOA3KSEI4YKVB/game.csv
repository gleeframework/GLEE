"Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, but $1,800,000 falls a bit short of my expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",1900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm ready to come down a bit further, but $1,900,000 is still cutting it too close to my bottom line. How about we make it $1,950,000 and call it a deal? This offer represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and I believe it's more than fair.",1950000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you consider that?",1900000.0,Bob,6,
