Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, but $1,800,000 falls a bit short of my expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm ready to come down a bit further, but $1,900,000 is still cutting it too close to my bottom line. How about we make it $1,950,000 and call it a deal? This offer represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and I believe it's more than fair.
