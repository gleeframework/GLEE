"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so I'm giving him room to negotiate.  I'll also be watching for any signs that he's willing to go higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if he's willing to come up.  If he's not, I can always sell to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm going to drop my price a bit, but still staying above my minimum.  I'm hoping to meet Bob in the middle.  If he's serious about buying, he should be willing to pay closer to my original offer."
