Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to my maximum budget, I'm confident that I can negotiate a lower price. I'll continue to counteroffer and see if I can get a better deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my target price, but I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation to see if I can get the price down to $1,000,000.  If this round doesn't work out, I'll buy from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

This is my final offer. I'm offering Alice her minimum price, which is the same price John is selling for.  If Alice rejects this, I'll buy from John.  This forces Alice to make a decision: accept my offer and sell or lose the deal."
