"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you at $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere within my budget. I am interested in purchasing the product for $150. Please let me know if this is possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is the highest he's willing to go and it's still below my minimum. I'd rather take the guaranteed $150 from John."
