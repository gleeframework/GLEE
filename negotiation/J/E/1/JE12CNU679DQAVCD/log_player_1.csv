"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price. I'm hoping Bob will be interested enough to counteroffer, allowing us to find a price that works for both of us.  If he rejects, I can always fall back to John's offer of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell the product for $500,000, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round.  While I could sell to John for $1,500,000, I'm hoping I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it's a compromise from my initial offer and closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price for Bob, while still leaving me with a good deal. If he rejects, I can either counter again, or consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still far too low.  I'm not willing to sell the product for $600,000. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round.  While I could sell to John for $1,500,000, I'm hoping I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,600,000. This is getting closer to Bob's offers, and I'm hoping that it will be appealing enough for him to accept. I'm still getting a good price for the product, and I'm confident that I can get a better deal with Bob than I can with John. If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of rounds, and Bob's offers are still far too low. I'm not willing to risk going lower than $1,500,000.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
