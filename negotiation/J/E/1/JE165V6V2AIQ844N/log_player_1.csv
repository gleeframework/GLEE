Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic [product name] and I think you'd really appreciate it!  I'm asking for [price slightly higher than $80, for example $85].  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** The message is friendly and engaging, highlighting the potential value of the product for Bob.
* **Price:**  The price is set slightly higher than the minimum acceptable value ($80) for Alice, but not too high to scare Bob away. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground where Alice can get a higher price than John's offer while also making Bob feel like he's getting a good deal."
