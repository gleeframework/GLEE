Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I anticipate, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have other potential buyers lined up."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but still leave room for negotiation with Bob.
* **Time Value:**  Selling to John is a guaranteed $12,000, but there might be a slight delay. Offering a slightly lower price to Bob could lead to a faster sale.
* **Strategic Messaging:**  By mentioning ""other potential buyers"" and ""demand,"" Alice creates a sense of urgency and value. 

This offer balances a strong opening price with strategic communication to increase the chances of Bob accepting while still aiming for a price higher than John's offer."
