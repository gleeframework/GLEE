You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 might be a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $120. Would you be interested in that price?

You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $80 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $120, which is $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $100.  It's better to cut your losses and take the guaranteed offer from John at $80."
