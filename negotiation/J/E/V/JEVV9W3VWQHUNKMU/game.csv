"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  However, $150 is a bit high for my budget right now.  I'd be happy to pay $125 for the product.  What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make a decent profit while still ensuring a good deal for you.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $135. That's closer to what I had in mind. However, I'm still hoping to close the deal at $130.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would help me stay within my budget. Would you consider this final offer?",130.0,Bob,4,
