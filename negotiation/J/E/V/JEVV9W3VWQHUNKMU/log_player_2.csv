"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I'd like to offer you. It's worth at least $120 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point. It's worth exploring if you can get a lower price before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  However, $150 is a bit high for my budget right now.  I'd be happy to pay $125 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lowering the price:** I've started with a significant price reduction, aiming to get Alice to consider a price closer to her minimum. 
* **Showing good faith:**  I've acknowledged her initial offer and expressed my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This counteroffer still leaves room for Alice to counter back with a higher price, but gives her an incentive to move towards my desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make a decent profit while still ensuring a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, but it's still above my budget.  There's room for a lower counteroffer to potentially close the deal closer to my ideal price point. 
* **Avoid getting stuck:**  Accepting too quickly could mean missing out on a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $135. That's closer to what I had in mind. However, I'm still hoping to close the deal at $130.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would help me stay within my budget. Would you consider this final offer?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, hoping to pressure Alice into accepting.
* **Reasonable counteroffer:** The $130 offer is a small but significant drop from $135, suggesting I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I reiterate that this price is fair for both of us, emphasizing mutual benefit.
* **Budget constraint:** I subtly reiterate my budget limitations, hoping to create a sense of urgency for Alice to accept."
