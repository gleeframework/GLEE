"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth in the market."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and our minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the product's ""unique value and potential,"" we aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a higher level.
* **Leaving John as Leverage:**  While John's offer is our safety net, we don't reveal this option yet. It's our leverage if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than our starting point and our minimum acceptable price. Bob's message suggests some flexibility, so we'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway – let's agree on $2,050,000, and we'll have a deal."", 
""product_price"": 2050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, But Hold Firm:** We're signaling willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer. However, the significant drop from our initial price demonstrates we're serious about finding a middle ground, but not desperate.
* **Strong Justification:**  We reiterate the product's value without directly dismissing Bob's perception.
* **Clean Number:** The offer of $2,050,000 feels deliberate and suggests a well-calculated position. 
* **Time Pressure (Implicit):**  While we have rounds remaining, each counteroffer carries the implicit message that our time is valuable, and we have other options (John's offer)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $2,050,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's try $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching the Bottom Line:** Bob's offer is getting close to our absolute minimum. While he's showing willingness to negotiate, we're not there yet.
* **Maintain Credibility:** Accepting at this point might signal we were willing to go much lower, potentially leaving money on the table.
* **John as Leverage:** We're now close enough to John's offer that it becomes a real alternative if Bob doesn't move significantly in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  I need you to understand that this offer is a significant reduction from my initial asking price, reflecting my desire to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000, but that's my absolute best. This is a rare opportunity, and I'm confident you won't find this value elsewhere."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer shows Bob we're serious about reaching a deal but holding firm on a price that is significantly above both his last offer and our absolute floor.
* **Highlighting Value:** We're reminding Bob of the product's unique value and implying scarcity to incentivize him to agree. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating this is our ""absolute best,"" we create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to respond quickly.
* **Preparing for Alternatives:**  We're getting close to a point where walking away and accepting John's offer becomes a very real option if Bob doesn't meet our price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,900,000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's try $1,700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Strong:**  While $1,700,000 is tempting, we've established a firm stance, and accepting now might signal weakness.  
* **Limited Rounds Remain:**  We only have a few rounds left, and Bob needs to understand the seriousness of the situation.
* **John's Offer is Close:**  We're willing to walk away at this point if Bob doesn't significantly increase his offer. The risk of losing the deal is now part of our strategy."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end.  Let me be completely transparent – I have another interested buyer who sees the full value in this product. I'm offering you this deal because I believe in your vision for it. However, I need a commitment from you.  My final offer is $1,825,000. This is your last chance to acquire this product before I move forward with the other offer."", 
""product_price"": 1825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Competition:** We're revealing John's offer (without specifics) to create a sense of urgency and competition. This leverages Bob's potential fear of missing out.
* **Finality and Scarcity:**  We're clearly stating this is our ""final offer"" and implying that the opportunity to purchase the product is about to disappear. 
* **Slight Concession, Strategic Position:**  We're making a small concession ($75,000), but positioning it as a final act of good faith rather than a sign of desperation. The price of $1,825,000 is our compromise – still significantly above our minimum and designed to elicit a yes/no response from Bob.
* **High Stakes:** We're now at a point where we're willing to walk away and take John's offer if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your transparency, but I'm still not convinced that $1,825,000 is the best price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's try $1,750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is Not Budging:**  Bob's latest offer is only a small increase and still significantly below our ""final offer."" It's clear he's unwilling to meet our price point. 
* **Limited Time, High Risk:** We've shown our hand, and Bob is unlikely to move significantly in the remaining rounds. Continuing negotiations risks losing both Bob and John's offers.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John's offer provides us with our desired minimum profit and removes the uncertainty of continuing with Bob. It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed deal."
