Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can move forward."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,150,000 is a strong starting point. It's considerably more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for negotiation if needed.  
* **Confident Tone:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and my confidence in it, subtly encouraging Bob to accept the offer. 
 
**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  I don't know how much Bob is willing to pay above his perceived value.  There's a risk he might find the price too high and reject it outright.
* **Negotiation:** If Bob counters, I'm in a good position. I can be flexible knowing I have a guaranteed buyer (John) as a fallback."
