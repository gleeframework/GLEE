"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll find valuable. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,500,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that's a beautiful product you have there, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 to start the negotiation.  What do you say?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $500,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but $750,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll counteroffer at $1,100,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
