Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a beautiful product you have there, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 to start the negotiation.  What do you say?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $500,000 is a bit too low for me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but $750,000 is still below my minimum price.

This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
