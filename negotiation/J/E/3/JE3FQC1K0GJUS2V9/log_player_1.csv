Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $140. I think you'll find it's a good value considering its worth to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I can likely do better. I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down to $135. This still gives me a good profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 135}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my target, but I'm still within striking distance of a better price. I believe I can push him a bit further without risking losing the deal entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your continued interest.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $131.50 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 131.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short of the value I'm looking for. I'm willing to pay $129 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $129. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $129
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $129 is only $1 less than my minimum acceptable price of $130.  There are only 4 rounds left and it is highly likely that Bob will not budge much further.  Selling to John at $120 would result in less profit than accepting Bob's offer."
