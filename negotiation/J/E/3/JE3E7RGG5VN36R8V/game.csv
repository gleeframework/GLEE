"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident this price still represents a great value for you. Let's try to work together to make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
