Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

This offer starts the negotiation with a price close to Bob's perceived value, but still allows room for negotiation and potential profit for me. I'm aiming for a price closer to $10,000 but I'm prepared to potentially settle for less if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, it's still a bit low. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $9,500. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but I'm still aiming for a price that is closer to my desired value. This counteroffer shows flexibility but also demonstrates that I'm not willing to settle for Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,600 is a significant improvement from his previous offer and is closer to my minimum value.  While I'd prefer to get even more, it's likely that further negotiations will just drag things out and potentially result in selling to John for $8,000. I'll accept Bob's offer to secure the sale and move on."
