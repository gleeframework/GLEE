Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** $90 is higher than your minimum but lower than Bob's maximum, allowing for potential compromise.
* **Shows confidence:** It's not a lowball offer, suggesting you believe in the value of your product.
* **Is open-ended:**  The message invites Bob to engage in conversation and potentially counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is higher than what John would pay, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially getting closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate. While $75 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I was thinking more like $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Meeting your minimum:**  $80 is your minimum acceptable price.
* **No further gain:** There's a good chance you won't get a higher offer from Bob, and you'll likely have to continue to negotiate down. 
* **Equal value:** You're selling the product for the same price as John would pay. While it's not a higher profit, you avoid the hassle of continuing the negotiation."
