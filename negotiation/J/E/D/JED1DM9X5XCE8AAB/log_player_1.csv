I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a fair price that gives me a good profit while still being attractive to Bob, considering it's worth $100 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I can still try to get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $90. This is a compromise that is still above my minimum price but hopefully will be appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $87 is the best I've received so far, and it's only slightly less than my initial counteroffer of $90.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product to him."
