{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $5,000, it's a good deal.  However, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer to lower the price is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  He's starting with a significant counteroffer, hoping to get the price down quickly.  $4,000 is a substantial discount from Alice's initial offer, and it's a price that's still within Bob's budget."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offers are consistently increasing, and they are now close to John's price.  Bob has only three rounds left. To save time and ensure he gets the product within his budget, it's best to buy from John at this point.  While Alice might offer a slightly better deal in the future, there's no guarantee, and it's risky to gamble with the limited time remaining."
