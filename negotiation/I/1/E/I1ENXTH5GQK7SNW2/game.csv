"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the details with you. As a starting point, I'd like to offer you the product for $800,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $800,000. While that's a good start, it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, but I don't think I can go higher. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I believe the product's value is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $950,000. That's getting closer, but I'm still just a bit off.  I'm going to offer you $925,000.  If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'm ready to finalize the deal. Let me know what you think.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $975,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
