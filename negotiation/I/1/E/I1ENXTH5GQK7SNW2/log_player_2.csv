"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the details with you. As a starting point, I'd like to offer you the product for $800,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly below my maximum price of $1,200,000. It's a good starting point, but I have room for negotiation and can likely get a better price.  I'll reject the offer and see if I can get Alice to come up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $800,000. While that's a good start, it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, but I don't think I can go higher. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I believe the product's value is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not willing to pay $950,000. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle. I'm hoping to get the price down to $925,000. If she rejects, I'll have to seriously consider buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $950,000. That's getting closer, but I'm still just a bit off.  I'm going to offer you $925,000.  If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'm ready to finalize the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $975,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, and I'm running out of time.  It's only $50,000 more than my last counteroffer.  I think I'm going to accept this offer and close the deal."
