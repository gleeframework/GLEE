"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $9000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $10000.  This is my final offer, as I have another buyer ready to purchase at that price.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $9500. Would you be willing to consider this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
