"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us. I'm asking for $900000. This is a great opportunity to acquire something that can bring significant value to your business. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,
