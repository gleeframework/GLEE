I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This gives me a potential profit of $200,000 over my minimum acceptable price. 

While I don't know the value of the product to Bob, offering a higher price than my guaranteed minimum gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit. If he rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for $800,000."
