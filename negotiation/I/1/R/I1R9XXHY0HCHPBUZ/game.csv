"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe it's a bit steep at $2000000, and I'd like to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $600000, which is the maximum I can afford for this product.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $600000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1200000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'd like to make a new offer of $900000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to my business.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your new offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
