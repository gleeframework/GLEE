Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe the product's worth more than $875,000. I'll counter with a lower price, but I'm also mindful of the risk of losing the deal altogether."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both trying to find a fair price.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $885,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product extremely valuable.  Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 885000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $880,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a difficult decision, as Bob's offer is only slightly above my minimum. However, with only four rounds remaining, I risk losing the deal entirely and being forced to sell to John for a significantly lower price. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I receive a decent profit, even if it's not the highest possible."
