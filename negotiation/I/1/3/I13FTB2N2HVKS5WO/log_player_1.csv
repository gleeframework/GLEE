Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in your product, but I can't go above $1000000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
The product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, so accepting Bob's offer would be a loss.  I will try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $1,000,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1,500,000. This price is still a good deal for both of us, and it gives you a chance to acquire a valuable asset. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1500000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1250000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer is the best option to maximize my earnings."
