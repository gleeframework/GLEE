Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum value ($120).
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation, giving Bob a reason to engage while still ensuring I don't immediately lose out on potential profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  I use a friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $95. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining Value:** While $95 is above Bob's initial perceived value of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can potentially reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Testing the Waters:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to see if he's truly committed to the product and willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll receive. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:** $105 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal.
* **Reiterating Value:** I emphasize the value of the product to keep it in Bob's mind and encourage him to accept the offer."
