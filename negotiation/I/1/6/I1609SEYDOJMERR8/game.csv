"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $90? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $90 is closer, but still a little high for my budget. How about $75? That's a fair deal for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm not willing to go as low as $75, but I can try to meet you halfway again. How about we try $85? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",85.0,Alice,5,
