"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if you're interested!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and your value for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, while also taking into account your budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs and allows us to close the deal. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering you the product for $1,075,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. If this is acceptable to you, we can finalize the deal. If not, I'm willing to consider other options.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
