"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price, especially since she values the product at $1,500,000 and you're still willing to pay more than her perceived value.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, while also taking into account your budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget. I can still try to negotiate further, especially since I know I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, especially since she's already made a concession. I'll make another counteroffer, but if it's rejected, I'll buy from John."

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering you the product for $1,075,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. While she has lowered the price significantly, I'm unwilling to risk further negotiations, especially since John is willing to sell me the product for my desired price.  I'll buy from John and save myself the time and potential frustration of further negotiation."
