{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** This allows you to potentially get more than $10,000 if Bob is willing to negotiate further. 
* **It's not too aggressive:**  This creates space for a back-and-forth negotiation without immediately shutting down the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget of $8000 for this product. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I will counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget of $8,000, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit further.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, I'm still aiming to keep the price at or below $8000. Would you be able to consider $8200 as a fair offer for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I will counteroffer again to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $8,200 is getting closer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,400? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 8400}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget constraints. However, I'm still not comfortable with $8400. Could you consider $8300 as a final offer for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, the offer of $8,300 is still too low. Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me a better return and avoids further negotiation that may not be fruitful."
