Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it's worth $20,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:** By offering the product at $20,000, you can gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts immediately, you've secured a great profit. If he negotiates, you can work towards a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, so there's limited risk in starting the negotiation higher with Bob.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always lower your asking price, but you can't raise it once offered."
