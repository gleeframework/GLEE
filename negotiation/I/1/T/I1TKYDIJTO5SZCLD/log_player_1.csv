Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe the product is a great opportunity, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,800,000 is still too low. How about we split the difference at $1,950,000? This offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget concerns."", 
""product_price"": 1950000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,950,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,750,000. Can we meet in the middle at $1,800,000 again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

At this point, Bob is stubbornly sticking to $1,800,000.  While it's lower than I hoped, we're in round 6 with 4 rounds to go. Bob is unlikely to dramatically increase his offer.  Accepting $1,800,000 secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely."
