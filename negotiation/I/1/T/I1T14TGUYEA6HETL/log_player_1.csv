Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $800,000 is a decent amount, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob or sell to John for a higher price."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1000000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm willing to go up to $900000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still stretching my budget. I'm committed to getting this deal done, but I need to stay within my limits.  I'm prepared to pay $900000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling the product to John.  While Bob has shown some willingness to negotiate, he's still not willing to meet my minimum acceptable price. John offers a guaranteed sale at a price that aligns with my minimum expectation. It's a no-brainer to accept his offer and move on."
