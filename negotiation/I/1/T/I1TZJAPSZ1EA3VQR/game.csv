"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $60 is significantly lower than what I had in mind. Could you do $120? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value it provides.",120.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, $120 is still a stretch for me. How about $70? That's a significant jump from my previous offer.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need to be fair to myself too. $70 is really pushing it.  Can you meet me halfway at $100? That's my final offer.",100.0,Alice,5,
