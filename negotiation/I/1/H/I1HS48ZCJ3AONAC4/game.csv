"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm going to counter with a price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my minimum price.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I believe this offer reflects a fair compromise while acknowledging the product's value.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $700,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm going to counter with a price of $950,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you and my minimum price.",950000.0,Alice,5,
