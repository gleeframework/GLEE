You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?

Alice's offer:

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $14,000, and waiting any longer risks missing out on John's guaranteed $8,000 offer. It's time to cut bait and secure the product at the best available price."
