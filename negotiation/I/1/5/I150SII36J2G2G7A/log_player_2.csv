Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's closer to my budget, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. I'm confident I can get a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, this time to $95. I'm trying to find a compromise that's acceptable to both of us. Since Alice has lowered her price, I believe she is getting closer to my range. I'm hoping this offer will be enough to convince her to close the deal."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, and we're running out of rounds.  It's become clear that Alice is not willing to negotiate down to a price that works for me. It's better to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $80. While I wanted to get the product for a lower price, at least I'm getting it within my budget and avoiding further negotiation."
