"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I propose a starting price of $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, Alice. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the initial price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is below my bottom line.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  I believe this price point reflects the true worth of this opportunity.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,400,000 is the best value for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the market value of the product. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to stay within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is close, but I need to be closer to $1,400,000 for this deal to make sense. Let's split the difference - $1,350,000 and we have a deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,325,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I'll get from the product. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to stay within my budget.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
