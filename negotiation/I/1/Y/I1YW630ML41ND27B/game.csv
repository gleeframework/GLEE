"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this unique product for a price that reflects its value. I'm proposing $1,150,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $900,000? This allows me to benefit while still providing you a good return.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too far below the product's true value.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows me to recoup a significant portion of the product's value while giving you a fair opportunity to acquire it.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That being said, $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $975,000?  I feel that this price strikes a fair balance between our positions.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. However, $975,000 is still significantly less than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's compromise once more. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a fair price that considers your budget while still allowing me to get a reasonable return on my investment.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're nearing a price we can both agree on.  To be frank, my absolute top end is $1,000,000. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'm ready to close the deal today.  Otherwise, I'll have to seriously consider my other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
