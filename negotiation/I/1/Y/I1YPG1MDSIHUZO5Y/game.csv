"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This price is fair considering the value to both of us. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit on your price.  $925,000 is still a bit too high for me right now.  Let's split the difference and I'll offer you $875,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering the value to both of us.  Let me know what you think.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $900,000.
