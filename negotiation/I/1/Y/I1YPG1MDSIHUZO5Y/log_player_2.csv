"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $900,000. While this is a discount from your maximum value of $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is a bit closer to my desired price, but I can still do better.  Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price. There's still room to bargain before I need to resort to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come back to her original offer of $900,000. While I'd prefer a lower price, it's important to remember that:

* This offer is still significantly less than my maximum value of $1,200,000.
*  Alice is unlikely to go lower, as she values the product at $800,000.
* If I reject this offer, it's likely we'll end up in a stalemate, and I'll have to buy from John at a much higher price.

Therefore, it's best to accept this offer and secure the product for a price that is favorable to me, but also keeps the negotiation moving forward."
