Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $130. I believe it's a great deal and would be valuable for you."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150 guaranteed, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Finding a Balance:**  Offering the product at $150 or more to Bob is likely to result in rejection. A price of $130 is a reasonable compromise â€“ it allows for a potential $30 profit over selling to John, while still offering Bob a price that's significantly lower than my minimum. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a guaranteed sale and potentially maximizing profit."
