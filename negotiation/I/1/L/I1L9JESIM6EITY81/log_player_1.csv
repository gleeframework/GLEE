Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find quite valuable. I believe it's worth $150 to you, and while I wouldn't sell it for anything less than $100, I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible. 
* **Negotiating Position:** Starting at $130 gives room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Backup Option:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $100 provides a safety net, ensuring you don't go below that price. 

By starting the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value, Alice increases her chances of securing a higher profit while still ensuring she gets a price above her minimum."
