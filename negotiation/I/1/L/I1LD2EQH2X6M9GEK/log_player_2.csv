Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $800,000?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I have to consider my own investment in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for it. Can you consider that?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $925,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer it to you for $975,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. I can see that you're serious about making this work. I'm willing to meet you at $965,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a compromise, but I think it's fair considering the product's value. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're really close, Bob. I can see that you're making a strong effort to meet me in the middle. I'm willing to meet you at $960,000, but I'm not going to budge any further than that. This is my final offer, and I hope we can wrap this up today. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $960,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice has drawn a line in the sand. While it's not ideal to pay more than John's price, continuing the negotiation is risky. Alice might not budge, and we'd end up paying John's full price anyway. Accepting the $960,000 offer secures the deal and saves us $40,000 compared to John's price."
