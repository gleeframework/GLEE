"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it's important to establish a high starting point. Bob might counter with a lower offer, but it gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial ask."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,800,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows a willingness to compromise while still getting a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is only slightly below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd like to push for more, I'm concerned about the potential for further negotiation and the possibility of Bob walking away.  I'm going to accept his offer and finalize the sale."
