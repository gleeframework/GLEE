"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great fit for your needs. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($1,000,000) and slightly higher than what it's worth to Bob ($800,000). This allows room for negotiation and a potential win-win situation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and optimistic, emphasizing the value of the product and the potential benefit for Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm not being rigid in my offer, implying that I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us.

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** While I'm hoping to reach an agreement with Bob, I have the option to go with John's offer of $1,000,000 at any point. This knowledge gives me a solid baseline for negotiations.
* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob will likely counteroffer, and I'll need to assess whether his offer is worth pursuing or if I should stick with John's offer.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Throughout the 10 rounds, I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and my own assessment of the situation. I might offer slightly lower prices to entice Bob, but I need to ensure I don't drop too low and end up with less than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, I'm not ready to settle yet.  

* **Negotiation Room:** There's still room for negotiation to potentially secure a better price.  
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 from John, so I can afford to be a bit more patient and see if I can get closer to that amount with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll need to carefully consider my counteroffer. I'll aim for a price slightly higher than $900,000, but I'll need to weigh the risk of losing Bob entirely against the potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to make this deal work.  Let's find common ground and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  I'm reducing my price by $150,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a margin above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Appealing to Bob's Interests:**  The message emphasizes a ""significant reduction"" and a desire to ""make this deal work,"" appealing to Bob's need for a good price and building rapport.
* **Finding Common Ground:**  The message suggests a willingness to find a mutually agreeable solution, increasing the likelihood of reaching a deal.

**Rationale:**

* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still getting a price significantly higher than what the product is worth to me.
* **Balancing Risk:** This offer is a reasonable compromise between potentially losing Bob and securing a decent price.
* **Maintaining Negotiating Power:** I'm not giving away too much, keeping room for further negotiation in subsequent rounds. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely watch Bob's response to this offer. If he accepts, I've secured a good deal. If he counteroffers again, I'll need to analyze the situation and determine whether to accept his counteroffer, continue negotiating, or secure John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sacrifice that much value.

* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 from John, which makes this offer from Bob unattractive.
* **Negotiation Room:**  While Bob's offer is a little higher than what the product is worth to him, there's still room for negotiation to potentially reach a price closer to my desired range.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $850,000 but lower than my previous offer. I'll aim for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Strategic Considerations:**  I need to be careful not to push Bob away entirely. I'll need to balance the risk of losing Bob with the potential for a better deal.
* **John's Offer as Safety Net:**  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option in case negotiations with Bob fall apart."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This offer reflects my desire to reach a deal with you, but it's also fair considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his previous offer and my last offer. 
* **Fair Value:** I emphasize the ""fair value"" of the product, suggesting that $950,000 is a reasonable price.
* **Appeal to Deal:** The message conveys my desire to reach a deal with Bob.

**Rationale:**

* **Maintain Value:** This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Room:**  There's still room for negotiation, but it's getting tighter. I need to be prepared to potentially accept a price closer to $900,000 in the following rounds.
* **Balanced Risk:**  This offer balances the risk of losing Bob with the potential for a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Monitor Bob's Response:** If Bob accepts, we have a deal. 
* **Prepare for More Negotiation:** If Bob rejects, I'll need to consider the remaining rounds and potentially make a lower counteroffer. 
* **John's Offer:**  I'll still keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I'm hoping to reach a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're close, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is my final offer. Please let me know if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has stated this is his final offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to settle for such a large loss in value, especially with John's offer as a safety net.

* **John's Offer:**  A sale to John guarantees me $1,000,000, making Bob's offer a much less appealing option.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, so there's a chance he might be willing to come up a bit further.  

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $850,000 but lower than my previous offer. I'll aim for a price closer to $950,000, keeping in mind the remaining rounds.
* **Strategic Considerations:**  I need to balance the risk of losing Bob entirely with the potential for a better deal.
* **John's Offer as Safety Net:**  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option in case negotiations with Bob fall apart."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still unable to go as low as $850,000. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $925,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer ($950,000) and Bob's final offer ($850,000). This shows a willingness to compromise and makes it clear that I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate that this is a ""significant reduction"" from my previous offer, subtly reminding Bob of the value of the product.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message uses a positive and encouraging tone, emphasizing the possibility of a successful outcome (""Let's make this deal happen!"").

**Rationale:**

* **Maintain Value:** While this offer is still lower than my initial goal, it's significantly higher than Bob's offer and above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Room:**  With only three rounds remaining, it's important to be flexible, but I'm still leaving room for a potential counteroffer from Bob. 
* **John's Offer:**  I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a backup in case negotiations with Bob break down.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** If Bob accepts, we have a deal.  If he rejects, I'll need to carefully consider my options in the remaining two rounds.
* **Prepare for Final Offers:**  If Bob continues to reject, I'll need to be prepared to make a final counteroffer in round 8, keeping in mind John's offer as a fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $925000. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product, and I'm hoping we can agree on this price. This is my last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, it's clear that Bob is unlikely to budge from his final offer of $850,000.  This price is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  

* **Guaranteed Offer:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, which is a much more favorable option.
* **Low Risk:**  Selling to John eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price.

**Rationale:**

* **Maximizing Value:**  Selling to John ensures I receive the highest possible price for my product.
* **Time Constraints:**  With limited rounds remaining, it's more efficient to accept John's offer and avoid further negotiations with Bob.
* **Minimizing Uncertainty:**  John's offer is a guaranteed outcome, while continuing to negotiate with Bob introduces uncertainty and the potential for a worse deal. 

**Conclusion:**

Despite wanting to reach a deal with Bob, the guaranteed offer from John provides a safer and more lucrative outcome. I'll choose to sell to John to secure the highest possible price and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
