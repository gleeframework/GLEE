# Alice's message: I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still too high.  Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, he should reject this offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially looking for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I think reflects the value of the product to you, while also being more in line with what I'm looking for.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price given the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John. While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or hold firm at this price.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
