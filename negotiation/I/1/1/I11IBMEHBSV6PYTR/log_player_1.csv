{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a decent starting point as it's halfway between my minimum acceptable price ($120) and Bob's estimated value ($80).  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still giving me a good chance to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I'd rather try to push for a slightly higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $90 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for the product. How about $95? It's still a good deal for you, and it helps me reach my goal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering $95, which is halfway between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $90. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still want to get a price that's closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer and I'm willing to meet in the middle. Would $92 work for both of us? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal! While I'd prefer to get closer to $100, $92 is above my minimum price of $120 and it seems like Bob is unlikely to go higher. It's better to accept this offer than to risk a further round of negotiation and potentially lose out on this sale entirely."
