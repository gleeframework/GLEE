"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think you'll love it! I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,500. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12,750. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",12750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.  To be honest,  $12,000 is the highest I'm comfortable going.  If you're able to do that, I'm ready to close the deal.",12000.0,Bob,6,
