"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point as it's a significant discount for Bob from the $150 value he places on the product, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate while ensuring a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $110. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still keeping the price above Bob's offer. It also gives us a good chance to reach a mutually agreeable price."
