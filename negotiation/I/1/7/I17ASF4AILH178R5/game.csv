"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to own this product,  $2000000 is a bit too high for me. Considering my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer you $1500000. I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1500000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to let the product go for that price. Considering its value and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1750000. I think this is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the value you place on the product.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
