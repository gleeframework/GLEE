"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm really interested in the product but would be happy to buy it for $80. Let me know what you think!",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, appreciate your interest!  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us. How about $130? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $130 is still a little high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this, but I can't go higher than $100. Let's see if we can find a middle ground!",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $100 is still a bit low for me, but to show you I'm serious about making this work, I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a good price considering the value you'll get out of this product. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $120 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. How about $110? I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm really eager to get this product!",110.0,Bob,6,
