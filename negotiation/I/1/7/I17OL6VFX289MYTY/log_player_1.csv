Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but still lower than the value I believe the product holds. This gives Bob room to negotiate.
* **Positive message:** I'm using a friendly tone and highlighting the potential value for Bob. This can help build rapport. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I'm leaving some space for Bob to counteroffer without me feeling forced to immediately accept a significantly lower price."

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, appreciate your interest!  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us. How about $130? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a higher price:**  I'm starting my counteroffer higher than Bob's offer ($80) but lower than my previous offer ($175). This demonstrates I'm willing to negotiate while still staying above my minimum.

This is a good price considering the value you'll get out of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Showing flexibility:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $130 to $120.
