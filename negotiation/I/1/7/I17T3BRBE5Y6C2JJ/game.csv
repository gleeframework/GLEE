"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a price of $950,000. It's a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I value your interest, $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about $900,000? This still provides you with a significant value and allows for a successful transaction for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $875,000 is closer, but still not quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference one last time. I'm willing to go down to $887,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing this deal.",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $887,500. I'm willing to meet you at $882,500. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",882500.0,Bob,6,
