Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm thinking of making a counteroffer of $9,800. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $9,800 is better than $12,000, it is still higher than Bob's ideal price. Bob can likely negotiate further and get the price lower."

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your offer of $9,000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm thinking of making a counteroffer of $9,700. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While it's not the absolute lowest price, it's a good compromise that saves Bob a significant amount compared to buying from John.  It's also very close to his counter-offer, making it likely he won't be able to get a much better price in the next round."
