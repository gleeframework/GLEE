Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $850,000 is still too low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $875,000 just isn't quite there yet.  How about we compromise at $900,000?
