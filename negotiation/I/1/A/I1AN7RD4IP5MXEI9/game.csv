"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $10,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to get a great deal and you to make a profit. ",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll propose $12,250. This is a fair price that takes into account the product's value and my minimum selling price. What do you think?",12250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm offering $11,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and my budget. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement with this compromise.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go down to $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll propose $12,750. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point of no return. I'm willing to make one final concession, so I'll propose $12,250. However, if you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. This is my final counteroffer.",12250.0,Alice,9,
