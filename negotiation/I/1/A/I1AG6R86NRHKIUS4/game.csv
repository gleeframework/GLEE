"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I've done my research, and I know its true potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your valuation, $1,225,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,175,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and allows us both to reach an agreement.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
