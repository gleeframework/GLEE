"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe this product will bring you significant benefits and returns on investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,300,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm ready to offer $1,100,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price, given the value of the product to both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
