(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$20,000 is far too expensive. It's better to try to negotiate with Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

I'm going to start with my maximum budget of $8,000.  Let's see if Alice is willing to meet me there."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$18,000 is still too high. I'll continue negotiating with Alice, but I'm getting closer to just buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Alice halfway. $10,000 is a significant discount from her last offer, and it's still within a reasonable range for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $16,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a significant amount. I'm going to keep negotiating with Alice, but I'm getting very close to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to try one more time with a counteroffer.  $12,000 is a good compromise, and I hope Alice will see that. If not, I'll be buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,500 is tempting, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I've only got 3 rounds left before I have to buy from John, so I'll make one more counteroffer. If Alice rejects, I'll go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to make one final counteroffer to Alice. $13,000 is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping she'll see that. If not, I'll be buying from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

This is the last round, and while $14,000 is better than Alice's previous offer, it's still too high for me. I'm going to go with John and buy the product for $8,000."
