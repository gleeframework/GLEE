{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it very useful. I'm asking for $100, which is a fair price considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts by building rapport with Bob and highlighting the potential benefit to him. It sets a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $90 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still hopeful to get closer to my ideal $100. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $90 is still a little too low for me. How about $95? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still looking to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps meet at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to make a profit closer to my ideal $100, Bob is firm on $90.  It's not worth risking a longer negotiation and potentially losing more time. John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price of $120, so I'll go with that option."
