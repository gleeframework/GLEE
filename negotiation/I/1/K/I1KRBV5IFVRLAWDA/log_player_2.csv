"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You can get the product from John for $100, so you shouldn't accept anything higher than that. 
* It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You have 10 rounds to work with, so you have time to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* This is a reasonable counteroffer, as it's in the middle of Alice's offer ($85) and your maximum price ($100).
* It shows Alice you're serious about buying the product but are also looking for a good deal. 
*  You have several rounds left to negotiate, so there's room to adjust the price further if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is now at your maximum price ($100).
* You can get the product from John for the same price.
* There's no need to risk further negotiation, as you're already at your desired price."
