"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, I'm not able to meet your price point. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which still represents a good profit for you. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and it's closer to my original asking price. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $9,000. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
