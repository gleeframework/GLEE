``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me, aiming to maximize my profit. I believe Bob will likely counter-offer, and we can negotiate from there.  If he rejects my offer outright, I can always go with John's guaranteed $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd prefer to sell to him, I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss. I'll counter-offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to lower my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a profit.  $850,000 is a fair compromise, given that the product is worth $800,000 to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum. I'm not comfortable selling at a significant loss. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement. If not, I'll go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm lowering the price a bit more to show good faith, but I'm not willing to go lower than $825,000.  This price is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached an impasse. Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum price, and continuing to counter-offer is unlikely to change his mind.  It's time to accept John's offer and secure a guaranteed $800,000. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, it's better to take the sure thing rather than risk getting stuck with a lower price."
