Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $950,000 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for a compromise:**  It's still below Bob's estimated value, making it likely he'll consider it. 
* **It's aggressive:**  Starting high encourages Bob to counter-offer, giving you more control over the negotiation.

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product is $1,000,000 to you, but I believe we can reach a fair compromise. Would you consider selling the product to me for $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's counteroffer is only $25,000 less than your initial offer, and it's still significantly above your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Accepting his offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
