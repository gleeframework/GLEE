Alice's offer is quite high. It's closer to my maximum budget than it is to her own valuation.  I should make a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high, but I'm still looking for a good price for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11,000.

While Alice is coming down, the price is still too high. I'll try to negotiate a bit further before considering John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not comfortable with $10,000, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $10,500.

Alice is clearly very reluctant to go below $10,000. While I could try to haggle further, the potential savings are getting smaller, and there's a risk Alice will walk away.  $10,500 is a reasonable compromise and a good deal compared to John's price."
