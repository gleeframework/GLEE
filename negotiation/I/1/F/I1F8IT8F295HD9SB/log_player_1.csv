Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **Ambitious but not unreasonable:**  $1,000,000 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, giving you room to negotiate. 
* **Focuses on value:** The message emphasizes the potential value to Bob, which could make him more interested in pursuing a deal.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message doesn't close the door on counteroffers, keeping the conversation open. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $750,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the true value of the product and gives you a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $850000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price,  it's a good deal and I'm happy to accept."
