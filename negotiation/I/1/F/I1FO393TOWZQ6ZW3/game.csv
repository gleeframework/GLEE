"I understand that you're looking to keep expenses within a certain budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $13000. I'm willing to meet you at $13500, which is the next best price I can offer. This is the last time I'll be willing to negotiate, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,5,
