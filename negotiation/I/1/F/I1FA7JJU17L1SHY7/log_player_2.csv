"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you're aiming to save money, it's always advantageous to try and negotiate a lower price. Rejecting Alice's initial offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get the product for less than $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $75? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest!  $75 is a little lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $85?  It's still a great deal for a product like this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $100 to $85. This is a significant discount and puts the price within your budget.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice could reject your counteroffer and you'd be forced to buy from John at $100. Accepting the offer now guarantees you get the product for a good price."
