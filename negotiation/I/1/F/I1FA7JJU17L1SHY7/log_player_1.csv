Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to leave room for negotiation.  
* **Positive Tone:** I use a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message makes it clear that I'm open to discussing the price further. 
 
This approach aims to maximize my potential profit while keeping the negotiation open and friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $75? Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $80.  I'm not willing to sell for less than that.  I'll try to get closer to my desired price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest!  $75 is a little lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $85?  It's still a great deal for a product like this."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while proposing a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Highlight Value:**  I emphasize the quality of the product to justify the price point.
* **Positive Tone:**  I remain friendly and encouraging to keep the negotiation moving forward.

This approach aims to find a compromise while ensuring I don't go below my minimum price."
