"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I see in the product. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,150,000, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This is a good price that reflects the value I see in it, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll offer you the product for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
