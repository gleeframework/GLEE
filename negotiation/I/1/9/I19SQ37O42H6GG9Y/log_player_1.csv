"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. It also sets the stage for a potentially lucrative deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  There are still 8 rounds left and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $17,000. This is a significant increase from his offer, but still lower than my initial asking price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but I'm also not giving away the product for a pittance. Hopefully, this will lead to a middle ground we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with that price. I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for something closer to my target. There are still 6 rounds left, and I'm not ready to settle for a low price just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $16,000.  This is a compromise between his last offer and my previous counteroffer. I'm hoping this signals that I'm serious about closing a deal, but still holding firm on my value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's becoming clear that Bob is not willing to meet my price expectations. With only 4 rounds left, I'm concerned that we won't be able to reach an agreement. Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees I get a fair price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially resulting in a lower price."
