"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal considering the value it holds! Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a good price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105. This still gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $105 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $95, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's try to make this work.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $95 is still a bit low for me, but I want to make this work.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make a decent profit while still giving you a good deal. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
