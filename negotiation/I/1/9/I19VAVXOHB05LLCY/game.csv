"I'm excited to offer you this great product! It's a fantastic deal for you, and I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it for $180?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a limited budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for considering my budget, Alice.  I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about $75?  That's a fair price and would allow me to purchase it today.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above your $75 offer. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $100?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $100 is a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $80? That's my final offer.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $80 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. Let's try $110. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",110.0,Alice,7,
