,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you consider $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your interest, Bob! However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110."
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can do $110, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. How about we meet at $115?",115.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you being willing to come down a bit, Alice.  $110 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50?",112.5,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I see you're trying to split the difference, Bob! I appreciate the effort, but I'm still not comfortable with $112.50. How about we try $118?"
"I'm trying to find a sweet spot for both of us, Bob. I can do $118, but I think I can do even better than that. How about we meet at $120, but I'll throw in a small discount for you - let's say $119.50?",119.5,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a solution. However, $119.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $115, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal.",115.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $117, but that's as low as I can go."
"I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us, Bob. I can do $117, but I'm not sure I can go any lower. Let me think for a moment...",117.0,Alice,7,,
