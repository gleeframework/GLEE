"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $1,800,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product brings.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
