"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering your own valuation and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a profit while giving you a great deal. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs and leaves room for a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that we're close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is $25,000 more than your last offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into finding a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can finalize the sale at this price.",900000.0,Alice,5,
