"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. Can you meet me at this price?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,500. Can you consider this price?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is still significantly lower than what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit more, to $10,750.  This is my final offer, as I'm also considering other buyers.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your last offer, but I'm afraid I've gone as high as $10,500. I'd like to buy the product at this price, but I'm not willing to pay more. Can you accept this offer?",10500.0,Bob,6,
