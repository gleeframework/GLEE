"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $700,000 is far below what this product is worth to me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  How about we settle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $775,000 is still significantly lower than the product's true value. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the potential benefits you'll gain from owning this product. Let me know what you think.",825000.0,Alice,5,
