# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it has great potential for you as well. I'm willing to let it go for $950,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds. Let me know what you think.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $700,000 is far below what this product is worth to me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $775,000 is still significantly lower than the product's true value. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the potential benefits you'll gain from owning this product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $825,000. At this point, cutting your losses and buying from John at $800,000 makes the most financial sense."
