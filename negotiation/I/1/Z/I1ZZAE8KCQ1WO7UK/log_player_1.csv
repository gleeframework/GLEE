"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I need to keep negotiating to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm dropping the price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still too low. I'm hoping I can push him a bit higher.  I have 6 rounds left and I'm confident I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm dropping the price again, but I'm still aiming for a price that is better than what Bob offered last round. I want to see if I can find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is getting closer, I'm still not satisfied.  I have 4 rounds left and I believe I can get a better deal. I'm willing to take the risk of further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm dropping the price just a little bit more, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to meet me halfway."
