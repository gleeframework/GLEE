"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1400000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's room for negotiation. You know the product is worth less to Alice ($1,200,000), so you can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,300,000. This price is still fair, considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1300000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm confident it will bring you a good return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1350000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is a good deal for you.  It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000, and you're still getting the product for a price less than your initial maximum of $1,500,000.  There's a chance you could negotiate further, but the risk of Alice walking away or you having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential gains from further negotiation."
