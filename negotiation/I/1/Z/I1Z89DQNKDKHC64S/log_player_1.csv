Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:** This price is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000), but lower than my minimum acceptable value ($15,000). This makes it a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob.  It avoids putting pressure on him, making him more likely to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Start the negotiation strong:**  Offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value shows I'm serious about selling to him.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** A $1,000 gap gives us both some wiggle room to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $12,000 for it. Would you consider accepting this lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is my absolute minimum, I'm not in a rush to sell. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to negotiate a higher price. 

* **Reasoning:** Bob's initial offer is lower than my desired price. There's a chance I can push him higher with a counteroffer. 
* **Risk:**  If I keep rejecting offers, I risk losing Bob as a buyer and having to sell to John at my minimum price.  However, the potential for a higher price outweighs this risk in this instance."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. How about $13,000? That's a fair compromise, and I believe it still represents a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is $1,000 higher than Bob's initial offer, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate but still holding firm on a price closer to my desired value.
* **Message:** The message is polite and avoids sounding aggressive.  It emphasizes the value for Bob and positions the offer as a ""fair compromise,"" making it more likely for Bob to accept.

**Strategy:** This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain leverage:** By not immediately accepting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell and have some negotiating power.
* **Explore potential compromise:**  $13,000 allows for a middle ground that could be acceptable to both parties.
* **Minimize risk:**  While still below my desired price, $13,000 is significantly closer to my minimum than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I understand your position, I am still unable to meet at $13,000. I am willing to go up to $12,500. This brings us closer to my maximum budget while still providing a fair value for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is only $500 away from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's unlikely I can get a significantly higher offer from Bob, and continuing to negotiate risks losing him altogether. 

* **Reasoning:** At this point, the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of losing the deal.
* **Risk:**  While $12,500 is not ideal, it's a much better outcome than selling to John at my minimum price or risking Bob walking away completely. 

Accepting Bob's offer is the most practical decision, ensuring a sale while minimizing the potential for a worse outcome."
