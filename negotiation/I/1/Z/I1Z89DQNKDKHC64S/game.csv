"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $12,000 for it. Would you consider accepting this lower price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. How about $13,000? That's a fair compromise, and I believe it still represents a great value for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I understand your position, I am still unable to meet at $13,000. I am willing to go up to $12,500. This brings us closer to my maximum budget while still providing a fair value for your product.",12500.0,Bob,4,
