Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Minimum Value:**  You know the product is worth at least $10,000 to you. 
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed $10,000 from John, so anything above that is profit. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Offering $15,000 gives you a good chance of earning more, but risks losing the sale to John. 

By offering $15,000, you're balancing the risk of losing the sale with the potential for a larger profit."
