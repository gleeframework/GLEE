"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, however. How about $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is my final offer, as I have other options available.",10000.0,Bob,4,
