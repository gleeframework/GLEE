"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, aiming to leave room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit.  I'll observe Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum, it's still lower than what I initially offered. I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I believe I can get a better deal if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counter with $140. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer.  I want to show flexibility while also trying to close the gap.  I believe this is a fair price that could be acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $120. Accepting this offer is the best course of action to secure a reasonable profit."
