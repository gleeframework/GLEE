"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $110? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $95. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $105? It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll really love the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
