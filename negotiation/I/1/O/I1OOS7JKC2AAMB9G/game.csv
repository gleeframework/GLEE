"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, Alice. However, I'm not willing to pay $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering its worth to me. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you have budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm still confident the product will deliver immense value for you.  I'm open to further discussion, but I can't go any lower.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering its worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,250,000 is still below my bottom line. I'm willing to meet you at $1,275,000, which is a good compromise for both of us. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that $1,275,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $1,225,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to stay within my budget.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
