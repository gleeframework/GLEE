Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) and significantly lower than John's guaranteed offer ($150). This leaves room for bargaining if needed.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** Offering a price of $130 makes it seem like Alice is giving Bob a good deal while still ensuring a significant profit margin for herself. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  If Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice can slightly lower the price to entice him without going below her minimum acceptable price."
