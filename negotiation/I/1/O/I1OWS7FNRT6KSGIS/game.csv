"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price more around $80. Would you be willing to consider a lower price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $90?  That way we both get a good deal.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $90. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $85 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $90, which would be $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",85.0,Bob,6,
