{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer starts the negotiation by offering the product at a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him some room to negotiate while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price more around $80. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price point in the next round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $90?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $90. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $85 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $90, which would be $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This round has been a stalemate. Bob is unwilling to budge significantly from his price point, and I'm not willing to go lower than $95.  While I could continue to counteroffer, it's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach an agreement. 

To avoid further time wasted and ensure I get the best possible price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. This guarantees me a higher profit than what Bob is currently offering."
