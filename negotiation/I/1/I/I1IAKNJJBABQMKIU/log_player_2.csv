"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $95 is higher than Bob's maximum price of $80.
*  There are still 9 rounds left, so Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price, which is $80.
* This is the price he can get from John if he chooses to stop negotiating with Alice.
* By offering $80, Bob is setting a clear boundary and showing Alice that he's serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $90 is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $80. 
* There are still 7 rounds left, so Bob can continue to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  
* There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further, especially as she has already rejected Bob's counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob has already tried offering the minimum price of $80, which Alice rejected.
*  It's unlikely Alice will accept $80, but she might be willing to meet in the middle at $85. 
* This offer is still lower than Alice's previous offer of $90, showing Bob is serious about negotiating. 
* With 6 rounds remaining, Bob can still try to get a better deal if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $88 is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $80.
* There are 5 rounds left, and Bob is still determined to save as much money as possible.
* Even though Alice has come down in price, there's still a chance she might be willing to go lower, especially since she has rejected Bob's previous counteroffer. 
* By rejecting this offer, Bob keeps the negotiation going and increases the pressure on Alice to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 82}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob has already tried offering $80 and $85, which Alice rejected.
* Alice's last offer of $88 is close to Bob's target of $80. 
* By offering $82, Bob is showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a better price than Alice's last offer.
* With 4 rounds remaining, there's still time to negotiate a better deal if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $86
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $86 is only $6 more than Bob's maximum price of $80.
* There are only 3 rounds left, and it's unlikely Alice will come down to $80. 
* It's more beneficial for Bob to accept this offer rather than risk further negotiation and potentially end up buying from John at $80 anyway. 
* Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that's close to his target and ensures he doesn't lose more time with further negotiation."
