"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the fact that I could buy it from someone else for $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the fact that I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair compromise considering we're both willing to meet in the middle. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,
