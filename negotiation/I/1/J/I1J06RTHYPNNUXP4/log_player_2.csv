This offer is tailored to ensure you receive a great deal while also allowing me to maximize the value of the product. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $150 for the product. Alice is offering it for $140, which is better than John's price of $150. However, you can still try to get a better deal. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her or find another seller offering a better price."
