You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  There's no reason to accept an offer that is $500,000 over your maximum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your serious intent to buy the product while staying within your budget. It also leaves room for further negotiation. Starting with a large jump in price allows for more bargaining power in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget, although it's closer. There's still room for negotiation. I'm going to try to push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down by $200,000 from her initial offer, so I'm increasing my counteroffer by the same amount. This demonstrates that I'm willing to meet her halfway, but I'm still firm on staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum. I'm going to continue negotiating.  I still have some room to bargain, and I'd prefer to get the product for less than $1,700,000 if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now come down to $1,700,000, and I'm confident I can get her to accept my maximum price. John is also offering the product at this price, so I'm not losing out if she rejects my offer.  It's time to go all-in and see if she'll meet me at my budget."
