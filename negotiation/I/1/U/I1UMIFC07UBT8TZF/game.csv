"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.  This is still a good deal for you as you value it at $8,000, and it's a significant savings for me.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your position, I would like to respectfully decline it. I believe the value of this product justifies a higher price. I am willing to negotiate further, so let's aim for a compromise. How about we consider $11,000 for the product?",11000.0,Alice,3,
