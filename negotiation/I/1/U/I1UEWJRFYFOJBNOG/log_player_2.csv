"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John at $15,000. There's a chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice or try your luck with another seller altogether."
