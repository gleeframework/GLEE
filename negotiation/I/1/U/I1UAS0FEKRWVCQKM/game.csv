"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, I believe $900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to offer $650,000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, I still feel $825,000 is a bit high. How about $725,000? This offer represents a significant investment on my part but also acknowledges the value of the product.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but $725,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
