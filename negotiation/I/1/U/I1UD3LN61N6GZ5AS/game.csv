"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's a great deal and I think you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $65. What do you think?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $65 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  $85 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $70. How about we meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $75 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $80? This is my final offer.",80.0,Alice,5,
