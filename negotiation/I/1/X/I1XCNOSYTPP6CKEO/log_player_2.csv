"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is excellent, the price is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($700,000) to establish a negotiation range. This leaves room for me to gradually increase my offer if needed.
* **Polite and Respectful:**  Maintaining a positive tone is important in negotiations. I acknowledge Alice's offer and express my interest while explaining my price point. 
* **Strategic Goal:** My ultimate goal is to buy for significantly less than John's $800,000 offer. By starting low, I'm aiming to secure a deal that's a steal compared to my alternative option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell it to you for $820,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the negotiations so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above John's Price:** Alice's counteroffer of $820,000 is still more expensive than buying from John. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Alice compromised, we're still in early rounds. There's a chance to negotiate a price closer to or below $800,000.
* **Leverage of John's Offer:** I have the security of John's offer, which gives me leverage to push for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $760,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 760000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm suggesting a price exactly halfway between my previous offer ($700,000) and her counteroffer ($820,000). This strategy often feels fair to both parties.
* **Closing the Gap:** While I'm inching closer to John's price, I'm still leaving myself some room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Clear and Concise:** My message is straightforward and focuses on finding a mutually beneficial solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $760,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can sell it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Equal Price:** Alice's offer now matches John's price of $800,000.
* **No Guarantee of a Better Deal:**  Alice has stated this is her lowest price.  Continuing the negotiation might not result in a lower price from Alice and could waste valuable time.
* **Time Saved:** Opting for John's offer immediately secures the product at the desired price point without further negotiation rounds."
