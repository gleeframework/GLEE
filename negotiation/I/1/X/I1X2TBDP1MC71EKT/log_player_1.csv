Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is above Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and positive. I highlight the ""great deal"" aspect to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Strategy:**  This is a starting point to gauge Bob's interest. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy, considering his counteroffer and my willingness to potentially sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only able to pay $950,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below what I want to earn. 
* **Selling to John:**  I'm aware that selling to John guarantees me $1,200,000, but I'm still open to the possibility of getting a better price from Bob. 
* **Negotiation:** I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating with him. I believe there's room for improvement, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll need to carefully consider my counteroffer to Bob. I'll need to find a price that's attractive enough to him while still maximizing my own profit. I'll also need to factor in the risk of losing Bob as a buyer if I push too hard."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good value for the product. Let's find common ground and make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm raising my price slightly from Bob's offer to $975,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it still leaves some room for potential profit.
* **Message:**  I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone. I acknowledge Bob's perspective but emphasize the ""fair price"" and ""good value"" aspects of my counteroffer. 
* **Strategy:**  This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between our positions. It demonstrates flexibility while still protecting my financial interests. I'm hoping this move will encourage Bob to accept or make a counteroffer closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering your latest offer, I would like to counter with an offer of $960,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. Thank you for your understanding. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $960,000 is still below my initial target, it's only $15,000 away from my previous counteroffer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Considering the potential of further negotiation and the possibility of Bob rejecting my next counteroffer, I'm choosing to accept his offer. There's a risk that I could push for a higher price and end up with nothing. 
* **Time Factor:**  The longer the negotiation drags on, the more likely I am to lose Bob as a buyer or lose interest in the deal myself.  Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal and secure a substantial profit. 

**Conclusion:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm choosing to prioritize the certainty of a $960,000 sale over the potential of a higher price that might not materialize."
