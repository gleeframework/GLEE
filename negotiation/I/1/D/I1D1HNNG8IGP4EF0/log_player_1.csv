Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be a great fit for you.  I'm offering it to you for $13,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob ($13,000) gives me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Leaving Room:**  This also allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob without making me feel like I'm giving away too much. 
* **John as a Backup:**  The presence of John as a backup buyer at $12,000 ensures I have a guaranteed minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product you're selling, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000? I believe that would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob's Price:**  Bob's offer of $12,000 is exactly the minimum I'm willing to accept. 
* **No Room for Improvement:**  There's no need to risk a counteroffer and potentially lose the sale, especially when John offers the same price.
* **Time and Effort:**  Accepting Bob's offer saves me the time and effort of further negotiation."
