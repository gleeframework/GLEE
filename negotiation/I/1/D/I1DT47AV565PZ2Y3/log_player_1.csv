Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to the middle point between my minimum value ($100) and Bob's maximum value ($150). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation without risking a quick rejection. 
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly message can help build rapport and make Bob more open to negotiation.

**Strategy:** 
I'm aiming to secure a deal that's closer to Bob's value while still making a decent profit. I'm also aware of John's offer, providing a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $110 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for higher price:** I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer to try and secure a price closer to my desired range. I'm confident I can counter with a price that will be acceptable to Bob.  While John offers a safe option, I'm not ready to settle for a lower price just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  However, $110 is a bit too low for me. Would you consider $120? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer ($130) and his last offer ($110).
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth $150 to him, so $120 is still a great deal.
* **Maintain Firmness:** I'm still holding firm on my minimum price, but showing a willingness to negotiate. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to get as close as possible to my desired price while remaining open to a deal. I believe this counteroffer is fair and likely to be accepted by Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $120. How about we meet at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $115 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Risk of Lower Offer:**  If I reject Bob's offer and counter again, there's a risk he will either reject my counteroffer or lower his offer even further.
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing the negotiation could take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee of a better outcome.

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice.  It ensures a sale at a price that's just above my minimum, and avoids the potential for a lower offer or a prolonged negotiation."
