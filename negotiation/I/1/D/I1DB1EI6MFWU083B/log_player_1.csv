{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's the best price I can offer right now. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me some room to negotiate while still getting a good deal.
* **Message:** I'm friendly and encouraging, highlighting the benefits for Bob. I also mention it's the best price I can offer right now to imply potential scarcity and urgency.

This offer aims to:

* **Start the negotiation:**  Get Bob to seriously consider the offer.
* **Test the waters:** See if Bob is willing to pay more than his initial valuation.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  If Bob counteroffers, I can adjust based on his response.

I'm also ready to accept John's offer if negotiations with Bob fail. This provides a safety net and ensures I don't compromise my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value. 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because:

* **My minimum:** $9,000 is too low for me. 
* **Negotiation:** I want to see if Bob is willing to increase his offer.
* **Potential:** I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.

This rejection allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round, potentially bringing Bob closer to my target price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not able to go that low.  I can come down to $10,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering with $10,500. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still maintaining a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:**  I'm friendly and reiterate the value of the product. I also acknowledge Bob's previous offer, showing I'm taking his perspective into account.
* **Next Steps:** This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate further.  If he's serious about the product, I believe he might be willing to come up a bit. 
* **Preparedness:**  I'm ready to accept John's offer if Bob rejects my counteroffer. This ensures I don't end up with a price that's too low for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I would prefer to earn more,  Bob's counteroffer of $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's becoming clear that Bob is unwilling to meet me closer to my desired price. 

I'm choosing to sell to John for the following reasons:

* **Time is valuable:** Continuing negotiations with Bob could take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee of a favorable outcome.
* **Guaranteed profit:** John's offer guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and a significant profit.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Further negotiations with Bob could lead to a lower price, while John's offer provides a sure thing.

This decision ensures that I secure a good price for my product without further risk or delay."
