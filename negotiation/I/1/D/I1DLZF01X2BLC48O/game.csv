"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,250. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, but also shows that I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",8250.0,Alice,3,
