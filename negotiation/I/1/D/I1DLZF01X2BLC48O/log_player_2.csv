"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $9,000 is better than John's $12,000, there is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me."", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,250. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, but also shows that I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250

* It's a good compromise, as Alice is willing to meet Bob halfway.
* Accepting this offer allows Bob to buy the product for a price that's significantly lower than John's."
