"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,500,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the fact that I'm willing to buy it now.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is truly significant, and $1,100,000 falls short of what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value.  Let's close the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
