"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's in great condition and worth a lot to you, so I think this is a fair price.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, Bob has 9 more rounds to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value of the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $9,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our ongoing negotiation, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original price.  I'm willing to go down to $9,500.  This is a good compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price than $9,500. He has 7 rounds left and can continue to try and negotiate.  He's already gotten Alice down from $10,000 to $9,500, so there's a good chance she'll continue to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get closer to your original price, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $9,250? This is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired price."", ""product_price"": 9250}
