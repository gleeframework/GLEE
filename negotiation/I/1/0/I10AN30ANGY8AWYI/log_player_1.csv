Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
