"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $16,000. This leaves room for both of us to walk away happy. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer. I'm willing to go down to $15,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget.  Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer, but I'm still a bit above $15,500. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",14500.0,Bob,6,
