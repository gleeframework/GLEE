"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth discussing a price that suits both of us. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to the value you placed on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,200,000 is a bit too high, but I can go as low as $1,150,000. This price still reflects the value I believe the product holds, but it's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay at this time. To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  This price is fair and allows us to reach an agreement.  Let's make this happen!",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,150,000, so I'm offering $1,125,000. This price is a fair compromise that I think we can both agree on.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
