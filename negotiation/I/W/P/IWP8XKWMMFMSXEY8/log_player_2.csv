"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $850,000 is better than $1,000,000, Bob should try to negotiate a lower price. He can reject the offer and make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his maximum price ($1,000,000) and Alice's value ($800,000). Offering $825,000 gives Alice some profit while still saving Bob a significant amount. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $840,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $840,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $840,000 is a reasonable compromise.  It's closer to Bob's maximum price of $1,000,000, and allows for a significant saving compared to buying from John. While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the next offer and ending up with a higher price from John makes accepting the current offer the best option."
