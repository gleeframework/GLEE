"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value, I believe it's worth $100 for you. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $100 is less than the $120 from John, it's still more than the product's value to Bob ($120).  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product,  $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price closer to his value for the product ($80). This shows he's serious about buying but also wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to propose a price of $90 for the product. This is higher than my initial offer but still lower than what I was expecting. I hope this aligns better with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  There's room for further negotiation, and Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  He should continue to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $90 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference - I'll pay $87.50.  This seems fair, as it's right in the middle of our offers."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Bob is proposing a middle ground, demonstrating his willingness to meet Alice halfway.
* **Clear Value:**  The $87.50 price is closer to Bob's desired price and still allows Alice to make a profit. 
* **Positivity:** Bob's message maintains a positive tone, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation."
