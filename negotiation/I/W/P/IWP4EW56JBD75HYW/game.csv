"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product,  $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to propose a price of $90 for the product. This is higher than my initial offer but still lower than what I was expecting. I hope this aligns better with your budget.",90.0,Alice,3,
