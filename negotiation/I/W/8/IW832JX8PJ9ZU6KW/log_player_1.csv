Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
