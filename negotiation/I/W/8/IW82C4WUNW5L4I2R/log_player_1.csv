{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This initial offer is a starting point.  It's above my minimum price of $10,000, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see value in the product and be willing to pay a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to find a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,000? This would still give you a great deal on a very valuable product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, so I'm willing to pay $10500. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is above my minimum threshold of $10,000 and a decent compromise. While I'd prefer my initial asking price,  I'm satisfied with this outcome and it's better than selling to John for $10,000."
