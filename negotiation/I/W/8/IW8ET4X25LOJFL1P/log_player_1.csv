"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still securing a good profit. I'm also being friendly and open to discussion to build a rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. However, $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is below my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that price yet. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price. There are still more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand that $100 is your budget, but unfortunately, that's too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $135. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 
 
I'm lowering the price a bit to $135, which is still above my minimum but shows willingness to compromise. I'm also reiterating the value of the product to justify my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $135 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $117.50? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $117.5 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  There are still rounds left and I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $117.50 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $126.25? This would allow us both to come to an agreement and move forward."", ""product_price"": 126.25}
```

I'm proposing a price right in the middle of our last two offers. This shows a commitment to reaching a compromise while still staying above my minimum price.  I'm also reiterating my desire to move forward with the deal."
