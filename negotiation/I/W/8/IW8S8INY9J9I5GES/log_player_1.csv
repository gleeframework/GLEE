Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives him room to negotiate, making him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By offering $12,000, I allow for some back-and-forth negotiation without jeopardizing my minimum profit.
* **Avoiding ""John"" Immediately:**  While I know I can sell to John for $15,000, I want to see if I can get closer to that with Bob first. 
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is too low, it shows he's willing to negotiate.  I can likely get a better price by counter-offering.
* **Selling to John is a Guarantee:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, I have the potential to earn more by continuing the negotiation with Bob.  

**Next Steps:**  I will counter-offer Bob with a price closer to my target, aiming to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to counteroffer. While I value your interest, $9,000 is a bit too far below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm happy to offer the product for $10,500. This reflects the value of the product while also acknowledging your budget concerns. Let me know if this works for you!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price that's above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to encourage Bob to reconsider his initial offer.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone helps keep the negotiation positive and encourages Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

By counter-offering at $10,500, I've shown flexibility.  I'm hoping this will lead to a successful negotiation and a sale closer to my target price. If Bob rejects again, I'll need to assess whether his counteroffer is worth considering or if it's time to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to compromise. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your effort to meet my budget constraints. However, I would still like to explore other options. I am proposing a final counteroffer of $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm not likely to get significantly more through further negotiation.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could result in Bob walking away or making a counteroffer that's even lower. This would risk losing the sale altogether.
* **Time is Money:**  Selling to Bob now guarantees a sale and avoids the time and effort of further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure the sale and maximize my potential earnings. While I'm getting slightly less than I'd hoped for, it's a reasonable compromise that ensures a sale without further risk."
