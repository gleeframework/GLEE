Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think it would be a great deal for you!"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it for $150, Bob is unlikely to accept since it's worth less to him.  You want to get as close to $150 as possible while still making the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $135 offers a potential profit for you while still being a price that Bob might find acceptable, considering it's only slightly more than his perceived value.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John if Bob declines, so there's little risk in starting with a slightly higher offer to Bob."
