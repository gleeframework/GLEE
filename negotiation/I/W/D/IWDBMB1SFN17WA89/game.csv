"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm always open to discussing what might work best for both of us.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. This product offers substantial value, and I believe a fairer price would be $1,800,000. This takes into account the potential benefits it holds for your business.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I still think the price is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,400,000 is still too low for me to accept. How about we settle on $1,600,000? I believe this price represents a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
