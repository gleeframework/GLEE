"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I think it would be a great investment for you at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too close to your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $145 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($110) than Alice's asking price ($145). This gives us room to negotiate.
* **Polite and interested:** The message expresses interest in the product but clearly states my budgetary limitations. 
* **Strategic starting point:**  Even if Alice rejects this offer, it sets the stage for negotiation within a range more favorable to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, which is good, but $130 is still a bit high. We started quite low, so there's a good chance we can push for a slightly better deal.  It's worth one more counter-offer before considering John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about $120? That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  Alice came down from $145 to $130. By countering at $120, I'm effectively splitting the difference. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Knowing my limit:** $120 is still comfortably below my maximum budget and a good deal compared to John's price.
* **Sense of urgency:**  By suggesting this is a fair price for ""both of us,"" I'm hinting that this is a good offer and she should consider it seriously."
