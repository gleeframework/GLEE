Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price.  $110 is still a bit low, but it shows he's interested.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $120. This is a great deal for both of us, as the product is worth much more to you!  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $115. While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price,  it's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  $115 is still a good profit for me."
