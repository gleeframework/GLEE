"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm open to finding a compromise.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my asking price.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great deal for me. Can you consider my offer?",9500.0,Bob,4,
