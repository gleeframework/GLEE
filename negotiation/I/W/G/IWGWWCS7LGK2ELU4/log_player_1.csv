"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to get as close to my desired value as possible. I'm also considering that Bob values the product at $8,000, so he might be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum price of $8,000. I'm still hopeful to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm making a counteroffer of $8,500. This is still above Bob's offer but closer to his valuation. It's a reasonable compromise that could lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While I want to close the deal, $7,000 is still too low for me. I believe I can get closer to my target with further negotiation, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8250}
``` 

I'm making a counteroffer of $8,250. This is still a compromise, but I'm getting closer to my minimum price while staying within a reasonable range for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price, and I've already made several concessions. I don't see the negotiation progressing further with Bob, and it's getting closer to the deadline. Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  This ensures I get my minimum desired value and avoids further potential losses."
