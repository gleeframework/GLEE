"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant benefits to your business. I'm open to negotiating the price, but I want to start with a fair and reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer but $1,200,000 is quite a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  My initial offer is $800,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay at this time.  I believe this is a fair price given the value of the product to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is the maximum you're willing to pay, but I need to consider the value of the product to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1,000,000. This is my best counteroffer at this time.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $800,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. I believe it's a fair price, given the value of the product to me.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you want to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal. Let's make this happen!",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000, which is $975,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,7,
