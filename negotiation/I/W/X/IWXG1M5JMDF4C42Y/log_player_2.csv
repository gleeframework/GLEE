"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. Rejecting this offer opens the door for a better deal, whether from Alice in a counter-offer or by sticking with John's offer."
