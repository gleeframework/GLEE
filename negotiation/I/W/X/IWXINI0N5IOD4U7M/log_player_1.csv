{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $10,000. It's a steal considering its value! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation. It also includes a positive message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer! While $10000 is tempting, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm interested in buying the product for $8500. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I can likely do better. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,250.  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a little closer to my target. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9250, but I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to go to $9000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise and significantly higher than John's offer of $8,000.  It's worth accepting to finalize the sale."
