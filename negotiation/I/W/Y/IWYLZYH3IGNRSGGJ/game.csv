"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit too steep for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest,  $6,000 is far below what I'm able to accept at this time.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  I'm confident this product will be a great investment for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $7,000? That's a reasonable compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,000 is still a bit low for me.  Considering the value this product brings, how about we split the difference and go with $8,500?  This would be a win-win for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,5,
