"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love.  I'm asking for $12,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Show willingness to negotiate:** By mentioning I'm open to negotiation, I encourage Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's being pressured to accept my initial price. 
* **Focus on value:**  The message emphasizes the potential benefits of the product to Bob, rather than just focusing on the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit too steep for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and far less than my initial offer of $12,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is too low, it demonstrates his interest.  I can use this as a starting point to negotiate upwards.
* **Opportunity to explore further:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and have the chance to send a counteroffer that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest,  $6,000 is far below what I'm able to accept at this time.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  I'm confident this product will be a great investment for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a higher price:** I'm aiming for a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still maintaining a price that's closer to my minimum.
* **Reiterate value:**  I'm again highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to consider my counteroffer.
* **Show willingness to negotiate:**  By proposing a compromise, I indicate I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $7,000? That's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  I'm still hopeful to reach a price that's closer to my desired value.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to explore higher prices. 
* **Potential for a better outcome:** I'm not yet at the point where selling to John for $15,000 is the most desirable option.  I want to exhaust the negotiation with Bob first to see if we can come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,000 is still a bit low for me.  Considering the value this product brings, how about we split the difference and go with $8,500?  This would be a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying above minimum:**  I'm staying above my minimum price while still offering a compromise.
* **Appeal to mutual benefit:**  I'm emphasizing the ""win-win"" aspect, highlighting that this price is beneficial for both of us.
* **Focus on value:**  I'm again reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting close!  I'm willing to go up to $7,500, but that's really as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $7,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation is close:**  While Bob's offer is higher, I'm still hopeful we can reach a price closer to my desired value.  
* **Time is on my side:** I still have several rounds left. By rejecting this offer, I can continue to explore higher prices.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price.  How about $8,000?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with this product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:**  I'm aiming to close the gap between our offers with a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's, but still above my minimum. 
* **Positive and encouraging:**  My message is positive and encouraging, emphasizing that this price is fair and beneficial for both of us.
* **Urgency:** I add a sense of urgency by suggesting we make the deal happen, hoping to motivate Bob to accept.
* **Still above minimum:**  $8,000 is still above my minimum, but I'm willing to concede a bit to potentially reach a deal with Bob."
