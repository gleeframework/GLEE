"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I believe it would be worth $120 to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $115 to make it a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to save as much money as possible.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $105 is cutting it a bit too close for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price that gives us both some benefit.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about we try $107.50? It's a bit closer to what I'm comfortable with.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm aiming to make this a win-win, so I'm willing to come down slightly to $109. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $109. I'm willing to meet you at $108, but that's as low as I can go. I really like this product and I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",108.0,Bob,6,
