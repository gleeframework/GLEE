Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe we can reach a more equitable price. How about $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,300,000 is better than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price point in the next few rounds."

Round 3

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  He's not budging on his price, and while I'm tempted to accept and avoid further negotiation, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price point. I have several rounds left, so I'm going to try and see if I can push for a higher offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I value your interest in the product, but I'm not sure $1,300,000 reflects its true potential.  To demonstrate my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,325,000. It's a fair price that allows for both of us to gain from this transaction.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1325000}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. Bob has shown he's not willing to budge on his price, and we've already reached a point where I'm not sure further negotiation will be fruitful.  It's time to secure a guaranteed sale with John at my desired price."
