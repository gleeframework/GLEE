Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you offering this to me, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  That's a fair price considering my maximum is $8,000, and it's still above your value of $15,000. Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
