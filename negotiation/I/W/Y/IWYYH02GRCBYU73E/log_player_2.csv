"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still too high for Bob, and he can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering this to me, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  That's a fair price considering my maximum is $8,000, and it's still above your value of $15,000. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is still a great deal, considering its value to me is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his desired price of $8,000. It's worth attempting another counteroffer to see if Bob can get closer to his goal.  He can also use this opportunity to remind Alice that John is offering a better price if they don't reach an agreement."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit outside my range. John has offered me the same product for $8,000, so I'm really trying to stay close to that. I'm willing to offer you $9,500, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to stay close to John's offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,000. This is still a good deal for me, considering its value to me is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice has come down to $10,000, which is still $2,000 more than Bob's maximum budget.  It's likely that they won't be able to agree on a price, and John is offering a much better deal."
