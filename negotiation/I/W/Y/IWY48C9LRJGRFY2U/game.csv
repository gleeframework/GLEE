"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a concession to get us started.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $800,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you, and I'm willing to make a concession to get us closer to a deal.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I believe the product has real value, $700,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Could we agree on $600,000? That would allow me to make the purchase and would still be a good price for you.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $600,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession to get us closer to a deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $650,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",650000.0,Alice,5,
