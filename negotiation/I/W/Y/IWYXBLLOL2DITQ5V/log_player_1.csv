"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love! I'm starting the offer at $11,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's value for the product. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not starting at my absolute minimum, which would make it harder to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product and would like to make a counteroffer of $10,000. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $10,000 is below my minimum value of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:**  There is still room for negotiation as Bob acknowledges the value of the product. 
* **Potential for a higher offer:**  I believe there's a chance I can get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, but still lower than my initial offer, to keep the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I come down to $11,000?  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price.
* **Maintain Value:** $11,000 is still above my minimum value, ensuring I get a fair return.
* **Encouraging Language:** I'm highlighting the benefits of reaching a deal and finding a price that works for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $10,500. I hope this proposal is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $10,500 is still below my minimum value of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  While Bob has not budged much, he's still willing to negotiate.  
* **Risk of selling to John:** Selling to John would guarantee me $12,000, but there's still a chance I could get closer to that with Bob.  

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer again, aiming to get closer to my minimum while acknowledging Bob's limited budget. I'll need to be persuasive and offer a final price that is compelling for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final compromise. How about $11,250? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer, adding urgency to the negotiation.
* **Middle Ground:**  $11,250 is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's, indicating a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Fair Price:** I'm re-framing the price as fair for both parties, making it more palatable to Bob. 
* **Close the Deal:** I'm explicitly suggesting closing the deal, creating a sense of finality."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $11,000 is only $1,000 below my minimum value of $12,000.  
* **Limited negotiation room:** There's less room for further negotiation, and I'm concerned that Bob may not budge further. 
* **Risk of John:**  Selling to John would be more profitable, but I'm worried that I might miss out on a better deal if I wait.  

**Next Steps:** I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good outcome considering the limited negotiation room and the risk of losing the deal to John."
