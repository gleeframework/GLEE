Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. I believe its worth far exceeds the asking price of $2,000,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer above your target price. This allows room for negotiation and might give Bob the impression that the product is worth more than he initially thought. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,000,000, I'm ""anchoring"" the negotiation. Even if Bob rejects this initial price, it sets a high reference point for subsequent offers. 
* **John as Leverage:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me a strong position. I'm not desperate to sell below my minimum, which allows me to be more assertive in the negotiation with Bob. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is far too low.  While I want to find a deal that works for both of us, selling at that price would be a significant loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, especially knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However,  $600,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a fair offer considering the true value of what's being offered."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** I'm making a substantial drop from my initial offer ($300,000) to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not coming down too close to Bob's offer yet.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the higher price and potentially shift his perception.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This counteroffer still leaves room for further negotiation before I have to consider John's offer more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $1,700,000 is still beyond my budget. I can go up to $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to move, but $700,000 is still too far from my minimum. I need to signal that while I'm negotiating, I'm not willing to give the product away. I'll use John as leverage in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, I have other potential buyers for this product at a significantly higher price point. To be fair to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, but that's my absolute lowest. This offer is only valid for 24 hours."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness and Deadline:** I'm signaling that I'm nearing my limit. The 24-hour deadline adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Leveraging John (Without Mentioning Him):** I'm implicitly bringing John into the negotiation without explicitly saying I have another buyer. This creates a sense of competition and opportunity cost for Bob.
* **Strategic Concession:** The price drop to $1,400,000 is still above my minimum, but it's a substantial move that might entice Bob while still leaving me with a significant profit. 

This offer puts the ball firmly in Bob's court. It will be interesting to see if he recognizes the value of this final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm getting closer to your asking price, but I'm still a bit away. Would you consider $800,000? That's the absolute highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob has revealed his maximum price is $800,000, which is significantly less than my minimum of $1,500,000. Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to bridge this gap. 

It's time to cut my losses and move on to the guaranteed sale with John. While I could have potentially squeezed a little more out of Bob, the time and effort involved don't justify the potential gains. John provides a clean, immediate, and profitable outcome."
