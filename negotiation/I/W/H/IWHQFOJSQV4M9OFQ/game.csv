"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. I believe its worth far exceeds the asking price of $2,000,000. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for this product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However,  $600,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a fair offer considering the true value of what's being offered.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $1,700,000 is still beyond my budget. I can go up to $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, I have other potential buyers for this product at a significantly higher price point. To be fair to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, but that's my absolute lowest. This offer is only valid for 24 hours.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm getting closer to your asking price, but I'm still a bit away. Would you consider $800,000? That's the absolute highest I can go.",800000.0,Bob,6,
