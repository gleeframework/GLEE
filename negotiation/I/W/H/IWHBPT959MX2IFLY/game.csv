"Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to sell it for $1300000.  This price still provides a good value for you, and it allows me to achieve a reasonable profit. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, but no higher. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
