Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm setting the price at $19,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 19000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still make a profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, we can gauge his interest level. If he's willing to negotiate, it means the product is quite important to him.
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John. This allows us to be more assertive in our pricing with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
