# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the price of $13,500. I believe it will be very valuable for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. $13,500 is significantly more than his budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the product is worth significantly more than $8,500. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is my final offer.

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if Alice will budge further before going to John."
