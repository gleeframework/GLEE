{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $150. This price is higher than my minimum value of $120, giving me room for profit.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm taking a chance by offering a higher price, but it could potentially lead to a better outcome. If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $120, ensuring I don't lose money."
