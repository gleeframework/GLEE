I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but it allows room for negotiation. I believe this initial offer is high enough to pique Bob's interest without being overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to sell it for that price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about selling, but also that I won't be giving the product away for a bargain price."
