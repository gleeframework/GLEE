"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth a lot more than that. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $1,100,000?  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and would still be a great investment for you. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. The product is truly unique and has the potential to bring you substantial value.  I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000 to meet you halfway.  This is a final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll need to consider other options. ",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
