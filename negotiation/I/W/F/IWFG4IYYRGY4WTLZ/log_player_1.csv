"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefits of the product and creating a sense of urgency.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

This first offer is designed to gauge Bob's interest and set the starting point for the negotiation.  I'll use the next few rounds to adjust my offer based on Bob's response and the remaining time.  If Bob is unwilling to negotiate, I'm prepared to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have 9 rounds left, so I can afford to be patient and try to secure a better price.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  However, if he continues to be unwilling to budge, I'll seriously consider selling to John as the rounds progress."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth a lot more than that. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $1,100,000?  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and would still be a great investment for you. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and firmness:**  I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, but I'm also remaining firm about the product's value.
* **Focus on value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's inherent worth and emphasizing the potential return on his investment.
* **Time pressure:** I'm subtly implying that time is running out by mentioning the need for a ""fair price.""

**Strategy:**

By offering $1,100,000, I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's appealing to both of us.  If Bob still insists on a price closer to $900,000, I'll consider further concessions, but I'll be more inclined to sell to John if he refuses to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob has increased his offer to $1,050,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  There's a gap between our offers, but there's still room for further negotiation.
* **Time is still on my side:** I have 6 rounds left, so I can afford to continue to try and secure a better price.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value. However, I'm also becoming more aware that I might need to seriously consider selling to John if Bob continues to be unwilling to budge.  I need to start weighing the risks of losing a potential deal with Bob against the certainty of a $1,500,000 sale to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. The product is truly unique and has the potential to bring you substantial value.  I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000 to meet you halfway.  This is a final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll need to consider other options. "", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm signaling that this is my last concession. 
* **Emphasize value:** I'm highlighting the product's uniqueness and potential benefits again.
* **Create pressure:**  I'm setting a deadline by stating that I'll have to consider other options if we can't reach an agreement.

**Strategy:**

This round is crucial. I'm making a significant concession, but I'm also making it clear that I'm not willing to go any lower.  If Bob accepts, I'll have secured a good deal. If he rejects, I'll be forced to weigh my options seriously.  I'm getting closer to John's offer, and it's becoming more tempting with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're down to 4 rounds, and Bob's offer is still significantly below my desired price.
* **Little room for negotiation:**  The gap between our offers is shrinking, but I doubt Bob will budge much more.
* **John's offer is tempting:**  With only a few rounds left, selling to John for $1,500,000 is becoming increasingly attractive.

**Strategy:**

I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can secure a price close to my minimum acceptable value within the remaining rounds.  Given John's offer, it's more sensible to take the guaranteed profit and sell to him rather than risk a lower price with Bob."
