"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in your product, but I'd be willing to pay $140 for it.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $145. This seems like a fair compromise, considering I'm already paying above my maximum limit. What do you say?",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $145. How about we settle on $155? That way we both get a good deal and can move forward with the sale.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $155 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $150, which is my absolute maximum. If we can agree on this, we can close the deal. If not, I'll have to consider my other options.",150.0,Bob,6,
