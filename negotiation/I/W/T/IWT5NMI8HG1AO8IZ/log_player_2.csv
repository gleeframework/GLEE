"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that I believe is truly exceptional and valuable to you. This product holds a significant worth of $1500000 to you, and I am excited to offer it to you at a carefully considered price that reflects its true value while ensuring a fair transaction for both parties.

To make this offer even more compelling, I propose to sell the product to you for $1400000. This price not only represents a substantial discount compared to its intrinsic value but also allows us to collaborate on a mutually beneficial deal.

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. I am confident that you will find the product to be a valuable addition to your collection or business, and I look forward to the possibility of working together.

Best regards,
Alice

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product. Alice is offering it for $1,400,000, which is still within your budget. However, you can get the product from John for $1,500,000, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John will save you $100,000."
