Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,100,000 is a substantial offer, the product's value warrants a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. However, I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. Would you consider $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is incrementally increasing his offer. It's worth seeing how high he'll go."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,192,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,192,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,192,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently increasing his offer, but the increments are getting smaller. Accepting at $1,192,500 secures a substantial profit over John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer in subsequent rounds."
