"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is far too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This product truly is worth it.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.",12000.0,Bob,4,
