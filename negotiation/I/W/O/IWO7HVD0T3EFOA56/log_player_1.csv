"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $22,000. I think it's a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is far too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This product truly is worth it."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving in the right direction, the negotiation is progressing slowly and his offer is still significantly below John's guaranteed offer. It's unlikely Bob will reach $15,000 within the remaining rounds."
