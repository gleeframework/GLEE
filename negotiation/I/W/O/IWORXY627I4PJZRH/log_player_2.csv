You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can likely get a better price than $7,200.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6500}
```

I'm starting with a lower price than Alice's offer, but still within the range of what I'm willing to pay. This should start the negotiation and give me a chance to see if Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and $6,800 is a good deal for me. It's worth accepting this offer and saving $1,200."
