"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for it. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. While $1,900,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $1,700,000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
