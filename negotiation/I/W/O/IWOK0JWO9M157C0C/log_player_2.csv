"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $8,000.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm happy to buy the product for $7,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $7,250. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $7,250, which is still a good deal for Bob.  While he could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at $8,000.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price below his maximum and avoids further negotiation."
