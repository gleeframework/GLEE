Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential value I see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $950,000, I'm aiming for a higher price.  I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob or secure the $1,200,000 from John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,050,000, but I'm still a bit over my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. This price reflects the value I see in the product and the tight limitations on my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  It's better than the $950,000 he initially offered, and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer. It's time to close the deal."
