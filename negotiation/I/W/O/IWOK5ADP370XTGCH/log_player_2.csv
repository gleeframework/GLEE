"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value and the benefits it will bring you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential value I see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate.  It's also within his budget, and leaves some room for further negotiation if needed. This counteroffer sets a strong starting point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above Bob's maximum budget. He can still potentially get a better deal, so rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate makes sense. There's a good chance Alice will come down further, as she's already shown a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,050,000, but I'm still a bit over my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. This price reflects the value I see in the product and the tight limitations on my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is pushing for his maximum budget, hoping Alice will accept. This counteroffer directly addresses Alice's previous offer and shows Bob's firm stance. It's also the price at which he could purchase the product from John, giving him a leverage point if Alice refuses."
