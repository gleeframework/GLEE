"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,100,000. I would like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for presenting your counter-proposal. While I understand your constraints, the value this product brings to the table is substantial. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't accept a price as low as $950,000.  How would you feel about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
