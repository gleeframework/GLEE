Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is quite high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $12,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending. How about $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  While $13,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $11,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and would allow me to make this purchase.
