"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find valuable.  Given its unique benefits, I'm offering it to you at a price of $11,000.  I think it's a fair price that reflects the value it will bring you."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
 
I'm starting with a high price, close to Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a significant profit.  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial ask. While it's above my minimum, I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my target. I'm willing to counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional value."", ""product_price"": 10250}

I've chosen to counteroffer with a price that splits the difference between Bob's offer and my previous ask. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong profit. I've reiterated the product's value to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that price. How about we try $9,800? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob is negotiating more aggressively now, but he's still within a reasonable range.  While $9,800 is tempting, I'm going to push a bit further. I want to see if I can get closer to $10,000 before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay at $10,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value."", ""product_price"": 10000}

I'm making a smaller concession this round and presenting it as my final offer. This signals that I'm reaching my limit while still leaving room for Bob to accept a price above his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we try $9,500? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob has returned to his previous offer of $9,500.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,000, it's becoming clear that this is likely his ceiling.  Accepting now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling. This price still provides a reasonable profit above my minimum."
