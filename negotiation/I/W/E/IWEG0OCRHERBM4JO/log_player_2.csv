"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $100, while John is selling it for $120. 
* **It's within your budget:**  The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice's offer is below that.

Even though you could save $20 by waiting for John, it's still a good deal to accept Alice's offer and get the product for less than your maximum price."
