It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  $120 is still above your maximum value for the product."

While $100 is closer to my limit, I'm still willing to try and negotiate further.  It's likely Alice is willing to come down a bit more since she rejected my previous counteroffer."

I'm still holding out for a better deal. It's possible I can get Alice down to $90, and that's only $10 more than John's price."

$92 is close to my maximum value, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid potentially losing the deal entirely."
