"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1,000,000. I would like to propose an offer of $850,000 to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  While I recognize the value you see in the product, I believe its potential warrants a higher price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000. This offer reflects a fair balance between its intrinsic worth and our mutual desire for a successful transaction.",950000.0,Alice,3,
