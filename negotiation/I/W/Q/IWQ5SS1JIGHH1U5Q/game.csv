"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to give up yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more, so I'll offer you a price of $11,000. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you!",11000.0,Alice,5,
