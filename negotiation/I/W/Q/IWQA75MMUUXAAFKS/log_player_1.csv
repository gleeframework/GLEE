Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,200,000. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,150,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  If I can't get what I need, I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,200,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,150,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $1,200,000 for this. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's meet in the middle, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking to make a profit, but I'm not willing to go above $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a better deal. How about $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I've given him a few chances to negotiate, but he's not budging. It's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000 and ensure I get my desired profit."
