Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have a strong position to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** A starting price of $1,900,000 allows you to gauge Bob's eagerness and potentially secure a significant profit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still come down while remaining above your minimum acceptable price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, he may not be willing to pay that much.  Consider factors like his budget and negotiation style.
* **Relationship Building:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, you might adjust your starting price to be slightly less aggressive."
