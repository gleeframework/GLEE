"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, aiming for a good profit.  This leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum value of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $105 is better than selling to John, I still have room for negotiation and want to try to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm counteroffering at $115. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a more reasonable price than my initial offer.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price,  $110 is a good profit and it's likely we're nearing the end of the negotiation.  There's a risk of further counteroffers bringing the price down or of Bob getting frustrated and walking away.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing money or missing out on a sale."
