{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $12,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for a potential win-win scenario.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob to justify the price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer is not outrageous, leaving space for Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling like he's being taken advantage of.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and potentially adjust my price downwards. However, if his counteroffer is too low or if the negotiations drag on, I'll be prepared to walk away and sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I can't afford to sell for less than that.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob has shown interest, and I can try to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John for $8,000 is guaranteed, I'm taking a calculated risk by continuing negotiations with Bob. If I can get a price closer to $12,000, it's worth the effort.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price between $9,000 and $12,000. I'll try to find a price that is reasonable for both of us. If Bob rejects my counteroffer again, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $10,500? This still gives you a good deal and allows me to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $9,000. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating that this is still a good deal for Bob, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging to maintain a good relationship with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be acceptable to Bob. If he rejects it, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John. However, I'm still optimistic about getting a better price than $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $10,250? I think that's the sweet spot for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $10,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I'd prefer more, it's a significant profit and worth considering.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** If I reject, there's no guarantee Bob will counter with a better offer. He might even walk away.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The risk of continuing is that Bob might walk away, leaving me with only the $8,000 option. The reward is a slightly higher price, but it's not a substantial difference.

**Next Steps:**

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'm happy to have closed the deal, I'll keep in mind that I could have potentially pushed for a slightly higher price if I had been more persistent. However, given the circumstances, this is a good outcome."
