"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go below $12500. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll sell the product to you for $12750. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12750.0,Alice,5,
