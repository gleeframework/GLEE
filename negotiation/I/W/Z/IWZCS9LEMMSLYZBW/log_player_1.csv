"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my desired value than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Not too aggressive:**  I'm not starting at a price that would immediately make Bob walk away. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  A $12,000 price allows for several rounds of negotiation before I might consider John's offer of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can offer you a fairer deal. How about $10,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I have 8 rounds left to improve the offer. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:** John's offer of $15,000 provides a strong safety net, so I can afford to be patient and potentially get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $11,500? This reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $12,000 to $11,500.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm still highlighting the product's value to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the conversation positive to maintain a good rapport.
* **Room for negotiation:** I still have some room to negotiate lower if needed, but I'm getting closer to a potentially acceptable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I still believe we can reach an agreement closer to my previous offer. How about $11,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired value, $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Potential for better deal:**  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with more negotiation.
* **John's offer as a safety net:** John's offer of $15,000 gives me the security to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. $11,000 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the difference - I'll accept $11,250 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing continued flexibility by offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Fairness emphasis:** I'm framing the offer as fair and mutually beneficial.
* **Confidence:** I'm expressing confidence in the value of the product and the deal.
* **Closing the gap:**  I'm trying to close the gap between our positions and increase the chances of a deal."
