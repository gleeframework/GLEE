"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $10,000 to you, as you mentioned.  Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I'm not sure if I can afford $17,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $14,000?  That's still a significant discount from my original offer and a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still willing to work with you, but $11,500 is simply not enough for me. I'm prepared to walk away from this deal if I don't get closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That's a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to walk away, but I'm still very interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one final concession. $12,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on.  Let me know your decision.",13500.0,Alice,7,
