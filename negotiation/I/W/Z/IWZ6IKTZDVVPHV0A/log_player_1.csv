Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $10,000 to you, as you mentioned.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm not sure if I can afford $17,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $15,000. I'll counter with a price closer to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $14,000?  That's still a significant discount from my original offer and a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $11,500, it's still below my minimum of $15,000, and John is ready to buy at that price.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to what I need."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still willing to work with you, but $11,500 is simply not enough for me. I'm prepared to walk away from this deal if I don't get closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That's a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to walk away, but I'm still very interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,500 is getting closer, I still want to try and get more, especially since I know I can sell to John for $15,000.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one final concession. $12,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 13500}
