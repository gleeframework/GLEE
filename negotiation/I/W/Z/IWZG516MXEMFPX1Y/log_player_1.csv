"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This gives me a decent starting point and leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will be willing to pay more than the minimum of $15,000 since the product is worth that much to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $16,000 is better than the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can come to a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $17,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer. I hope this shows my willingness to negotiate but also demonstrates that I'm not willing to sell for significantly less than what the product is worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price,  $16,500 is a fair price for both of us. This deal ensures I get a good profit while keeping Bob as a potential customer for future transactions."
