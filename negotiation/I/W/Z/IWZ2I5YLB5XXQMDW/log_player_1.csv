Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Minimum Value:** You know the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to you.
* **Potential Upward Value:** You don't know Bob's valuation, but there's a chance he might be willing to pay more. 
* **Risk Mitigation:** Offering a price higher than John's offer ($1,200,000) allows for potential profit while still guaranteeing you a sale.

**Why not go higher?** The higher the price, the less likely Bob is to accept.  A price too far above your minimum value could be off-putting, even if Bob is very interested.  $1,500,000 is a reasonable starting point that balances risk and potential reward."
