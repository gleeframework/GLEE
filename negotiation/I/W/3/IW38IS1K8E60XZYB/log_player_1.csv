Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you might find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as much money from Bob as possible, without going below my minimum price.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  I know the product is only worth $100 to Bob, so I need to offer a price that's appealing but still profitable.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John, giving me a strong fallback position.

**The Offer:**

By offering the product at $115, I'm aiming for a price that's:

* **Above Bob's Valuation:**  This makes it more likely he'll see it as a good deal.
* **Below My Minimum:**  Ensures I make a profit even if I have to sell to John. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  I make a $15 profit, which is better than selling to John.
* **Bob Rejects:**  I sell to John for $120, ensuring I meet my minimum price."
