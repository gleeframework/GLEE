Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Bob's offer:

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing at a slow rate. It's unlikely we'll reach a price that satisfies me before John finds another buyer.  It's in my best interest to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
