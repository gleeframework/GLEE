"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, say around $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to come closer to our desired price. Let's make this happen!",950000.0,Bob,4,
