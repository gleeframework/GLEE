"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you see in this product, but $14,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is too low for me. Would you consider $13,000? It's a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,500?  This would be a good deal for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
