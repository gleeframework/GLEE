"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. How about $10,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and it fits better within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. That's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product, and it allows me to meet my minimum price point. Let's close this deal!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is a fair price considering your minimum and my budget. Let's find a middle ground and finalize this deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,750 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to go down to $10,875. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal without further delay.  What do you say?",10875.0,Alice,5,
