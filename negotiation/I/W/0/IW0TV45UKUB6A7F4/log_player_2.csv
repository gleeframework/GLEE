"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product for $1,250,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. You can potentially save more money by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer. You'll still be able to purchase from John if the negotiations with Alice fail."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $1,000,000 is certainly a good price, it's unfortunately below what I'm able to accept. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own needs. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above your maximum budget. You can potentially get a better deal by rejecting the offer and counteroffering again. If you don't reach an agreement, you can always purchase the product from John for $1,000,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product to you for $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  At this point, you've already gone back and forth a few times and it's unlikely you'll be able to convince Alice to go lower.  To avoid further negotiation and ensure you get the product within your budget, it's best to accept John's offer of $1,000,000."
