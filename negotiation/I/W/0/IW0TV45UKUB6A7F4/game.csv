"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,000,000 is certainly a good price, it's unfortunately below what I'm able to accept. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own needs. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,150,000 is still outside my budget. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.  I hope we can finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
