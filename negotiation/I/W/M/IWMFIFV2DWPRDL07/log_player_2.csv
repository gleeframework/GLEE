"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for a price that's sure to be a steal!  I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a bit less than its full value.  Let's make a deal!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is more than Alice values the product at, it's still significantly less than your $15,000 maximum and the price John is offering. Accepting this offer saves you the most money."
