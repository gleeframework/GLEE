"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  You have room to negotiate since your maximum price is $1,500,000 and Alice's minimum is likely closer to $1,000,000.  There's a chance you can secure the product for less than $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000, but still within your budget.  It's a strong opening move that signals your willingness to negotiate while also leaving room for further compromise.  This initial counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially lead to a price closer to your target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,300,000, which is a good compromise.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away and you having to pay John's higher price of $1,500,000.  Accepting the offer at $1,300,000 saves you $200,000 compared to John and is a reasonable price considering your budget."
