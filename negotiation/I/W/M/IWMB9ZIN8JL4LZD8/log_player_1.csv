Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit for me that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  I believe Bob is likely to find this offer attractive, considering the product is worth $1,500,000 to him.  We can then negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is still above my minimum acceptable value, it's significantly lower than my initial offer. I believe I can secure a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,300,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a profitable price for me and leaves room for further negotiation. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing to Bob, considering he is willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product."
