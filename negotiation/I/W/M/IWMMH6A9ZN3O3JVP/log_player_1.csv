Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  $950,000 is well above your $800,000 floor, meaning you'll still make a significant profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** $950,000 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It opens the door for negotiation:**  This offer allows for a back-and-forth to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I've done my research and I believe the product is worth that to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's important to remember the value of the product to you.  $800,000 is your absolute minimum, and selling to Bob at that price would leave no room for profit.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering you the product for $875,000. This is a fair compromise and I believe it's still a great deal for you.  Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **It's above my minimum:** $825,000 is a better price than selling to John and is still a decent profit.
* **Negotiation is taking time:**  Further rounds of negotiation could take longer, and I'm not sure if we can close the gap much further. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I keep rejecting, Bob might walk away and I'd have to settle with John's lower offer.

Accepting this offer secures a sale and avoids potential risks."
