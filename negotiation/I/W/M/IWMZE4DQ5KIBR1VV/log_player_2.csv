"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price. You can do better by negotiating.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is only $75,000 above your target price of $800,000.  While further negotiation could potentially get a slightly lower price, the risk of further rounds leading to a rejection and forcing you to buy from John for $800,000 is significant.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product for a price that's close to your ideal target and saves you the time and effort of further negotiations."
