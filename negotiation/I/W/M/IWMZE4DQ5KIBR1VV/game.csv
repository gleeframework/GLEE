"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
