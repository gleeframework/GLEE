Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,800,000 vs. $1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. This might make Bob perceive your offer as more negotiable and potentially encourage a counter-offer within a range favorable to you.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Even if Bob rejects this initial high offer, you have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000. This safety net allows you to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message includes a justification for the high price (""value and potential,"" ""benefits it will bring""). While not overly detailed, it provides a reason beyond just wanting a high profit.

**Important Notes:**

* This strategy is based on the assumption that Bob is unaware of your guaranteed sale to John.
* Bob's personality and negotiation style could influence the outcome. 
* Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters your initial offer."
