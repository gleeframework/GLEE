"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm happy we're getting closer to an agreement. However,  $10,400 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference again and go with $10,500? This is a fair price that recognizes the product's value, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",10500.0,Alice,7,
