"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the value. How about $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save money. 
* The product is worth $120 to Alice, so she's already making a profit. 
* Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  How about $130? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
