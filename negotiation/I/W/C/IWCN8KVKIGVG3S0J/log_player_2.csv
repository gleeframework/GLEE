Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $14,000. I can see you're really interested in the product, so I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $14,000. I'll do $13,750. Let's see if we can make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750

Reasoning: Alice seems firmly set above $13,500. Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to result in a price that's significantly better than John's offer of $15,000. It's time to cut losses and go with the guaranteed deal."
