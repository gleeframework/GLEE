"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point, given the product's worth to both of us. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90. While it's better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with a price of $105. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $95.  While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 102}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $102.  This is another slight compromise, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to finally close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but we're still a bit apart.  I've already used up 5 rounds of negotiation, and I'm concerned that we might not reach an agreement in the remaining rounds. Since John is offering me my minimum price, I'm going to sell to him to ensure I get at least what the product is worth to me."
