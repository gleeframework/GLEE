Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $80 to me, I'll start with a price that's a bit higher than that. Let's say I offer it to Bob for:

{""product_price"": $120}

This is a fair price, considering that the product is worth $150 to Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept the offer and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $100. Since the product is worth at least $80 to me, I'm not thrilled about selling it for $100, but it's a decent offer. I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer and send him a counteroffer to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $100, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than that. Let's say I offer it to Bob for:

{""product_price"": $115}

I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."
