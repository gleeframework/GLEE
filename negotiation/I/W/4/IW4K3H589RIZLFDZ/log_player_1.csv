"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than the product's value to me ($120) to see if I can get a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than my minimum, I think I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit, but still aim for a price higher than my minimum. This should hopefully be acceptable to Bob, while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $115 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a bit longer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to lower my price to my minimum of $120.  It's a fair price for both of us and I'm hoping Bob will accept it. If he doesn't, I can always sell the product to John for the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's not worth the risk of further negotiations. I'm satisfied with John's offer, and I don't want to risk further rounds with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price."
