**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly unwilling to budge below $9,700.  At this point, accepting her ""final offer"" or trying to haggle further is unlikely to result in a significantly better price.  It's better to cut losses and buy from John for $12,000.  While not ideal, this ensures getting the product and avoids potentially wasting more time in a stalled negotiation."
