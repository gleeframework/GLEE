"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I can afford. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However,  $1,200,000 is significantly below its true market value.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the product's worth.  How about we meet halfway at $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. This price acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my financial limits. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Your offer shows you're serious, but we're still apart.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is my final offer. It's a fair price considering the value you're getting.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
