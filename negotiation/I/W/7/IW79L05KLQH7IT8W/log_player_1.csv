Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a chance to acquire something truly exceptional."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to start with a high offer.  This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't sell below your minimum.
* **Emphasis on Value:** The message focuses on the ""value and potential"" of the product, aiming to justify the high price and appeal to Bob's sense of acquiring something significant.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" signals that you are open to discussing the price, encouraging Bob to engage in the conversation.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium above his perceived value. If he counters, you can gradually reduce the price, aiming to maximize profit while staying above your $1,500,000 safety net with John."
