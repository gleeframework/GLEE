"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe holds significant value for your operations. Based on its potential, I'm setting the price at $1,200,000. This price reflects a substantial discount from the true value it holds for you.  I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the discount, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me and your asking price. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. ",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $950,000 is closer to my desired range, I need to make a slightly higher counteroffer to reflect the product's value.  How about $1,050,000? This price still represents a substantial discount for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is getting closer, I'm still a bit too high.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,000,000.  This price is fair to both of us, allowing you to make a decent profit and me to get a good deal.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
