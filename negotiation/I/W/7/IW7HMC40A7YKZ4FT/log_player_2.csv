"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe holds significant value for your operations. Based on its potential, I'm setting the price at $1,200,000. This price reflects a substantial discount from the true value it holds for you.  I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's a discount from the value you place on the product, it's still well above what Alice values it at. This means there's room for negotiation.
* **You have a backup option.** You can buy from John for $1,500,000, so you're not pressured to accept Alice's first offer. 

By rejecting, you open the door to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the discount, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me and your asking price. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, demonstrating your serious intent to negotiate. 
* **Leaves room for compromise:** It's still above Alice's value, giving her space to counter without feeling like she's losing too much. 
* **Focuses on fairness:** Highlighting the value for both parties can help build rapport and facilitate a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $950,000 is closer to my desired range, I need to make a slightly higher counteroffer to reflect the product's value.  How about $1,050,000? This price still represents a substantial discount for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still above your desired price.**  While it's closer, you're still paying more than you'd like.
* **You still have a backup option with John.**  This gives you leverage to continue negotiating. 

Rejecting allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially close the gap further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is getting closer, I'm still a bit too high.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,000,000.
