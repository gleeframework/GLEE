"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I could buy from John for $120, it's worth seeing if I can get a better price from Alice.  Since I know the product is worth no more than $120 to me, I'm not going to accept her initial offer.  Let's see if she'll negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if she doesn't come down.  It also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is within my budget and a good price considering I started at $100.  It's not ideal, but it's a better deal than going to John.  I'm going to accept the offer and close the deal."
