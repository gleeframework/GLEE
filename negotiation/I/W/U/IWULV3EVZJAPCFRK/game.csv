"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $16,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's meet in the middle.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product.  How about $15,500? It's just a little higher than your offer, and it would be a great deal for both of us. Let's close this deal now.",15500.0,Alice,5,
