I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $12,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $16,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 16500}

While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm going to try and negotiate a bit higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product.  How about $15,500? It's just a little higher than your offer, and it would be a great deal for both of us. Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 15500}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum,  I've only got a few rounds left, and I'm not sure if I can get a better price.  It's safer to sell to John and ensure I get my minimum price."
