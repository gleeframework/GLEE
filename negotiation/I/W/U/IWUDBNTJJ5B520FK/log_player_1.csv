Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,400,000 is higher than your minimum of $1,200,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so there's still room for him to counter and for you to potentially increase the price.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows you're confident in the product's value while leaving room for compromise. 

Remember, the key is to find the highest price Bob is willing to pay while still keeping him engaged in the negotiation."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you can still potentially get a better price. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired $1,400,000. This keeps the negotiation going and allows you to explore if there's room for a higher price within Bob's budget."
