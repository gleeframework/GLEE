"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $9,000 is a bit too far below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $11,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway with your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  To be honest, I'm feeling a bit stuck at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $10,800 as a final offer.  This is a considerable discount from my initial price, and it's very close to what I need to make this work.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this last offer. If not, I understand, and I'll have to explore other options.",10800.0,Alice,5,
