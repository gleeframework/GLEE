Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to sell, but $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.

Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 950000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  We're down to the last 4 rounds and Bob keeps offering a price lower than my minimum. While there's a chance he might raise his offer, it's not worth risking that. I'm confident that I can get a better deal with John, who's willing to pay my asking price."
