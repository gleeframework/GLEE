"Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Could you do $12,000? That's already a significant discount from my initial asking price.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,500. Can we make a deal at this price?",10500.0,Bob,4,
