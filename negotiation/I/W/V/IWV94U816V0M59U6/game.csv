"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $105.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $105 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $85.  If we can't come to an agreement at that price, I'll have to go with another seller.",85.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $90. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $95.",95.0,Alice,7,
