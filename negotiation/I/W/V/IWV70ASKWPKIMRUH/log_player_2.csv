"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000.  This price reflects the potential benefits you'll gain from this product.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always better to pay the lower price. Since John is offering the product for $1,000,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at $1,050,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can still get the product for a lower price from John."
