"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum valuation of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $12,000 for this.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to adjust, Alice. Considering the value I place on the product, I would like to counter with an offer of $11,000. I believe this strikes a fair balance between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not willing to accept such a significant loss on the product. I believe we can still negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $11,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $11,500 is my absolute minimum.  If you're serious about purchasing the product, let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I am willing to consider $11,300 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, $11,300 is a significant improvement over Bob's previous offers and is above my minimum valuation of $10,000. It's time to close the deal."
