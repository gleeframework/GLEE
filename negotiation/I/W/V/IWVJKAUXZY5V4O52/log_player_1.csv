{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a bit above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000 but leaves room for negotiation. It also keeps me significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  This strategy allows me to potentially earn more than selling to John while still keeping the option to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm open to negotiating, I won't accept an offer that doesn't at least come close to my value for the product.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,100,000.  Would you be open to a price of $1,150,000?  This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

This counteroffer is still above Bob's offer but shows that I'm willing to negotiate. It also keeps me above my minimum price while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,075,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not quite enough.  I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and I don't want to risk getting stuck at a price lower than my minimum.  John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is the best option for me at this point."
