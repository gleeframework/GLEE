"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,100,000.  Would you be open to a price of $1,150,000?  This would give us both a good deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,075,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
