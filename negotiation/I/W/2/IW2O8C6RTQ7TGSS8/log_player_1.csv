Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,800,000 was a bit ambitious. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,650,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This price is a fair compromise for both of us and leaves some room for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's clear further negotiation might not bridge the gap quickly enough. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000 which is better than the current offer and saves time/potential further haggling."
