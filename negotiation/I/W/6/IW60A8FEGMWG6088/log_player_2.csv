"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $13,000. I think it will be very valuable for you, and this is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $13,000 is way above his budget, and he has a better option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit above what I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to buy it for $8,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer, closer to his maximum budget, but still leaves room for potential negotiation. He's also acknowledging Alice's offer and trying to build a rapport."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $8,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum.  He has a better option to get the product for $8,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both walk away happy. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

Bob is again moving closer to his maximum budget, but still leaving some room for negotiation. He's also emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect to potentially incentivize Alice to accept."
