"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's work together to find a solution.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $825,000, but I'm still a bit above $750,000. How about we meet in the middle at $787,500?",787500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $787,500, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $800,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",800000.0,Alice,5,
