Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts - this offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Justification for the price:**  While not explicitly stating the product's value to Bob, the message hints at its ""incredible value and potential,"" aiming to justify the high price.
* **Time pressure:** The 24-hour limit aims to create a sense of urgency and potentially discourage Bob from extensive negotiation.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit by:

1. **Potentially securing a much higher price from Bob.**
2. **Falling back on the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John** if Bob rejects the offer."
