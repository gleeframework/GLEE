"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $900,000. I believe this price reflects its value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.  I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob or John, so I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $700,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to come down slightly.  I'd accept $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the value I know this product offers.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I'm still aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hesitant to accept it.  I have limited rounds and John is waiting to buy the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to take one more round to see if I can push Bob higher or else I'll move on to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to avoid selling to John at a lower profit.  Let's finalize this deal, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
