,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $105?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $105 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  Let's split the difference. How about $100? That way we both get a fair deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
