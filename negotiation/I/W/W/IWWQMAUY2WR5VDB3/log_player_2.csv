"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
It's never a good idea to accept the first offer in a negotiation. There's room to try and get the price down.  I'll make a counteroffer to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $8,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to bring the price down significantly. It's important to start with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a great price considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is coming down in price, $9,500 is still closer to her desired price than mine. I'll make another counteroffer to try and close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?"",

}
``` 

This counter-offer shows I'm willing to compromise and move closer to her price, while still aiming for a price that benefits me."
