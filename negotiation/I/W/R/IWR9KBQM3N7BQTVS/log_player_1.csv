I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  His offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and I'm confident I can get a better deal.  It's still early in the negotiation process, and I want to see if I can convince Bob to come closer to my initial price."

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not enough. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating. I'm confident I can get a better price, and I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $1,100,000 at this point."

With only a few rounds left, Bob's offer is still not close enough to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm getting concerned that we won't be able to reach an agreement within the remaining time.  I'm going to sell the product to John, as I'm guaranteed a higher price that meets my minimum requirements."
