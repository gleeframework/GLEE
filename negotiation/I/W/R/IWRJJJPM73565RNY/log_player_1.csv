Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still potentially attractive to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed, and I'm confident John will be there if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While $120 is more than he values the product at, it is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, and if that fails I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more attractive to Bob while still allowing me to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $140 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough for me to make a profit I'm comfortable with. John is offering me a price that meets my minimum, and I'm confident I can make a better deal by going with him."
