"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but $7,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $7,200. It's a fair price considering the unique value it offers. What do you think?",7200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $7,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",7100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $7,300. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $7,250?",7250.0,Alice,5,
