"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  We're aiming to get closer to $110. By rejecting, we signal the price isn't acceptable and open the door for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $90 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product is worth a lot to both of us, and I want to find a price that's fair for us both.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While not ideal, $95 is a reasonable profit above our minimum. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield significantly more. Accepting avoids the risk of Bob walking away and ensures a good profit."
