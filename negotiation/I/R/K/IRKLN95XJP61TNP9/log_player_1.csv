"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. My initial price is $1,150,000. I'm open to discussion, but I'm certain we can find a price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is quite tight. I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,050,000. I believe there's room for negotiation and I can likely get a higher price if I counteroffer.  I also have the option of selling to John if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is still below my minimum. However, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's split the difference. I'll accept $1,100,000 for the product. This would give you a great deal, and it would still be a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
