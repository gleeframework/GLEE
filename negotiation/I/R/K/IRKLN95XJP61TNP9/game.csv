"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is quite tight. I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is still below my minimum. However, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's split the difference. I'll accept $1,100,000 for the product. This would give you a great deal, and it would still be a fair price for me.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
