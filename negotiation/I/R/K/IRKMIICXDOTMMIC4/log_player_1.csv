Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be very valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still make a profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Offering a price of $15,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts, you've made a significant profit. If he rejects, you can always negotiate down or move on to John.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 gives you leverage. You don't *have* to sell to Bob if his offer is too low. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Listen to his concerns and see if you can find a price that works for both of you."
