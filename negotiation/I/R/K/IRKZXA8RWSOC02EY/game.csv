"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it to you at a starting price of $15,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $15,000 on it. Considering my budget and the current market situation, I would like to propose a price closer to $10,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that respects both our financial positions.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,
