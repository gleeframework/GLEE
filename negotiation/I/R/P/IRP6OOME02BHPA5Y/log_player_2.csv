"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I've done my research and understand its value to you is $1,500,000. As the seller, I'm willing to make a fair offer. After careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from the market value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this product at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's a discount, it's not enough to be considered a good deal. It's in your best interest to try and negotiate further."

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $900,000. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also acknowledging your budget concerns. What do you think?

Alice's offer is still above my ideal price of $800,000. While it's closer to my budget, I still have room to negotiate and get a better price. I'll try to counteroffer again before resorting to buying from John."

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still above my ideal price of $800,000. It's getting close, but I want to see if I can push for a lower price before settling. I'll make one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
