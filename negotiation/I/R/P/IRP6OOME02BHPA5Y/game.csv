"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I've done my research and understand its value to you is $1,500,000. As the seller, I'm willing to make a fair offer. After careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from the market value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this product at a competitive price. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate the discount. However, I'm still looking for a price closer to $800,000.  I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This would still leave you a significant profit and allow me to purchase the product within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $900,000. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also acknowledging your budget concerns. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,050,000 is still outside of my comfort zone. I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This offers you a good profit margin while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $950,000. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm proposing a new price of $1,025,000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but it's still a significant discount from the original value. I'm confident that this price will be more acceptable to both of us. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  While $1,025,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the highest I can go at this point.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
