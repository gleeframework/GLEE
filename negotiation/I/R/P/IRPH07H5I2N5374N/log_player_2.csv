"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $1,400,000 is a good price, Bob can likely do better. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to drop the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product as close to his ideal price as possible, so he starts with a significant counteroffer at $1,200,000. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to walk away if the price isn't right. It's a bold move, but it could lead to a faster negotiation if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but Bob still has room to negotiate.  He's willing to pay a bit more than his initial counteroffer, but it's worth trying to get the price lower before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's price. He's willing to compromise a bit more, but he's still pushing for a better deal. This counteroffer shows that he's serious about getting the product but also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
