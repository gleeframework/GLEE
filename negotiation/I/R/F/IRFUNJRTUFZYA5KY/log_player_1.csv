Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

We're still significantly above Bob's valuation and below John's guaranteed offer. There's room for negotiation."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go as low as $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140.

Bob is now offering a price higher than his initial valuation and only slightly below John's offer. Accepting minimizes further risk of losing both buyers."
