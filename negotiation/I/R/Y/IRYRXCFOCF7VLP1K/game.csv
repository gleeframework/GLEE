"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product,  $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Would you be open to that?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to ensure we're both satisfied with the transaction. I propose a price of $15000 for the product. This brings us closer to your budget while still allowing me to achieve a fair return for the product. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I'm getting closer to a number that works for me, $15000 is still a bit above my comfort zone.  How about $12500? It's a fair compromise for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,

This is a reasonable midpoint between our previous offers. Let me know if this works for you.",13750.0,Alice,5,
