"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's closer to my value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his perceived value, and if not, how much he's willing to pay.  I'm also setting a positive tone to encourage a good negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $90? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value for the product. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That way, we both get a fair deal.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $95, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for $100 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but I'm still not quite there yet.  $95 is a great offer, but I need to get at least $100 to make this work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $97.50.  This is my final offer, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 97.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $97.50 is still a little more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go to $96.  This is my final offer, let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's close to my minimum, I still believe I can get a slightly better price. It's risky, but I'm going to counteroffer in the next round to try and get closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $96 is still a bit below what I need.  To be fair, I'm willing to lower my offer to $96.50.  This is a true compromise, and I really hope we can reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 96.5}
