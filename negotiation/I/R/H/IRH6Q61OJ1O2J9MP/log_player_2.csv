Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That way, we both get a fair deal.  Let me know what you think!

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you, but I'm still not quite there yet.  $95 is a great offer, but I need to get at least $100 to make this work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $97.50.  This is my final offer, what do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:

Round 6

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $96 is still a bit below what I need.  To be fair, I'm willing to lower my offer to $96.50.  This is a true compromise, and I really hope we can reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $96.5. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to your desired price, you've already used several rounds and it's likely you won't be able to negotiate a lower price. You're running out of time, and you've established a solid alternative with John. It's best to secure the product from John for $80, ensuring you get the best deal within your budget."
