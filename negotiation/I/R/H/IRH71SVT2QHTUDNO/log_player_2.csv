"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $20,000, considering its value and potential. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's start negotiating. Alice's initial offer is way too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

I'm starting with a low offer to see how Alice responds.  This gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below my $12,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $16,000 is still too high. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $16,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Could you consider $10,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering the current market value."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm keeping it firmly below my maximum.  Mentioning ""market value"" might encourage her to be more reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  I appreciate your perspective on the market value, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we settle on $14,000? That's a significant reduction on my part and demonstrates my eagerness to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting close, but I'm sticking to my goal of staying below $12,000.  One more counter offer should do the trick."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we're getting close!  I'm ready to make this deal happen.  Would you consider $11,000?  That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

I'm pushing a little closer to my limit with this offer, but I'm also making it clear this is my final offer. This might encourage Alice to accept rather than risk losing the sale altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're really close! I appreciate you coming up on the price. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $15,000.  However, I value our discussions and believe you'll truly benefit from this product. If you can meet me at $13,000, we have a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go below $13,000, and I'm not willing to go above $12,000.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's offer."
