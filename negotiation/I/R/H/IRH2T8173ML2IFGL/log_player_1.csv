Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in your product, though.  How about $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
