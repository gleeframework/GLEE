"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's above his budget, and he can get the product for less from John."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in your product, though.  How about $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750? This would allow me to make a fair profit while still being attractive to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750.

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than John's offer. Bob should buy the product from John for $8,000 to save money."
