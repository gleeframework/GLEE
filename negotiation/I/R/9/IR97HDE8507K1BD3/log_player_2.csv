# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $65 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. It's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $75 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about $85? It's a good price for both of us and ensures we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $85, and it's not worth risking her rejecting the offer and potentially losing the guaranteed $80 deal with John."
