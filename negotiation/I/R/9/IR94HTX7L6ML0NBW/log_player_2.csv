"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at over $1 million to me, but I'm willing to start negotiations at $1,150,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and provides an excellent opportunity for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is below his maximum, it's still a significant amount. It's worth exploring if he can get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000.  I believe this price is still fair considering the value you place on the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. This price is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still aiming to save more. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if he can get closer to his target price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still hopeful we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This is a good compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price given your value for the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,075,000.  But to be honest, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  Let's try $1,090,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and offers you a great deal.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Alice has come down to $1,090,000, which is closer to Bob's target price of $1,050,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While Bob could try another counteroffer, there's a risk Alice might reject it, and they could end up stuck with John's higher price.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only five rounds left, it's prudent to consider locking in a price that's within Bob's budget, especially since John's offer is looming.

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob secures a decent deal at $1,090,000, which is within his budget and significantly lower than John's price."
