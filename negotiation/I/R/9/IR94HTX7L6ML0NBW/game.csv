"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000.  I believe this price is still fair considering the value you place on the product.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. This price is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still hopeful we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This is a good compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price given your value for the product.  Let's close this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,075,000.  But to be honest, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  Let's try $1,090,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and offers you a great deal.  Let's make this happen.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
