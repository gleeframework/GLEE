Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob while still making the sale. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** Starting above Bob's perceived value ($80) creates room for negotiation.
* **Below John's Offer:** Offering it below John's guaranteed purchase price ($150) ensures Alice doesn't lose out if Bob declines.

This strategy aims to find a balance between a price Bob might consider reasonable while still securing a significant profit for Alice."
