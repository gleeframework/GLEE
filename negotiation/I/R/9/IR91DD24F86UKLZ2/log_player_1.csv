"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000.  This is a good starting point because:

* **It's ambitious:**  It aims for a good profit margin. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, I can lower the price in subsequent rounds.
* **It signals my value:**  It shows Bob I believe the product is valuable. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is a good offer, I'm going to reject it. I believe I can still get closer to my ideal price.  By rejecting, I'm showing Bob I'm serious about getting a good deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a profit. This is a good middle ground for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,200.  While I'd prefer a bit more, we're getting close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  It's important to be realistic and make a deal when it's beneficial."
