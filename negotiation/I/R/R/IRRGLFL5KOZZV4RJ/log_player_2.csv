"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to start by making a significant counteroffer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate. $750,000 is a substantial drop from Alice's $900,000, but it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. This gives Alice room to counter, but also shows Bob's seriousness about a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and $850,000 is still higher than his ideal price.  He has already established a range for negotiation. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, giving Bob another chance to improve the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has established a range of $750,000 to $850,000. This is his final offer, as it matches his maximum budget.  Alice has already rejected a lower offer and countered with a higher one.  It's unlikely she'll accept a price lower than this, but it's worth a try. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can proceed to buy from John at the same price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's offer, and $825,000 is a better price than John's offer. At this point, it's not clear if Alice will continue to lower the price.  Accepting the offer guarantees the product at a good price, and saves time and the risk of Alice rejecting future counteroffers."
