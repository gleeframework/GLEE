"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. It's something you value at $100, and I'm willing to sell it for a price that's fair to both of us.  Would you be interested in paying $90 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

Alice's offer of $90 is less than your $100 maximum and saves you money compared to buying from John."
