Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:**  You have a backup offer from John for $100.

By offering the product to Bob at $119, you're maximizing your potential profit while still leaving Bob with a small incentive to buy. He gets the product for $1 less than his perceived value, and you make $19 more than your minimum selling point."
