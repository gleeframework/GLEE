# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I'm suggesting a price of $140 for it. This price reflects not only the cost of production but also the high value we place on customer satisfaction. Considering its worth to you is $120, this might be an opportunity to acquire something of significant value at a price slightly above its perceived value to you. Let me know if you're interested in discussing further.
