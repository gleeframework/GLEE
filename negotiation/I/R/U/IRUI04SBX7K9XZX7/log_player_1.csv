"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to see if Bob is genuinely interested and willing to negotiate, while also giving myself some room to maneuver in case he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $16,000 is better than my minimum, I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing I'm willing to be flexible while still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $15,500 is getting closer to my minimum and leaves some room for profit. Since I'm nearing the middle ground, I'll accept this offer to avoid potentially risking a deal with John by continuing to negotiate."
