"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, he should aim to get it for as close to $10,000 as possible. Alice's initial offer of $11,500 is too high. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being flexible. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? "", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's minimum. This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for Alice to profit.  It also shows that Bob is serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to come down a bit. How about $11000? This is still a fair price for the value you'll get from the product, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the product for as close to $10,000 as possible. While Alice has come down a bit, $11,000 is still too high for Bob.  He should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,900, but that's my absolute limit. If you're willing to come down a little, I'm ready to close the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10900}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the price as low as possible without completely alienating Alice. He is showing a willingness to compromise while still sticking to his goal of saving as much money as possible."
