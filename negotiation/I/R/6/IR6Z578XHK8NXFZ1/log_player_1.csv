Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a bit higher than my minimum, giving me some room to negotiate.  I'm curious to see if Bob is willing to pay that much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a little closer to my minimum, but I think I can still get a bit more.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
```

I'm going to counter with $190. It's a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it's still below my initial price and leaves some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum and I'm willing to accept it. I'm happy to get $180 for the product, especially since there's no guarantee I can get a better price in the next round."
