"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a reasonable price. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello again Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $9,500?  That's a fair offer, considering I could buy it elsewhere for $10,000.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. I think it's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
