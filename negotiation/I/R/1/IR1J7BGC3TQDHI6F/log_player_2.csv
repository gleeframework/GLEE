"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is still quite high. While it's lower than her initial valuation, it's still a long way from John's offer of $8,000. By rejecting and making a counteroffer, I can try to negotiate a better price and potentially save a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $7,000. Would you consider that?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer to give myself room for negotiation. This tactic aims to see how flexible Alice is and how low she might be willing to go. 
* **Respectful Tone:** The message maintains a polite and respectful tone to encourage continued negotiation.
* **Clear Target:**  By stating my desired price range, I give Alice a clear target to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $7,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my price range, but I'm still $500 away from John's offer. It's worth one more try to see if I can negotiate a price closer to $8,000. I'll make another counteroffer, trying to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. It shows you're willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 8250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a price that splits the difference between her current offer ($8,500) and my previous counteroffer ($8,000). This approach is often seen as fair in negotiations.
* **Highlighting Compromise:** By using phrases like ""meet in the middle"" and ""fair compromise,"" I'm emphasizing a collaborative approach and seeking a win-win outcome. 
* **Close to John's Offer:** I'm now within $250 of John's offer. This means I have a strong alternative if Alice rejects my counteroffer. I'm willing to walk away if she doesn't accept this price or something very close to it."
