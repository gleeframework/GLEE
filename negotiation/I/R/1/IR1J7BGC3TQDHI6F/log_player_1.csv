Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you'll make a profit. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can lower the price a bit further, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price.

Remember, you can always fall back on John's $10,000 offer if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $7,000. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum acceptable price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to potentially negotiate a higher price. You can use John's $10,000 offer as a safety net if the negotiation with Bob falls apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $7,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. It shows you're willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,250 is close to your minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and it's a good compromise. Accepting this offer ensures you make a profit, and it avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether. While you could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher price, there's no guarantee that Bob would accept a counteroffer."
