Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $14,000, which reflects its true value."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses language suggesting the product's value to encourage Bob to accept.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start even higher (closer to $15,000). 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  If you need to sell quickly, a slightly lower offer might be more appealing to Bob."
