"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. It makes sense to negotiate a lower price, starting with a counteroffer significantly below her initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer (almost 40% lower) allows room for negotiation.  This strategy aims to determine Alice's flexibility and potential to reach a deal significantly below her initial asking price and closer to her product's value ($8,000)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice decreased her offer, but it's still above her product's value. There's room for further negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer slightly above the midpoint between our last offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250?"",
""product_price"": 7250
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show willingness to compromise:**  Moving closer to the middle ground signals to Alice that a deal is possible. 
* **Stay below Alice's product value:**  The offer is still below $8,000, aiming for a price that benefits both parties. 
* **Maintain negotiating room:** Offering $7,250 leaves space for potential adjustments while staying below the John's price of $10,000."
