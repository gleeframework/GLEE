"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering me for this product. However, $150 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, which is fair considering my value for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $130? It's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a profit. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $100. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm happy to close the deal at that price. What do you say?",100.0,Bob,4,
