"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the deal you're offering, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I'm looking for.",13000.0,Alice,3,
