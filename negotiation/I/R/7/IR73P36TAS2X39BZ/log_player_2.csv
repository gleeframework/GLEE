Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty, but $1,000,000 is still a bit shy of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the value you see in this product. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can make a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a tough one, but I think it's time to accept. Here's why:

* **Alice is firm:** Her language suggests she's unlikely to go lower. Calling it her ""final offer"" is a strong signal.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing means risking those extra rounds without guarantee of a better price. We're already below her starting point.
* **Savings are good:** $1,050,000 is still a significant discount from John's $1,500,000 price.

While there's a *chance* Alice might budge further, it's getting risky.  Better to secure a good deal now than potentially overplay our hand."
