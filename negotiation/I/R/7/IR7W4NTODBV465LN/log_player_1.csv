I'm starting high, aiming for a substantial profit.  I believe this price leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above my minimum acceptable value.  I'll carefully assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price than his initial rejection, it's still below my target. I believe there's more room for negotiation and I'm not yet willing to settle. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show willingness to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a good profit.  I believe $1,700,000 is a fair price considering the value of the product and Bob's previous offer.  We'll see if he's willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my initial counteroffer, and  it's significantly higher than what I would get from selling to John.  At this point, it's likely the best deal I can get, and I'm happy to take it.  It's time to close the deal."
