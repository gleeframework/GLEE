"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I mention that the product is worth at least $80 to me, subtly emphasizing its value.
* **Open to negotiation:** I use the phrase ""what do you think?"" to encourage Bob to counteroffer and engage in a conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to pay that much for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:** While Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum price of $80. 
* **Opportunity to increase the price:**  I believe there is still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Limited rounds:** With only 10 rounds, I can't afford to settle too early, especially with a potential buyer like John who's willing to pay $80.

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $100 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we meet in the middle at $110? This would allow both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm but flexible:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm not rejecting it outright either.  I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Focusing on fairness:** I use phrases like ""meet in the middle"" and ""good deal"" to emphasize that I'm looking for a fair outcome for both of us.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:**  $110 is still a good price for me, but there's room to go a bit lower if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $110, which would be $105. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying above the minimum:** Bob's offer of $105 is still above my minimum of $80.
* **Potential for higher price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, as Bob has already moved closer to my initial price.
* **Limited rounds:** We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiations, and I don't want to settle too early, especially considering John is willing to pay $80. 

I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $105 is getting closer, I'm still a bit off my target.  I'm willing to come down to $108.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm but showing flexibility:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm showing that I'm willing to negotiate further.  
* **Highlighting the benefit of a deal:** I emphasize that a quick deal at $108 would benefit both of us.
* **Leaving room for a final compromise:** $108 is still above my minimum, but there's still a little room to go lower if needed.

We're getting close to the middle ground, and I'm hoping this offer will convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to reach your target, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to go up to $107, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on the deal:**  Bob's offer of $107 is just $1 away from my last counteroffer.  
* **Limited rounds:** We're approaching the halfway point of our negotiations. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject this offer and continue negotiating, I risk losing Bob as a buyer entirely.  Since John is willing to pay $80,  it's safer to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale at a price significantly higher than John's offer. 

While I would have preferred a higher price, accepting this offer ensures a sale and maximizes my profit."
