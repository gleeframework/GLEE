Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium.  I'll be ready to negotiate further if he rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the $7,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm countering with $9,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.  However, it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price.  I believe this is a fair price that shows I'm willing to negotiate but also value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price. However, since John is also offering the same amount, it makes sense to sell to John. There's no guarantee Bob will accept my counteroffer, and further negotiation could waste time.  By selling to John, I secure my minimum value without any risk."
