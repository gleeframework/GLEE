"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my own valuation and the potential benefits of this product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more to you than $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,225,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,225,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and it's my maximum value. If we can agree on this, I'm ready to finalize the purchase. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,210,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1210000.0,Alice,5,
