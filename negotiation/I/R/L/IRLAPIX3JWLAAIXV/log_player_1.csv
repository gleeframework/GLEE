Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000.  This is a good starting point as it's higher than the product's value to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a higher price than what John is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the $9,500, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point with further negotiation. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm countering with $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's counteroffer and closer to my desired value. I'm hoping this will be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is the same as what John is offering.  Since I want to maximize my earnings, and there's no guarantee I can get a higher price from Bob in the next round, I'll accept Bob's offer."
