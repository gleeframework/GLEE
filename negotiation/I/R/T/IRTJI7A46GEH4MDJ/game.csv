"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,250,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still hoping for something closer to my initial price. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll gain from the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from your new offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,350,000, so I'll offer $1,300,000. Can you consider this price?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
