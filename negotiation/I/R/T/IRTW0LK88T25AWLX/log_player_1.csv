Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters, but also reflects the product's value to me.  I'm hoping to get a higher price, but I'm willing to sell to John for $10,000 if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

I'm countering with $13,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still above my minimum selling price, and I hope it's attractive enough for Bob to accept."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum selling price to John and there's a risk that if I reject Bob's offer, he might walk away, leaving me with only the $10,000 option. It's better to secure the sale at a slightly lower price than risk getting nothing."
