"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we settle on $10,250? This is the highest price I'm comfortable paying for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to sell for closer to $12,000, $10,250 is a decent price, and it's better than rejecting Bob and possibly having to sell to John for the same price. I'm hoping that by accepting this offer, I can avoid further negotiations and move on to other things."
