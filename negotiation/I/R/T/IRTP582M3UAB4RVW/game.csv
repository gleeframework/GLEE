"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product. This price is still within the range of what I believe is fair, given the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise that should satisfy both of our interests.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  However, $1,325,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try to find a solution that benefits both of us. I'm going to offer $1,275,000. This is a fair price that's in the middle of our two previous offers. What do you think?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,275,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, this time at $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
