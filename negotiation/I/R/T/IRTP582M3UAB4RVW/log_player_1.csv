Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product. This price is still within the range of what I believe is fair, given the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Let's try to find a solution that benefits both of us. I'm going to offer $1,275,000. This is a fair price that's in the middle of our two previous offers. What do you think?
