Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $11,000 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a decent profit. 
* **Positive framing:** My message is upbeat and focuses on the potential benefits for Bob, making it more likely he'll consider my offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm ready to counter with a slightly lower price, but still above my minimum acceptable amount. 
* **John as a backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage and prevents me from feeling pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
