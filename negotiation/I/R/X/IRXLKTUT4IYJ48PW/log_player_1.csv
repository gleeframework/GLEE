"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it very useful. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate and allows Bob to see that I'm serious about getting a good price. 
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport with Bob. This might make him more receptive to negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm implying that the product is valuable to Bob, which might make him more willing to pay a higher price. 

I'm confident I can get a higher price than $150 from Bob.  However, I'm also aware of my backup option with John, which allows me to be firm in my negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While I'm open to negotiation,  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **I have a better option:** Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Opportunity to counter:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round, which will hopefully lead to a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $140?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by offering a lower price than my initial offer, but still above my minimum threshold. 
* **Highlight Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is still a good deal for him at $140.
* **Emphasize Need:** I'm subtly suggesting that I need to get at least $140 to make the sale worthwhile for me. 

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between getting a fair price and keeping the negotiation open. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and accept this offer, but I'm still ready to walk away if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $140 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $130? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired $150. 
* **John is the better option:**  I know that I can secure a better price with John, making it more profitable to reject Bob's offer.
* **Opportunity for a final counter:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make one last counteroffer in the next round, potentially pushing him closer to my desired price.

By rejecting this offer, I'm maintaining my leverage and maximizing my potential earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $130 is tempting, I'm still hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and settle on $135? I'm willing to make this my final offer."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Finality:**  I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway on our last offers.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair solution for both parties.

This counteroffer is a strategic move. While it's still below my ideal price, it's a good compromise that might persuade Bob to close the deal before I have to turn to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $135. I'm willing to meet you at $125, but that's as high as I can go. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Too low:** Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited Time:** With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a satisfactory deal with Bob is high. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is a much better outcome than risking further negotiation with Bob. 

Although I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, given the time constraints and the uncertainty of further negotiation, selling to John is the most sensible option at this point. It secures my minimum desired profit and prevents further delays."
