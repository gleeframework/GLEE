"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it very useful. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me there?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $140?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $140 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $130? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $130 is tempting, I'm still hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and settle on $135? I'm willing to make this my final offer.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $135. I'm willing to meet you at $125, but that's as high as I can go. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you.",125.0,Bob,6,
