"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be of immense value to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and my current budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price.  However,  the value this product brings, especially to someone like you, is substantial.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what we're discussing.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm still interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
