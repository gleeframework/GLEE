# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $11500 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation. Bob should reject the initial offer and try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice has come down from her initial price, $11,000 is still a bit higher than Bob's ideal price. There's still room to negotiate, so he should reject the offer and try for a lower price."
