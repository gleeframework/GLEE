"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $11000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $10750?  It's a good compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal at that price.",10750.0,Bob,4,
