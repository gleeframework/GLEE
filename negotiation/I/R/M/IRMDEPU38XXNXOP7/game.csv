"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit lower than my minimum, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $105. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
