# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. Would you consider lowering the price to $1500000? I believe this might be closer to what we can agree upon.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
