"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $1,300,000, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 doesn't quite reflect the value this product brings. How about $1,600,000?

Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm getting closer to his price, $1,200,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to find a solution that works for both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business, while still allowing me to meet my financial goals.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. We're down to the wire, and while I could continue negotiating with Bob, I'm not confident we'll reach an agreement that meets my needs.  Selling to John guarantees me a price that meets my minimum requirement, and I don't want to risk losing out on that certainty."
