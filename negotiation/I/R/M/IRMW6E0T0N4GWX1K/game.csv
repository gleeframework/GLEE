"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,500 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still trying to get the price down, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for it.",10250.0,Alice,5,
