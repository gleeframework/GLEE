{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $150. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product in my message to hopefully make Bob more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking of offering $120 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low for me. I'm not willing to sell for less than $150, which is my minimum. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a good price for this product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to lower my price further.  Rather than risk further negotiation that might not lead to a profitable deal, I'll sell the product to John for $150, which is my minimum acceptable price."
