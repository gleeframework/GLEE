"I appreciate your honesty about your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product, which is the lowest I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

I'm starting to think that we might be getting close to a deal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to see some movement from your side. I'm counteroffering at $1020000.

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $1005000. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to make a profit. I'm going to make one final offer.
