"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's in great condition and worth a lot more than that, but I'm willing to make you a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price ($120).**
* **You can potentially save money by negotiating.**  You can try to get the price down closer to your maximum. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option, but not ideal.** You'd prefer to save money if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $95.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($120) and closer to your desired price.** 
* **Further negotiation is risky.** You might not be able to get a lower price, and you risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Buying from John is still an option, but you can save money by accepting Alice's offer.**"
