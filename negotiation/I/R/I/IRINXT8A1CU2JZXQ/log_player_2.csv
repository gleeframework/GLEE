"Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, you can still do better. You are willing to pay up to $120, and John is offering it for that price. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and proceeding to the next round to counteroffer is the logical choice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now offering $135, which is more than your maximum willingness to pay ($120). Since John is offering the product for your maximum price, it's more beneficial to buy from John to avoid paying more than you're comfortable with."
