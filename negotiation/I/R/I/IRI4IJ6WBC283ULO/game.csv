This price allows for some flexibility on my end while still reflecting the value of the product. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,000,000 for your product. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
