Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in.  I'm asking for $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start with a price that's slightly above what the product is worth to you.  This gives you room to negotiate down. 
* **Knowing Bob's Value:**  Since you know the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, $13,000 is a reasonable starting point.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $13,000 allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob, giving you the chance to negotiate and hopefully reach a price closer to your ideal value.
* **The Option to Sell to John:** Having John as a backup buyer at $12,000 provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob don't work out, you can confidently walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $10,000 is below my minimum value of $12,000. Accepting this offer would result in a loss for me.
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  Bob's counteroffer indicates he is willing to negotiate. I believe there's still room for a deal closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer as a Backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me confidence to continue negotiations with Bob without feeling pressured to accept his low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** My counteroffer of $11,500 is a compromise between Bob's offer of $10,000 and my desired price of $12,000. 
* **Strong Justification:** I emphasize that this price is still a great deal for Bob while also ensuring I'm getting a price closer to my minimum value.
* **Open for Further Discussion:** My message leaves the door open for further negotiation if Bob is still hesitant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is a fair compromise, meeting us halfway between my previous offer of $11,500 and his offer of $10,000.
* **Close to My Value:** While not my ideal price, $11,000 is significantly closer to my minimum value of $12,000 than Bob's initial offer.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he'll walk away, and I'll have to sell to John for $12,000, which is less than I could get now. 

Overall, accepting Bob's offer is the best course of action. It's a profitable deal for me while minimizing the risk of losing the sale."
