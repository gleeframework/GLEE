"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $120 for the product.
* Alice's offer of $110 is too high, leaving you with a profit of only $10.
* It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You can still buy from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  I'm offering a price of $95, which is a significant discount from Alice's offer of $110.
* This price is still within my budget and allows Alice to make a profit, so it's likely she'll be willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $105 is a good deal for me. It's still below my maximum price of $120 and leaves me with a profit of $15.
* While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer and I'll have to buy from John at a higher price.
* Accepting Alice's offer guarantees me the product at a reasonable price."
