Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This price is above my minimum threshold of $80, but it leaves room for potential negotiation.  I believe this is a fair starting point given that the product is worth $120 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I'll send him a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $105. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer. I believe it's a fair price, and it gives Bob a chance to close the deal while still getting a good deal."
