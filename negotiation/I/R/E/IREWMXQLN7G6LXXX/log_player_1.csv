Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm aiming for a higher price, and I'm confident I can get it with some negotiation.  Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold, so I'll reject it and try to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get closer to $1,000,000.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for you, considering its worth to you. Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but I need to stick to my budget.  Would you consider $875,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm still holding out for a better price. Bob's offer is still too low, and I have a few rounds left to negotiate.  I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you need to stay within your budget, but $875,000 is still a bit below my target.  How about $925,000? That's a good compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we settle at $900,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I'd prefer a higher price,  Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my target and is more than what John is offering.  I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether, so I'll accept his offer."
