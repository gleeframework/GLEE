"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree this product has value, I believe your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,100,000. I think this is a more reasonable compromise, considering the product's unique features and benefits.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but we're still a ways off. I can go up to $900,000 for the product. I think that's a fair offer considering it's still below your initial asking price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're still far apart, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $1,000,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
