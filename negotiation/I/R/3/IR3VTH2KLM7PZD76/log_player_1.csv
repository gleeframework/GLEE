Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product, which is still a good deal for you, considering your target price. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
