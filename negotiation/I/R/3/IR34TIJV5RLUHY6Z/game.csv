"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is still significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm not comfortable going lower than $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows you to save a substantial amount.  Let's find common ground.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,080,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,120,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you say?",1120000.0,Alice,5,
