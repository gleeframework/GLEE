{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,250,000:**  This price is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiation:** By starting at a higher price, I leave room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially earn more than Bob's perceived value but still reach a mutually acceptable agreement.
* **Backup Plan:**  I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, providing a safety net in case negotiations with Bob fail. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to counter-offer if Bob rejects my initial proposal, giving me more control over the outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Continue Negotiating:** I have the opportunity to counter-offer and potentially reach a more favorable price. 
* **Test Bob's Interest:**  Rejecting his offer shows I'm not desperate for a sale and allows me to gauge his true willingness to negotiate. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I retain control and demonstrate that I'm not willing to settle for a low price.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Rejecting the offer opens the possibility for a higher counteroffer from Bob, or a better outcome in subsequent negotiations.
* **Avoiding ""Settling"":**  I want to avoid selling at a price I consider significantly below the value of the product.  

**Next Steps:** I will counter-offer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,250,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is still significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm not comfortable going lower than $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows you to save a substantial amount.  Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $1,150,000, which is halfway between my initial offer ($1,250,000) and Bob's last offer ($1,100,000).
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal, but I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the fairness of my counteroffer. I'm also inviting further negotiation, showing I'm open to finding common ground.

**Strategy:**

* **Moving Towards Agreement:**  My counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Building Rapport:** I'm trying to maintain a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation moving forward.
* **Maintaining Control:** I'm not giving away too much ground, but I'm leaving room for Bob to reconsider and potentially accept my counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I will assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, reject it, or make another counteroffer. If I decide to reject Bob's offer, I will continue to negotiate until I reach an acceptable price or choose to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still not satisfactory.  I believe the product's worth justifies a higher price, and I'm not willing to settle for a lower value. 

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiation Advantage:** I still hold a significant advantage because I have the alternative option of selling to John for $1,500,000. 
* **Testing Bob's Limits:**  Rejecting his offer demonstrates my commitment to getting a fair price. It forces Bob to consider whether he truly wants this product at this price. 
* **Positioning for a Higher Counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I might push him to offer a more competitive price in the next round.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter-offer Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,150,000. This will show I'm willing to negotiate but I won't settle for a drastically low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,080,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,120,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1120000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $1,120,000, which is again halfway between my previous offer ($1,150,000) and Bob's last offer ($1,080,000). This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's persistence but also reiterating my position. I'm suggesting a ""fair compromise"" that benefits both parties, hoping to encourage Bob to reconsider his position.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintaining a Balanced Approach:** My counteroffer is a middle ground that keeps the negotiation moving forward without significantly compromising my position.
* **Highlighting the Benefits:** I emphasize that $1,120,000 is a win-win situation for both of us. This can make the offer more appealing to Bob.
* **Preparing for a Final Decision:** I'm getting closer to a final decision point. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will carefully consider my options.  I may choose to make one final counteroffer, or I might decide to sell to John if I believe Bob won't budge on his price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,060,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer of $1,060,000 is only $20,000 higher than his initial offer, and it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. It's clear that Bob is not willing to pay a price that reflects the product's true value.  

**Strategy:**

* **Time for a Decision:**  We have reached a stalemate. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price, and I don't want to waste more time.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me the best possible outcome.  This is a significant profit compared to Bob's offer.
* **Avoiding a Low-Value Sale:** I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product, even if it means missing out on a deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will contact John and finalize the sale of the product."
