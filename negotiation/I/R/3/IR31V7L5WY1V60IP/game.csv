"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1100000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's make this happen!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a good compromise, and it's a price I feel comfortable with. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
