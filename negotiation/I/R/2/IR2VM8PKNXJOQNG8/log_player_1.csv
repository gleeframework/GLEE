"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you.  It's worth a significant investment.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Opening with a price significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a deal well above your baseline.
* **Gauge Bob's Seriousness:**  This high initial offer will help you assess how eager Bob is to purchase.  His reaction will provide valuable information for the remaining rounds.
* **Alternative Option:**  Keeping John's offer in mind gives you leverage. If Bob's counteroffers are too low, you can always walk away and accept John's $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is substantial, we're still in the early stages of negotiation.  His message indicates strong interest, suggesting room for him to move closer to our desired price point. Rejecting his offer and proposing a counteroffer allows us to maintain the upper hand in the negotiation and strive for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  However, the value this product brings to the table is truly unique.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession ($150,000) to demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, we're still aiming for a price well above our minimum. 
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":** By framing it as a compromise, we encourage Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to our target range.
* **Maintain Leverage:** We haven't conceded too much, ensuring we retain bargaining power and keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,650,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,500,000. I'm hoping we can meet at a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Signals, But Room to Negotiate:** Bob's willingness to move to $1,500,000 and his use of phrases like ""hoping we can meet"" indicate strong interest and potential for reaching an agreement. 
* **Still Above Our Minimum:** We're still in a position to negotiate above our $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  We'll use the next round to make another calculated concession, aiming to entice Bob while maximizing our potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's make this happen. I'm willing to accept $1,575,000. I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1575000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We're reducing our concession to $75,000, signaling we're nearing our desired price point.
* **""Fair Offer"" Framing:** We're positioning this price as mutually beneficial, emphasizing fairness and value.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By suggesting we ""make this happen,"" we're subtly introducing a sense of urgency to encourage Bob towards a decision.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price point allows for one final round of potential concessions (from either side) if needed, while still securing a significant profit for us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm not quite there yet. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,525,000. I'm hoping we can get even closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Accepting Bob's offer of $1,525,000 yields a profit of $525,000, which is a significant return.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While we could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, the potential gains are getting smaller and riskier. There's no guarantee Bob will go higher.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means we receive the funds sooner, allowing us to potentially reinvest or utilize the capital elsewhere. 
* **""Close to My Budget"" Signal:** Bob's statement suggests he might be reaching his limit, making it less likely he'll significantly increase his offer.

Accepting at $1,525,000 balances risk and reward, securing a very favorable outcome in this negotiation."
