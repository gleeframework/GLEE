# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's worth a premium price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. This is a great deal, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is trying to inflate the price, claiming it's worth $15,000 to you when you've already established your maximum is less. Rejecting her offer opens the door for further negotiation or allows you to go with John for a lower price."
