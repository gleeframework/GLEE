"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high price, but one that still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for potential compromise and increases my chances of closing a deal within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is far too low for me. While I want to close a deal, I won't accept a price that significantly undervalues my product.  I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but still aiming for a price that's significantly higher than Bob's initial offer.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still protecting my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum.  Considering I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John, accepting this offer ensures I get a deal done sooner.  This also allows me to avoid potentially losing more time with further counteroffers, especially if Bob becomes less willing to negotiate."
