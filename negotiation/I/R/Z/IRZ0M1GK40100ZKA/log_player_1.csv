"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to make an offer of $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get more. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I still think $925,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $912,500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round, seeing if I can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit.  However, $912,500 is still below where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $918,750.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 918750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $918,750. I'm willing to meet you at $910,000 for the product. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original goal, the deal with Bob at $910,000 is still a good profit and securing a sale.  The risk of losing a sale and going with John at $800,000 is too high. I'll accept this offer."
