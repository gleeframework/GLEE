"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,100,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement. What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing that we're both committed to finding a mutually agreeable price. Let's split the difference - I'll accept $1,200,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I'm confident it reflects the true value. Let me know if you're ready to close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
