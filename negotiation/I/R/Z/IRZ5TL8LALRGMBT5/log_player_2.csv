Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,100,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing that we're both committed to finding a mutually agreeable price. Let's split the difference - I'll accept $1,200,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I'm confident it reflects the true value. Let me know if you're ready to close this deal.
