Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $175. Are you interested?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob.  This gives me some room to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer.  It's important to be confident in my value and not sell myself short!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I want for the product.  While it's tempting to take $120, I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price of $175."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $160?"", ""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm still holding firm on a price that's closer to my desired value, but I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price slightly.  I hope this makes Bob feel like we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk getting stuck in a long back-and-forth and potentially lose out on a sale.  It's time to move on and sell the product to John for a guaranteed $150."
