Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $19,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or concerns."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin. 
* **Value Justification:**  While the initial price is above Bob's perceived value, the message subtly emphasizes the product's inherent worth. This might make Bob more receptive, especially if he's keen on acquiring it.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message explicitly mentions openness to discussion, signaling flexibility and inviting Bob to counter-offer. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening strategy.  You might adjust your approach based on Bob's response and your understanding of his negotiation style."
