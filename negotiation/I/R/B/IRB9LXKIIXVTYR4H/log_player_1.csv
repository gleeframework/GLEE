""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be immensely valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible, but we also need to give Bob an incentive to buy.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Offering it for less would be leaving money on the table.
* **""Other interested parties"":** This creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

This offer aims to find a sweet spot where Bob makes a significant profit (buying at $1,400,000 something he values at $1,000,000) while also securing a price much higher than our guaranteed sale to John."
