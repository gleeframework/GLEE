As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and while Alice is getting closer to my desired price, I'm starting to doubt if we'll reach a deal that saves me enough money. At this point, it's likely that I won't be able to save much more with Alice. I'm going to take the secure option and buy the product from John for $1,000,000, ensuring I get the product within my budget and without further negotiation."
