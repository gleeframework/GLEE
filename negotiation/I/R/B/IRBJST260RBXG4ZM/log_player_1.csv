"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high with $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a good price.  If Bob rejects, we'll see what his counteroffer is and adjust accordingly. Remember, I can always fall back on John's $15,000 offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $20,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $18,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's counteroffer.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $16,500. This is a good price considering it's higher than John's offer and we're already on round 4.  I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower offer or having to sell to John."
