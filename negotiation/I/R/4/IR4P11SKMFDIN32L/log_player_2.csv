**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This gives me some room to negotiate and shows that I'm serious about getting a good deal.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my maximum of $15,000 but leaving some space for potential concessions."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**  While $18,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my preferred price point. I'll try to get a better deal by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

**Reasoning:**  I'm raising my counteroffer to $14,000, which is closer to Alice's offer but still below my maximum budget of $15,000.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that's within my acceptable range."
