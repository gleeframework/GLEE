"I'm really interested in the product, but $1500000 seems a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1250000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1375000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice. I'm getting close to being interested in making a deal, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd like to make a final offer of $1320000. I think this is as high as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1320000.0,Bob,6,
