"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised by offering it to you for $125, which is below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $115?",115.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but $102 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $110, which is a good compromise. I think you'll find it's worth it",110.0,Alice,5,
