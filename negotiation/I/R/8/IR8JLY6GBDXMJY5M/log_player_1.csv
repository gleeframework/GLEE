Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be just as valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Highlighting Value:** Emphasizing the product's worth to Bob helps justify the price and creates a sense of urgency.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the price as ""fair"" to establish a baseline for negotiations. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message makes it clear I'm open to negotiating, but I'm not desperate to sell at any price.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or walk away. 
* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've successfully negotiated a higher price.
* **If the negotiation stalls:** I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, guaranteeing a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering I'm confident I can leverage its potential.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate a price that's more favorable to me.
* **I'm not desperate:**  I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, so I don't need to settle for a price that's too low.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, but still leaving room for compromise. I want to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and willing to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is unfortunately not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  This counteroffer is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Focus on the benefits:**  I emphasize the benefits of the product and my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm still slightly above my minimum acceptable price, giving Bob an incentive to negotiate further.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've secured a price closer to my desired range.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to analyze his next offer and decide whether to accept it, make another counteroffer, or sell to John."
