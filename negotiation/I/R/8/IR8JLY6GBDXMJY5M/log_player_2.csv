"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be just as valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering I'm confident I can leverage its potential.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is unfortunately not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  While I could continue to negotiate, John is offering the product at my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's more efficient to buy from John to avoid further negotiations."
