"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I think $1,150,000 is a bit steep. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This seems like a fair price to me."", 
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,075,000 is a tempting offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but claiming this is her ""final offer"" this early is likely a negotiating tactic.  We still have room to negotiate and can push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of this product, but I also have a budget I need to stick to.  $1,120,000 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,090,000? That's a significant investment on my end, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1090000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close.  I appreciate you working with me on this. To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to accept $1,105,000. This is a significant discount and reflects my desire to see this product in your capable hands.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,105,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,105,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is definitely getting closer to a price we'd consider, but we're still not at our ideal point.  We'll reject this offer and try to push her down just a little bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated.  I'm also eager to finalize this and believe we can find that sweet spot. How about we settle at $1,097,500? This shows I'm serious while acknowledging the value of this product."",
