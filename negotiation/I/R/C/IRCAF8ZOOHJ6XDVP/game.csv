"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I think $1,150,000 is a bit steep. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This seems like a fair price to me.",1075000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand the value of this product, but I also have a budget I need to stick to.  $1,120,000 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,090,000? That's a significant investment on my end, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",1090000.0,Bob,4,
