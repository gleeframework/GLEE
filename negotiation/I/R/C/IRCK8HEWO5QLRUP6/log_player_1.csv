"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards and hopefully encourages Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and I still have time to negotiate.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm dropping the price slightly from my initial offer, but I'm still holding firm at a price that's within my minimum value range.  This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $14,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach our desired outcomes. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now within my acceptable range, and I'm happy to close the deal.  It's better than selling to John, and it saves me more rounds of negotiation."
