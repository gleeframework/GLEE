Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as much money as possible. Knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000, she should aim high.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Time Pressure:**  The 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Alice has a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
