"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me at that price?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $125? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to save some money. How about we meet at $115? That's as high as I'm willing to go.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to save money, but $115 just isn't working for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $120. How about we meet at $118? That's as high as I'm willing to go.",118.0,Bob,6,
