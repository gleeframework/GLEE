"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $110. I believe it would be of great value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $120 for the product. Alice's offer of $110 is better than John's offer of $120, but it's still not the best deal possible. By rejecting Alice's offer, you are signaling that you are willing to pay less. This increases the chances that Alice will lower her price to secure the sale."
