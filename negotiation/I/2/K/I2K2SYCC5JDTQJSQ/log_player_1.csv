"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation while ensuring I get a price above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $80, which is below my minimum. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering a price of $130, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, while still maintaining a profitable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a good enough price. I'm not willing to sell for that low. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to offer $125. This is just above my minimum, demonstrating I'm serious about selling but still leaving room for negotiation if Bob wants to get closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$100 is still below my minimum.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm offering my absolute minimum price of $120.  It's a final offer, and I'm ready to sell to John for that price if Bob doesn't agree.  This should hopefully encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached my absolute minimum price, and Bob is still not willing to meet it. With only two rounds left, there's not much room for further negotiation. It's better to sell to John now and guarantee the minimum profit than risk losing the deal altogether."
