"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I can meet you in the middle at $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I think we're getting close, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. I can do $10,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
