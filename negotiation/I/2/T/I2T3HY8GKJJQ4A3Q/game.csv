"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay a fair price, so how about we settle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to get closer to $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and settle at $925,000? This gives us both a good deal.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking to get a good price, and I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle ground. How about $890,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about making this deal.",890000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and $890,000 is certainly better than your previous offer. However, I still need to be closer to $950,000 to make this deal work for me. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, considering the value we both place on this product. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
