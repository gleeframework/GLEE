{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's Interest:**  I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, emphasizing the potential value he'll gain.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I'm aiming for the highest price possible, I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation alive. 

This approach balances the need to maximize profit with the need to maintain a positive relationship with Bob, keeping the door open for potential future transactions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay a fair price, so how about we settle at $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and even below my initial offer of $1,100,000.
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:** While I'm not happy with Bob's offer, I'm not ready to sell to John yet. There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob.
* **Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and signal that I'm not desperate for a sale. It also allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to get closer to $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and settle at $925,000? This gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offering Strategically:**  I'm rejecting Bob's low offer but still showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm suggesting a price halfway between my initial offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000. This shows flexibility while still protecting my minimum acceptable price.
* **Appealing to Bob's Interest:** I'm framing the offer as a ""good deal"" for both of us, emphasizing mutual benefit. 

This approach aims to keep the negotiation going while pushing for a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking to get a good price, and I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle ground. How about $890,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about making this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000

* **Negotiation Continues:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's not enough to meet my needs. However, I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can potentially get a better price.
