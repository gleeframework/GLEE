"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting price.  I'm interested in the product, but  $1,500,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  How about we bring it down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,500,000 represents the high-end of its value, $800,000 undervalues its unique capabilities.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,200,000 is closer, but it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $950,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price. $950,000 is getting closer, but I need to ensure this deal reflects the true value of the product.  Would you be willing to meet at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
