"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I can do $950,000, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price, considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still too far below what I need. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but only to $1,000,000. This price still provides you with a significant value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
