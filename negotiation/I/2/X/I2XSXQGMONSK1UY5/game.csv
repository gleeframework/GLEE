"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11000. How about we try $10750? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget.",10750.0,Bob,4,
