Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still get a better price. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price before selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11000. How about we try $10750? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal and I'm getting closer to my target.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob entirely, and I'd rather take the $10,750 than sell to John for $10,000."
