Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. I'm confident I can get at least $150 from John if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $150 is my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
```

I'm lowering the price slightly from my initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I believe this counteroffer is fair and might be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is firm on his price and I've already lowered my counteroffer.  At this point, further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a higher price. It's time to move on and sell to John to guarantee my minimum value."
