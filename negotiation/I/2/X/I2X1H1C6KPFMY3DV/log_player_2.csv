Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $120?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $75.  This product is worth a lot to me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $100? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down on her price, she's still significantly above your budget and seems to be holding firm around the $100 mark.  It's unlikely she'll go down to a price you find acceptable within the remaining rounds. You have a guaranteed option with John at $80, which is your target price."
