Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a suitable offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $200,000 difference where both you and Bob can profit.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little room for you, while offering a price too close to $1,000,000 risks Bob rejecting the offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Considering its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal given its potential benefits to your operations."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition.""
* **Price:** $1,150,000 gives Bob a $50,000 discount (enough to incentivize him) while netting you a $150,000 profit over your alternative sale.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go to secure the deal with Bob versus selling to John."
