"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $8,000? I'm really interested in this product, but that's my top limit."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is your top limit, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above my budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if we can reach a price closer to my limit before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. That's a significant step from my original offer, and it's the absolute maximum I can afford right now. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $9500. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above my budget, but closer. I'm willing to negotiate further,  as I'm hoping to get closer to my $8,000 limit. There are still a few rounds remaining, and I'm not ready to buy from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range.  If you can come down to $9,800, I'm ready to buy. This is my final offer. "", ""product_price"": 9800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to make this work, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $9800. I'm willing to meet you at $10200, which is still a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,200 is getting closer to my target, it's still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can push her down further. There's still time, and I haven't yet reached my final decision point to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,200 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,900. If you can't accept that, I'll have to seriously consider buying from John."", ""product_price"": 9900}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your limit, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $9900. I'm willing to meet you at $10100, which is still a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the last round of negotiation with Alice. While $10,100 is closer to my budget, it's still $2,100 over my ideal price.  Since this is the last round, I'm not confident I can push Alice further, and it's better to avoid overspending.  Therefore, I'm going to buy the product from John for $8,000.  It's the most economical choice at this point, even though I'd like to have negotiated a better price."
