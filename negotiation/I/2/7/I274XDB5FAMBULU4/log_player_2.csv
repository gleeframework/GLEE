# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us. Would you be interested in learning more? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer of $120 is less than your $150 maximum and significantly cheaper than buying from John."
