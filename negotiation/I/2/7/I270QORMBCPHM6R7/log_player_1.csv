I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000.  This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum of $1,000,000 from John.  

Here's my reasoning:

* **Risk/Reward:** I'm taking a calculated risk by offering a higher price.  If Bob rejects, I still get my minimum from John.  But if Bob accepts, I make a much larger profit. 
* **Potential Value:**  I don't know Bob's valuation, but I'm hoping he sees the product as even more valuable than $1,500,000. This price gives him room to negotiate if he feels it's too high.

This offer balances the need to maximize my profit with the risk of losing the sale to John."
