"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}

You're starting with a lower price to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. You're hoping she'll come down a bit."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

You are willing to pay $80 for the product from John, and Alice's offer is only $5 more. It's worth accepting her offer to save time and potentially avoid further rounds of negotiation."
