"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $7,500 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $8,200  as a final offer. This reflects the true value of the product. What do you say?",8200.0,Alice,5,
