Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,300,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.
