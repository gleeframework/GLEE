"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is better than Alice's initial valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows his absolute maximum is $8,000, so he's starting with the lowest possible offer to see if Alice is willing to budge. It's highly unlikely Alice will accept this offer on the first counter, but it sets the stage for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$11,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  There's still room to negotiate, and Bob should try to get closer to his target price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to Alice's offer, but he's still trying to get the best deal possible. This counteroffer is a compromise, showing that he's willing to negotiate but still sticking to his budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his $8,000 limit. He's only had 5 rounds, leaving 5 more to try and get a better price.  There's no need to rush into a deal that's not ideal yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, inching closer to Alice's price. He's offering $9,500, which is a compromise between his $9,000 offer and Alice's $10,000 offer. He's showing flexibility while still staying within a price range that's acceptable to him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,750 is now within Bob's budget of $8,000. While it's not the absolute lowest price, it's close enough to warrant accepting. There are only 3 rounds left, and the risk of going through more negotiation with a potential risk of Alice walking away or John's price changing outweighs the potential benefit of saving a few hundred dollars.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product within his budget."
