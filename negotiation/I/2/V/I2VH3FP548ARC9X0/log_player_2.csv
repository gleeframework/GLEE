"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth that much to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice is offering the product at your maximum price, there's no incentive to accept immediately.  There's a chance she might offer a lower price if you reject this initial offer. You're taking no risk since John is a guaranteed backup at the same price."
