Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment at $1,500,000. "", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000 and I value it at a minimum of that amount, starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation.
* **Potential for greater profit:** There's a chance Bob is willing to pay even more than $1,200,000, especially if he perceives it as highly valuable.
* **Fallback option:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can always sell to John at my minimum desired price. This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while ensuring I don't sell below my bottom line."
