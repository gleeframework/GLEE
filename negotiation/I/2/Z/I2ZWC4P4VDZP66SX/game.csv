"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  It's worth a significant amount to me, and I believe it holds immense value for you as well.  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000.  Let's discuss and see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which reflects both the value of the product and the need for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find a compromise at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I appreciate that.  $1,050,000 is getting closer to where I need to be.  However, to make this deal work for me, I'm going to need $1,075,000.  This would be a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for everyone.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 again, but I'm also willing to throw in a small additional consideration to sweeten the deal. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
