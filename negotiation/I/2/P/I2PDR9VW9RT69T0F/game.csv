"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $16,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $16,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. Would you consider that?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $14,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming a bit lower.  Could we do $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $11,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $12,000?  That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but $12,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get at least $13,000 for the product. That's my final offer. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",13000.0,Alice,7,
