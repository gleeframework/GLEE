"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the original price I was thinking of. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $11,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to go down to $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product holds for you and my original asking price.",11000.0,Alice,5,
