Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly message to build rapport and sets a price that is a good starting point, allowing for potential negotiation while still leaving room for profit.  It's important to be flexible, but also to aim for a price closer to what the product is worth to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $95. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. Would you be willing to go down to $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $100, Bob's offer of $92 is still above my minimum of $80. I'm confident I won't get a better offer from him, and I'd rather secure the sale than risk him walking away and leaving me with only the $80 offer from John."
