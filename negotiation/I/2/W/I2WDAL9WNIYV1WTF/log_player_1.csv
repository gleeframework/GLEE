Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $150 as possible, but still make the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $140 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested, but still ensures a significant profit for you.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency (""limited time"") can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer.

**Why not other prices?**

* **$150 or higher:**  Bob is unlikely to buy at a price equal to or higher than your minimum.
* **$100:** This is Bob's maximum value, leaving you with no profit. 
* **Slightly above $100:** While Bob might accept, it leaves a lot of potential profit on the table."
