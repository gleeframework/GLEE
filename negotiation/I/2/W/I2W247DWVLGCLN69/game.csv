"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $9000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you consider $7500? I'm serious about buying this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8250. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8250 is still a bit high for me. How about $8000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal quickly.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $8100. This is already a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?",8100.0,Alice,5,
