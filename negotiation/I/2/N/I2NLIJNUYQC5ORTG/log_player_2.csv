"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, considering its worth. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

You can try to get a better price from Alice.  $14,000 is still more than what the product is worth to you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $13,000?  It's a fair price considering your value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? It's a competitive price that reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still within your budget and a good deal considering you're willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product. It's a compromise, and you're saving $1,500 compared to buying from John."
