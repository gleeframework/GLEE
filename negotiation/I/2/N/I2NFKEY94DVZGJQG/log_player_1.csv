Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $12,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $12,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:**  Mentioning the product's value to Bob (which I know is $15,000) helps justify the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Ending with ""What do you think?"" makes it clear I'm open to discussing the price.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my profit:**  I'm aiming for a good profit while still being potentially agreeable to Bob.
* **Keep the negotiation going:**  A clear offer with an opening for discussion keeps the negotiation active and allows me to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my needs.  $12,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment.  How about $9,500?  I think that's a fair price, given what it's worth to me and still gives you a good profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $9,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. Selling to John would be more profitable at this point. 
* **Potential for a better counteroffer:**  While I could sell to John, I might be able to get a higher price from Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and see if I can negotiate a better deal. 

**Next Steps:** I will need to counter Bob's offer to see if I can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500. This still gives you a significant discount from my original price and leaves me with a fair profit. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm counter-offering at $10,500, which is a compromise between my original price and Bob's offer.  
* **Maintain Profitability:** This price is still above my minimum of $8,000, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Show Flexibility:** The message emphasizes my willingness to compromise and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Open the Door for Further Discussion:**  The message ends with ""Let's see if we can find a middle ground,"" encouraging Bob to counter again if he's still not satisfied."
