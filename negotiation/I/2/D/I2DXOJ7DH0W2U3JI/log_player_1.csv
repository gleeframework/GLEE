Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I am willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget considerations.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value this product will bring you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $1,050,000 represents a fair price. Let's aim for a compromise at $1,075,000. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could push for more, Bob is clearly anchored at $1,050,000 and moving up in small increments. Accepting $1,075,000 secures a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of drawn-out negotiations or losing him as a buyer."
