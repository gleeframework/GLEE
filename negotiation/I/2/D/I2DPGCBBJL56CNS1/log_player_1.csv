Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,750,000. This is a price that is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates that I am willing to be flexible while still trying to secure a profitable deal.  I am confident that I can achieve a higher price than John's offer, as Bob is likely willing to pay more to acquire the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's higher than his initial value of $1,000,000, it is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I believe I can get a better price than John's offer, as I believe Bob is willing to pay more than $1,300,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I am offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is my minimum acceptable price and I believe it is a fair offer considering the value of the product to Bob.  I am confident that I can secure this price as Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to pay more than $1,300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is simply too low. It is getting increasingly clear that we are unlikely to reach an agreement, and I'm worried that continuing the negotiation will only waste more time. I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and ensures a profitable transaction."
