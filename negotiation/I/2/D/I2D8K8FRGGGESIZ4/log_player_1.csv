Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe would be highly beneficial to you. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You have a significant advantage knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you could offer it for a price slightly above John's offer ($800,000), aiming higher allows you to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,100,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but it's unlikely he'll go below your minimum ($800,000) knowing it's a valuable asset. 
* **Confident Language:** The message uses positive and confident language to emphasize the product's value."
