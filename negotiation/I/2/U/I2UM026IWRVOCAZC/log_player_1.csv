"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,200,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but I know my product is worth more to me. I want to see if he's willing to negotiate, and this high price will make him think about it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept such a low price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price to $1,000,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows that I'm willing to compromise. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for this price, so I'm not losing anything by making this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my desired price and a good deal.  I'm accepting his offer because it's a good compromise and I'm not sure I'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds."
