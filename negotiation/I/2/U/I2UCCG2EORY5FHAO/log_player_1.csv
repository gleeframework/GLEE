Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 9500} 

This offer is based on the following reasoning:

* **My minimum:** I need to get at least $8,000, as that's what John is willing to pay.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Offering a price significantly higher than $8,000 increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer, but also significantly increases the potential reward.
* **Negotiation Room:** $9,500 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters with a lower offer.

This is a calculated risk, but I believe it gives me the best chance of maximizing my earnings while still leaving room for negotiation."
