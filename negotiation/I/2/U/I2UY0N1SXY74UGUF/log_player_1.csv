Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  By starting at $120, you get to see how Bob reacts. If he accepts, you've made a great profit. If he rejects, you can always lower the price.
* **Fallback Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, so there's no risk in aiming high with Bob."
