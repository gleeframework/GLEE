Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $10,000, opening with a higher offer (significantly above his perceived value) leaves room for negotiation and potentially reaching a price closer to your minimum. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""value"" and ""interest,"" you create a sense of demand and scarcity without revealing your guaranteed sale to John.
* **Gauging Interest:** This offer serves as a temperature check.  If Bob flat-out rejects it, you haven't lost anything and can still fall back on your deal with John. If he shows any interest or attempts to negotiate, you might be able to secure a higher price than $15,000."
