"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This allows me to gauge his interest and set the stage for negotiation. It also positions me as someone who values the product highly, which may influence his counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,300,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $1,200,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, as there's potential to reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, demonstrating flexibility while still maintaining a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value. I believe this counteroffer is more appealing to Bob while also giving me room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,500,000, especially since I can secure that amount from John.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob, hoping he'll be willing to meet my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm making a final concession here, lowering my price to $1,550,000. This is still above Bob's previous offer and closer to my desired price.  I believe this is a fair offer that Bob might be willing to accept, especially considering the possibility of selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not budging from his initial valuation, and I'm not willing to drop my price any further.  I've made several concessions and it's clear that we won't reach an agreement.  To avoid further delays and ensure I achieve my minimum price, I will sell the product to John."
