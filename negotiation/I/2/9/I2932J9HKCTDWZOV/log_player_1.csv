"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good chunk of the value Bob sees in the product. This leaves room for negotiation, but still secures a significant profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm going to try and push for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm adjusting my offer down slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it significantly higher than Bob's latest offer. I'm hoping this will show him that I'm serious about getting a good price, but also willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a good deal, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I'm going to try and push for a better price in the next round, but I'll need to be careful not to push Bob away completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $1,050,000.  This is a significant increase from his last offer, but still less than my previous offer. I hope this shows him I'm willing to compromise, but also that I still believe the product is worth more."
