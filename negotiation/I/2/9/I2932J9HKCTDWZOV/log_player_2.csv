"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's room for negotiation. We can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  We're aiming for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for her to make a profit.
* **Negotiation strategy:** Offering $950,000 is a strong starting point. It's a good compromise, and Alice has a clear incentive to accept given her $800,000 valuation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By offering $950,000, we allow for a potential counteroffer from Alice, giving us room to bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While lower than her initial offer, $1,100,000 is still more than we're willing to pay. We can likely get a better price with another counteroffer.
* **Negotiation space:** We have multiple rounds left, and Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate. This indicates that we can potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Avoiding John:** Buying from John is still our worst-case scenario. We want to avoid this outcome by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a middle ground:**  Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to our target price.  Offering $1,000,000 keeps the negotiation moving forward, but is still a good value for us.
* **Strategic increase:**  By increasing our offer slightly, we show a willingness to compromise while also putting pressure on Alice to close the deal.
* **Maintaining leverage:** We still have several rounds left, allowing us to adjust our offers if necessary.  

This strategy aims to keep Alice engaged in the negotiation and lead to a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to our target:**  $1,050,000 is only $50,000 above our last counteroffer.  
* **Limited time:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, we're running out of time to negotiate further.
* **Avoiding the worst outcome:**  Buying from John is still the least desirable option. Accepting Alice's offer ensures we secure the product at a reasonable price.

This decision balances the desire for a lower price with the need to finalize the deal before the time limit expires."
