Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $1,500,000 is a substantial sum, I believe the product's true value is significantly higher. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob before considering John's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,500,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe it undervalues the product's true potential. To meet somewhere in the middle, I propose a revised price of $1,650,000."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised proposal, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but I must respectfully decline. My maximum budget remains at $1,500,000. I am willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,550,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob is clearly very interested and edging closer to my range. I'll hold firm for now and see if I can push him a little further.  There's still room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we settle at $1,600,000? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. I am willing to consider $1,575,000 as a final offer. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,575,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is clearly very committed to acquiring the product, and his offer is now within a reasonable range. Accepting $1,575,000 provides a significant profit, and it's best to avoid pushing Bob away with further counteroffers."
