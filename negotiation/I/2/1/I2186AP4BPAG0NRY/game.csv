"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is good, $22,000 is way more than I had in mind. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  $18,000 is still pretty steep for me though.  How about $12,000? That's a fair bit closer to the middle.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still too low for me to consider.  Let's settle this at $16,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're right, we should try to wrap this up.  Your final offer is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I could do $13,000.  That's the best I can do.",13000.0,Bob,6,
