{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation, acknowledging that Bob values the product higher. It also allows for flexibility to adjust the price depending on Bob's reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $9,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to secure a deal closer to my initial offer of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something a bit closer to my initial price.  How about $9,750? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll agree it's still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,500? I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time Bob's offer is exactly the same as his previous offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial offer of $10,000,  $9,500 is a good deal considering Bob's willingness to negotiate.  Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or even a deal with John for $8,000."
