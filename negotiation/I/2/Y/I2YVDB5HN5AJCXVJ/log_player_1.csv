Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a fair price:** It's higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation, giving Bob incentive to counter.
* **It shows confidence:** Offering a price closer to your desired value demonstrates you know the product's worth.
* **It leaves room for a win-win:** If Bob accepts, you get a good price. If he counter-offers, you have space to negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also consider that a longer negotiation could risk losing Bob altogether. You always have the option to accept John's $12,000 offer if the negotiation drags on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly below your minimum desired price of $12,000. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can continue negotiating and try to reach a price closer to your goal. You'll need to counter with a price higher than $12,500 but lower than your initial $14,500, keeping in mind Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $13,500?  That still gives you a great deal on a valuable product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than your minimum desired price of $12,000 and  also higher than John's offer of $12,000. Accepting his offer will give you a decent profit while also securing the sale. It's a good outcome given the negotiation process."
