"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $1,100,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get it sold, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. By rejecting her offer, you open the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice that's closer to your range or you can simply proceed with buying from John at your target price."
