"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $115. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $100 to you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $105 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $110?  This still leaves some room for you to save, but also allows me to make a fair profit.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I was thinking more along the lines of $108. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible. Can you meet me at that price?",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $108 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $109.  This is the absolute lowest I can go, but it still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $109. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $107. I'm really interested in the product, and I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. Can you consider that?",107.0,Bob,6,
