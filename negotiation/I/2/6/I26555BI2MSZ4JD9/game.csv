"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $120. This is the lowest I can go.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $120 is still a bit outside my budget. Could you do $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering it to you for $100. This is as low as I can go.",100.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference between our last offers and call it $87.50?",87.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like your creative thinking, but I'm not sure $87.50 is quite enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $87.50, which would be $93.75. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",93.75,Alice,7,
