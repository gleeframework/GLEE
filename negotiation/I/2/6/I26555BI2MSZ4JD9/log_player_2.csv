Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $120. This is the lowest I can go.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering it to you for $100. This is as low as I can go.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference between our last offers and call it $87.50?"", ""product_price"": 87.50}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I like your creative thinking, but I'm not sure $87.50 is quite enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $87.50, which would be $93.75. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93.75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut your losses.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $90, and you have a guaranteed option at $80 with John.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point has a lower expected return."
