**Explanation:**

While you could potentially get a slightly better deal from John, it's still worth accepting Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Savings:** You'll save $25 compared to buying from John.
* **Risk:**  There's always a chance John might not have the product available, or his offer could change.
* **Time:** Dealing with Alice is likely quicker than finding and negotiating with John. 

The $25 saving outweighs the potential risk and hassle of going with John."
