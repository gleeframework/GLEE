"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than both her value and John's price. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for the product. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a price significantly lower than Alice's offer, aiming to see how much bargaining room exists. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This offer is slightly below Alice's product value ($8,000), creating an incentive for her to negotiate while still leaving me room to increase my offer if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $9,500 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Alice increased her offer from $9,000 to $9,500. This indicates she might be less flexible than initially hoped.
* **Alternative Option:** While $9,500 is closer to my maximum budget, John's offer of $12,000 is still a viable fallback. Continued negotiation is worth the risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $8,500? That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 8500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm increasing my offer to show willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's last offer and John's offer.
* **Targeting a Sweet Spot:**  $8,500 is a strong counteroffer because:
    * It's above Alice's product value ($8,000), making it likely she'll consider it seriously.
    * It leaves me with some savings compared to John's offer ($12,000). 
* **Direct and Clear:**  The message is straightforward, emphasizing the fairness of the offer and hopefully encouraging Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I still need to make a decent profit. I can do $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Progress:** We've been going back and forth, and Alice has only come down slightly from her initial offer. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better price. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We're halfway through the rounds, and continued negotiation increases the risk of reaching no agreement.
* **Acceptable Price:**  $9,000 is within my budget and represents a $3,000 saving compared to John's offer. 

While I could try to squeeze out a bit more, it's strategically safer to accept Alice's offer now and secure the product at a reasonable price."
