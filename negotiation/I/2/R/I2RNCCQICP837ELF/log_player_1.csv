``` 

While I could continue negotiating, accepting Bob's offer of $1,325,000 makes the most sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  This price is still substantially higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, netting a good profit.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to frustration or an impasse, risking the deal altogether. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Prolonging the negotiation with Bob delays the opportunity to potentially find another buyer willing to pay even more than Bob. However, the current offer is strong enough to accept now."
