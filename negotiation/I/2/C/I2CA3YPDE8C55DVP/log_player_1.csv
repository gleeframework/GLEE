Bob's offer:

Do you have any other instructions?
model:That's a good outcome! While I could have potentially gotten more by holding out for a price closer to $15,000, accepting $14,000 ensures a sale and avoids the risk of Bob walking away entirely.  I'm ready for a new negotiation whenever you are!"
