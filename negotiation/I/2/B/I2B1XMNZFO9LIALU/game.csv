"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $80 is a bit low for me. I can do $120, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",120.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I can do $110, which is still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if that works for you.",110.0,Alice,5,
