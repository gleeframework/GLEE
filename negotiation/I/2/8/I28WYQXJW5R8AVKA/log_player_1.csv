"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price, given its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for a potential compromise while maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price, aiming to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's work towards an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm willing to go to $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  While I could try to squeeze out a bit more, the risk of losing the deal and having to sell to John for the same price isn't worth it. I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
