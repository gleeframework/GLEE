"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price, given its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's above your maximum budget and you can get the same product from John for $1,500,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but still within the range where a deal is potentially possible. It shows a willingness to negotiate, but also sets a clear price point that is lower than what Alice wants. This gives Alice room to counter but also puts pressure on her to come down on her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's work towards an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your desired price point.  John is still a viable option for getting the product at a lower price. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm willing to go to $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a strong move.  It matches John's price,  demonstrating that you're serious about getting the product at a fair price.  This puts the pressure on Alice to either accept your offer or risk losing the deal to John.  If she rejects, you have a strong backup plan, but there's a good chance she'll accept and you'll get the product at your target price."
