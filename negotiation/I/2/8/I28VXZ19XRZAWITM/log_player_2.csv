"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premier product, which is valued at $1,000,000 to you. Considering its exceptional quality and unique features, I am offering it to you at a special price of $950,000. This is an exclusive opportunity to own a piece that is not only valuable but also holds significant potential for future growth in value. I am confident that this investment will meet and exceed your expectations. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly inflating the product's value to you. You know it's only worth $1,000,000 to you,  not more.
* While her offer is below your maximum, you have a better alternative: John will sell it to you for $1,000,000. 
* Rejecting Alice's offer might make her provide a counter-offer closer to her actual valuation of $800,000.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're not easily swayed by sales tactics. You're aiming to either:

* Get a better offer from Alice.
* Secure the product from John at your set maximum price."
