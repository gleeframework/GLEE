"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in the product,  $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $10000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $11500. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's a bit more than what I'd get from selling it to John. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11500 is still a little higher than I'd like to go right now.  Would you consider $11000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can offer it to you for $11250. It's a bit more than what you offered, but I think it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
