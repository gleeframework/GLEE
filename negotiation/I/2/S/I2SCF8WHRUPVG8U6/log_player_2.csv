"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,800 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $10,600?  That's a fair middle ground, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,600. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,700. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Savings:**  Alice's offer of $10,700 is a significant saving compared to buying from John for $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Limit:** Bob has been persistent in lowering the price, but Alice has also shown a willingness to compromise. Further negotiation may risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Time:** With only 5 rounds remaining, accepting this offer secures the product at a good price, minimizing the risk of missing out due to time constraints."
