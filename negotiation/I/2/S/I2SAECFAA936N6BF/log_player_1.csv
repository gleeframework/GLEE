Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, emphasizing the value he gets. This encourages him to consider accepting.
* **Alternative:** I'm keeping in mind my fallback option of selling to John for $15,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob is unreasonable. 

This approach aims to secure a favorable price while remaining open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I'd like to get closer to the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  I'm confident I can get closer to my goal by making a counteroffer. 

**Reasoning:**

* **My Goal:**  My priority is to maximize my earnings. 
* **Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price. 
* **Alternative:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is always available, which gives me bargaining power.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to get a better deal, while keeping the option to sell to John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still a bit higher on my pricing.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500 for this product.  This is a fair compromise, and it gives you a great deal for a high-quality product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm offering a compromise by moving halfway towards Bob's offer ($13,500). This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Framing:** I'm again highlighting the product's value and emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect. This aims to make the offer more appealing.
* **Reasoning:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price but willing to negotiate. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while maintaining a reasonable profit margin.

**Overall, I'm aiming to secure a price closer to my ideal while acknowledging Bob's willingness to pay a bit more than his initial offer.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $13,250. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target of $15,000, Bob's counteroffer of $13,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Considering the potential for further negotiation to take longer and potentially lead to a lower price, I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer.

**Reasoning:**

* **Time & Effort:** Continuing the negotiation might lead to a higher price, but it also risks taking more time and effort.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting the current offer ensures a relatively quick sale and secures a price that's just below my minimum.
* **Alternative:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, the risk of a prolonged negotiation could potentially lead to a lower final price. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm balancing potential profit with the certainty of a sale at a reasonably close price to my target."
