"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget, I'm ready to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to work from.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for presenting yours. While I understand your perspective, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $900,000. This offer reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I acknowledge your perspective on the value, but to be candid, I'm seeking a price closer to my original ask. I'm willing to come down to $980,000, which I believe is a significant concession and demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable price.",980000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $980,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm ready to offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to close this deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,6,
