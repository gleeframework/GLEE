Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $13,000?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $12,500, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could push further, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $13,500. It's a better deal than John's $15,000, and continuing to haggle might make me lose the opportunity for any discount."
