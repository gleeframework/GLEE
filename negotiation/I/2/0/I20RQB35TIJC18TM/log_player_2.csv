"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much as possible. Offering $1,050,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and represents a good starting point for further negotiation. It's still a profitable deal for Alice, exceeding her own valuation of the product, making it a reasonable counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is a good price for Bob considering his maximum budget is $1,200,000.  Further negotiation might result in a slightly lower price, but it's not worth the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price."
