Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, your goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 leaves some room for negotiation (if Bob wants to haggle) but still secures a significant profit margin for you.
* **Clear and Direct:** The message is straightforward, highlighting the product's value to Bob and presenting the offer confidently."
