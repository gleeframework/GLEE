"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is unfortunately below my minimum valuation for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, however. How about $1200000? It's a fair price considering the potential value this product holds.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While $1100000 is closer to my ideal price, it's still a bit below my minimum.  To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $1150000.  This is my final offer.  If you're not comfortable with that price, I'll need to explore other options.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
