"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can do better.  He has a backup option with John at $1,200,000, so he has room to negotiate with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to move forward with the deal.  Let me know if you're interested.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could try to negotiate further, $1,350,000 is a good price considering he has a backup option with John at $1,200,000.  There's no guarantee that Alice will budge further, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal with Alice altogether."
