{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $115 is higher than Bob's $100 valuation, but it gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's lower than your $120 minimum, which leaves you some room to bargain if necessary. 
* **It sets a clear expectation:**  The message makes it clear that you're confident in the value of the product, and you're willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a $100 limit. Would you be able to consider a counteroffer of $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is your minimum, Bob's offer is not enticing enough to warrant accepting. Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer that is closer to your desired price point."
