"Alice, your product is interesting, but $20,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $17,000.  Let's see if we can make this work.",17000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $17,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $19,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value.",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $19,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $17,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",17000.0,Bob,4,
