"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I believe this is a fair price given its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This initial offer is a starting point. It's high enough to hopefully entice Bob but leaves room for negotiation. I'm starting with a significant margin as I have 10 rounds and John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I believe this is a more reasonable price given the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm still confident I can get a better price from him.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $7,500 is significantly lower than my minimum expectation. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go lower than $9,000.  This still gives you a good deal, and I believe we can finalize this in a mutually beneficial way. "", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit higher than $9,000, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is better than John's offer of $8,000. It's time to close the deal."
