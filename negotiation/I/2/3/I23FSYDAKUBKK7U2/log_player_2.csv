"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay $100 for the product, and Alice is offering it at $100, you're essentially indifferent between buying from Alice and buying from John. However, you want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility that she might lower her price to secure the sale."
