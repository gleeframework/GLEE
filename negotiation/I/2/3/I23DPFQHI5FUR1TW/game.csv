"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant benefits it offers.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that starting price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but the gap is still pretty wide for me. To move things along, how about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this deal, and I appreciate that. While $800,000 is close to my minimum, I'm willing to accept that price if we can agree to one additional term.  Perhaps there's a service or piece of information I could include that would add value to the deal for you?",800000.0,Alice,5,
