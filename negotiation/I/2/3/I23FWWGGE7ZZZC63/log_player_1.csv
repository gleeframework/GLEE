Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

This offer gives you a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation but ensuring you get a price significantly above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $1300000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I can afford right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer.  Rejecting gives you the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,300,000 is too far below my asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,350,000? That's still a great deal for you, and allows me to get closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
