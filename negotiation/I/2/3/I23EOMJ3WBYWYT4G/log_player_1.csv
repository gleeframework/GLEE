You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $15,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,750. Can you consider that?

Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

``` 
At this point, Bob's offer of $14,000 is only $1,000 less than your minimum desired price of $15,000.  Selling to John would net you the same amount, but there is a chance that Bob will accept a slightly higher counteroffer.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures the sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
