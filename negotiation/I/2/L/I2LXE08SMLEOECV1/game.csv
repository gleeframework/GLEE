"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 was a bit too high for you, but I still think $130 is a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell it to you for $155.",155.0,Alice,3,,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,150.0
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $142.50, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $155 and $142.50. Let's settle on $148.75. I think it's a fair price for both of us.",148.75,Alice,5,,
