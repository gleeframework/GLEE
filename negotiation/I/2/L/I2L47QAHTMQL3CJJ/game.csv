"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $600,000 is significantly below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price.  $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's value.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $725,000 is closer to my desired price, I still need to make a profit on this.  I'm willing to go down to $800,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",800000.0,Alice,5,
