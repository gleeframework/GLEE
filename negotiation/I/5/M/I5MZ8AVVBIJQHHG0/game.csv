"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value,  $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, reflecting its worth while still being within my financial limits. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has immense value that extends beyond your initial assessment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This demonstrates my commitment to acquiring the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
