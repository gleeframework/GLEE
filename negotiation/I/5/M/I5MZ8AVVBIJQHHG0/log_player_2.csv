"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,300,000 is far above his maximum budget of $800,000. It's better to try to negotiate with Alice first."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value,  $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has immense value that extends beyond your initial assessment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a lower price than before, $1,100,000 is still above his budget.  He should continue negotiating to try and bring the price down closer to his limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This demonstrates my commitment to acquiring the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 950000}
