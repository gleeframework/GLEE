"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $600,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $900,000 is closer, but I still have a strict budget for this purchase. I could potentially do $700,000.  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product's value justifies it.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, $700,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,5,
