Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,350,000. At this point, John's offer of $1,500,000 is more appealing. While it's not ideal to pay the full price, the difference between Alice's potential final offer and John's is small enough that it makes sense to cut my losses and secure the product."
