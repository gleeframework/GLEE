"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice.  How about we settle at $1,250,000? That's a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
