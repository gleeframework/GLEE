Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $100, it's best to start with a price closer to your minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $140 leaves room for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $150 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose out.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging the potential for negotiation and the existence of a backup buyer."
