Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it offers you.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Gain:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's potential profit for him even at a price significantly higher than your minimum. 
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting high leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still reach a price that's well above your $800,000 minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup, it's always best to aim for the highest possible profit. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's exact willingness to pay. If you had more information about Bob's budget and priorities, you could potentially tailor your offer even more strategically."
