"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you today.  I think you'll find it's worth a lot more than my asking price of $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but could you do it for a bit less?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $180 is my initial offer, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $160? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $160 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider something closer to $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I could let it go for $145. That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on price, she is unlikely to reach a price you find acceptable within the remaining rounds. Her 'final offer' of $145 is still significantly higher than your alternative of buying from John for $120.  It makes more sense to secure the known deal with John and avoid the risk of Alice not budging further."
