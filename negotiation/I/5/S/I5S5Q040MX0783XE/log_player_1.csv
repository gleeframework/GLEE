Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd find really useful. I'm asking for $120 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still below the value to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Openness to negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to work with Bob to find a price we both agree on. This encourages him to counteroffer rather than walking away. 
* **Value proposition:** I'm hinting at the product's value to Bob, making him more likely to want to buy it. 

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while also keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum desired price of $80.
* **Opportunity to improve:** I believe I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Bob is clearly interested in the product, giving me a good opportunity to negotiate a better price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm continuing the negotiation process and aiming to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $90 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, showing flexibility while still getting closer to my desired price.
* **Emphasize value for both sides:** I'm framing the offer as a ""good deal"" for both of us, aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Maintain open communication:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $95 is only $5 below my minimum desired price of $80.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob will walk away completely, leaving me with only the $80 offer from John.
* **Time is a factor:** Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a higher price, but it also risks losing Bob as a buyer altogether.

Given these factors, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most logical choice to maximize my earnings while minimizing risk."
