Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it's worth a great deal, but I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have a safety net. Offering the product to Bob at a higher price allows you to potentially gain an extra $5,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting high gives you room to negotiate if Bob counters. He might be willing to pay slightly more than $10,000, even if he rejects the initial $15,000 offer. 
* **Psychology:** A higher initial offer can sometimes make the buyer perceive the product as more valuable. 
 
**Important Note:**  There's always a risk that Bob will reject the offer, and you'll have to settle for the $10,000 from John. However, the potential for a higher profit makes this a calculated risk worth taking."
