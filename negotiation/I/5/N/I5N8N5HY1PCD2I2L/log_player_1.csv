"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This gives me a good starting point to maximize my profit while still being potentially attractive to Bob.  I'm hoping to get a good deal close to my ideal price, but I'm also aware I can always fall back on John's offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to accept it right away. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm lowering my price to $16,500.  This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a profit.  It's a decent compromise that keeps us both close to our desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is getting a bit close to my minimum acceptable price and we are nearing the halfway point of our negotiations. While I would prefer a higher price, $15,500 is a solid offer and I don't want to risk losing the deal."
