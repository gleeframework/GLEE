"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds significant value. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.  While I cannot disclose the exact details of the product's worth, I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This represents a potential gain for you, as I know the product is worth no less than $800000 to me.  I understand you may have questions, and I'm happy to discuss further. Please let me know if you're interested in exploring this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is offering the product for $900,000, which is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. Even if the product's actual value is only $800,000 to Alice (as she claims), you still stand to make a profit of $100,000 by accepting her offer. 

Therefore, it's in your best interest to accept Alice's offer and save $600,000 compared to buying from John."
