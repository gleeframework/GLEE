Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I would accept from John, hoping to leverage Bob's interest. This leaves room for negotiation and hopefully allows me to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a compromise, but still closer to my desired price. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm starting to feel like the negotiation is getting drawn out.  John is a guaranteed sale for a price that's still above my minimum, so I'm going to take the safe bet and sell to John."
