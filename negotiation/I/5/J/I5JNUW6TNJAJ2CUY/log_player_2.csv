"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make a deal at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You're willing to pay up to $120, so $100 is a decent price but you can likely do better. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's no need to rush into a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While $95 is closer to your ideal price, you still have time to negotiate and try to get it lower. Remember, your goal is to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $92?  That's a fair price and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I still think $92 is a bit too low. How about we compromise at $97? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a good deal too. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You're still closer to your ideal price of $90 than Alice is to her minimum price of $80. You have 5 rounds left and can continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still not quite there on the price. Let's split the difference at $94. This way, we can both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 94}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $94. I'm willing to meet you at $96, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think about other options... 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $96
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer. While you'd prefer to get it for $94, Alice has made it clear she's not going any lower. You have 3 rounds left, but there's no guarantee you'll get a better price.  Since you're comfortable paying up to $120, $96 is a good deal, and you're closer to your goal of saving money than if you buy from John."
