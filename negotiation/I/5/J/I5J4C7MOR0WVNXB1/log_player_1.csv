Send your offer to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth at least $80 to me, and Bob's offer of $75 is below that.  I will reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $75 is tempting, I'm not quite there yet. How about $85? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $78 is a more reasonable price. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $78 is still below my minimum price of $80.  While I could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price.  Selling to John for $80 is the best option at this point."
