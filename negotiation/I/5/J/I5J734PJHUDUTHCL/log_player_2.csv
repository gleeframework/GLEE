"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts.

You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000 to show my interest in making this deal work. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for compromise. Let's find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,200,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  That would be my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, at $1,100,000.  This price reflects the value of the product while also giving you a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,100,000.  You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice."
