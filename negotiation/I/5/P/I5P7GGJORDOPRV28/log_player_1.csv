"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product can be very valuable for your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value to give myself room to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product for Bob, making it more appealing to him.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it can bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000).** 
* **I have 9 rounds remaining, giving me enough room to negotiate further.** 
* **While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.** 

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I need. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's still a good deal for you considering its potential benefits."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards Agreement:** I'm counteroffering with a price lower than my initial asking price but still above my minimum acceptable value. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value and its potential benefits for Bob to further justify the price.
* **Creating Urgency:** By highlighting the true value, I'm subtly suggesting that this might be the last opportunity to secure the product at a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $950,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it can bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** While Bob has shown some willingness to compromise, there's still room for further negotiation. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I still believe there's a chance to get closer to my desired price or even secure a deal for $1,000,000 in the remaining rounds.

I'll counteroffer Bob again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and its potential for your business. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable investment for you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This is my final counteroffer, as it's my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Emphasizing Value & Fairness:**  I reiterate the product's value and how this price is fair for both of us.
* **Creating Urgency:**  I'm not explicitly saying this is my final offer, but the phrasing (""to bridge the gap"") suggests I'm trying to reach a deal quickly. 

**Note:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely move to selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it can bring to my business, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We are now in round 6, with only 4 rounds left.  
* **Bob's Offers Are Unacceptable:** Bob's offer of $920,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **John's Offer is Guaranteed:**  While negotiating with Bob further is possible, it risks reaching the end of the rounds without a deal. John is a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is more than what I'm currently getting from Bob.

Given the limited time and the certainty of John's offer, it's more strategically sound to sell to John at this point."
