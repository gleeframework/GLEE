"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her own valuation, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to his maximum budget as possible.  Offering $900,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and is a strong starting point for negotiation. This counteroffer leaves room for potential compromise while still being within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it is still above Bob's maximum budget.  Continuing to negotiate is the best course of action.  There is still room for Alice to lower her price, and Bob might be able to get a better deal.  The risk of going to John now is that he might raise his price if Bob returns to him later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of offering a price closer to his maximum budget.  Increasing his offer to $950,000 shows he is willing to compromise, but still leaves room for negotiation. This is a  strategic move to potentially reach a deal in this round, avoiding the risk of going to John or potentially waiting for another round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he can get from John. There are only 5 rounds remaining, so it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice may be willing to lower her price further to avoid going to John, especially as she is already at a price significantly lower than her valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now at his maximum budget, so he is offering the highest price he is willing to pay.  This is a high-risk, high-reward move. If Alice accepts, Bob gets the product for his maximum price. If Alice rejects, Bob can still go to John and get the product for the same price.  He has nothing further to lose by making this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget, and there are only 3 rounds left.  At this point, it's more advantageous to go with John.  The risk of continuing to negotiate is that Bob may not be able to reach a deal within the remaining rounds, and he would be left with nothing. Buying from John guarantees the product for his maximum budget, ensuring a successful purchase."
