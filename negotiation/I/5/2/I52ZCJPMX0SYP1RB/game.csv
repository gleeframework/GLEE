"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time.  I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000, which is closer to the value I see in the product.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
