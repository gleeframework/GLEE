"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I'm offering for sale. I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to build rapport with Bob.
* **Value proposition:** I'm hinting at the product's value to Bob, even without revealing details. This is to pique his interest. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The wording ""What do you think?"" implies I'm open to discussion and potential adjustments. 

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's interest and create a starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $100 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell. I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more.  By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:**  It shows Bob I'm not willing to settle for his first counteroffer. 
* **Explore higher offers:**  Perhaps he'll increase his bid in the next round to avoid losing the deal. 

I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial ask of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. $75 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $85?  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledgement:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and showing I'm still interested.
* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by moving closer to his offer, but not fully accepting it. This shows flexibility while still maintaining leverage.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation going. 
* **Finality:**  I'm suggesting a compromise that should be agreeable for both parties. 

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between getting a better price and maintaining a friendly negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $85 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $80?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely.  Considering:

* **Time constraint:**  I only have 10 rounds to close the deal.
* **John's offer:** I can always sell to John for the same price if the negotiation fails.

Accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic choice. It guarantees a sale at my minimum price and avoids the risk of losing the deal."
