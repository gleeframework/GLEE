Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

This offer leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a price higher than my minimum.  I'm aiming to get as close to Bob's value as possible without risking him walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer, but still leaving room for further negotiation. I'm hoping this will be a more attractive price for him while still leaving me a decent profit."
