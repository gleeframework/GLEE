"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, potentially getting closer to his desired $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to his maximum budget of $8,000 as possible. Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's serious intent to purchase, but still leaves some room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his maximum limit.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating with Alice, potentially pushing the price even lower.  He has the option to buy from John for $8,000 if negotiations with Alice fail.  This keeps Bob in a position of power."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to split the difference between his desired price of $8,000 and Alice's current offer of $9,000. Offering $8,750 demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still being within a reasonable range for Bob. This counteroffer could potentially be accepted by Alice, especially if she's motivated to make a sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,900 is still above Bob's budget, but only slightly. However, Bob has already gone through several rounds of negotiation and has reached a point where further counteroffers may not lead to a better price. 

Given the risk of a prolonged negotiation, Bob decides to opt for the certainty of buying from John for $8,000. While this is not the lowest possible price, it guarantees Bob achieves his goal of acquiring the product within his budget."
