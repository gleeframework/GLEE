Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm asking for $19,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My primary goal is to get the highest price possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, I want to see if Bob will pay a premium. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** A starting price of $19,000 represents a significant markup from my minimum, but it's not so high that it would immediately scare Bob away. It leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **Positive Language:**  The message focuses on value and opportunity rather than just stating a price. This framing can make Bob more receptive. 
 
**Important Note:** I am aware that if Bob rejects this initial offer, I can always propose a lower price, eventually going down to $15,000 if necessary."
