"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $11000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer it to you for $10800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, Alice, but $10800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10200 for the product. I think that's a fair price, considering the product's value to me. I'm getting close to my budget, and I'd like to see if we can meet on this price.",10200.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $10800 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me. I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $10500. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. I think that's a fair price, considering the product's value to me and the fact that I've already made a serious offer. I'd like to see if we can meet on this price.",10000.0,Bob,8,
