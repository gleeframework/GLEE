Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Offering a price of $10,000 will help gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, great! If he negotiates, we have room to come down while still making a profit.
* **Backup Plan:**  We have a guaranteed sale with John at $8,000, so there's no risk of losing money. This allows us to be a bit bolder with our initial offer to Bob."
