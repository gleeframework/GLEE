Considering its exceptional quality and unique features, I am extending this exclusive opportunity to you at an attractive price of $9,500. This is a special offer tailored to recognize your interest and commitment. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or sticking with your backup plan of buying from John."
