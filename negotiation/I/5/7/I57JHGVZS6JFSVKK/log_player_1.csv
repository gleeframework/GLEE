{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $145. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $145 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have a guaranteed buyer in John, maximizing your profit is the priority.  

**This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale and maximizing your potential earnings.**"
