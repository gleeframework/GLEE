Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product and understand its worth to our business.

Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. We appreciate your flexibility. Considering our financial situation, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850000. This price is higher than our initial proposal but remains within our budget constraints while still allowing us to benefit from the product's value.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a slightly higher price, it's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  $850,000 is still a good price and allows me to secure a sale without jeopardizing my minimum goal."
