"I'm excited to offer you this valuable product, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay $10,500, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still not quite there at $12,500.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,500? It's a fair price for both of us and gets this deal done.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about getting this deal done, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the split-the-difference approach, but I'd like to add a bit more to my end. I'll counter with a price of $13,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering our previous discussions, I'm confident we can find a middle ground. I'll offer $12,000. Let's make this happen!",12000.0,Bob,6,
