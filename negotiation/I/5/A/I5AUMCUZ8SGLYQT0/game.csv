"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save some money if possible.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm motivated to sell, $120 is too low for me. Could you do $170?",170.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $170 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $155. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Bob,4,
