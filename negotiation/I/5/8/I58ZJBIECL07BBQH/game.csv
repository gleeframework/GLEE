"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $14000. Would you be willing to consider that?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still quite attached to this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $16500? It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $15750? This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to my budget and still leaves you with a fair profit.",15750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm not quite ready to give up on my original target price. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to accept $16250. It's a small concession, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",16250.0,Alice,5,
