# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1150000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. Let me know your thoughts.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation to potentially get a better price. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to come down further before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. However,  $1050000 is quite a bit below what I'm looking to get for the product.  Considering its value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This price reflects the unique benefits you'll gain from this product.  I'm confident this is a fair offer for both of us. Let's see if we can make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still lower than what John is offering but it's a significant improvement from her previous offer.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice walking away or John changing his price makes accepting her offer the most prudent choice at this point."
