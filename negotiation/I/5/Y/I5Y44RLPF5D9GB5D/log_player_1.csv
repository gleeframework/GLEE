Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $12,000.  It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $9,000 is still below my minimum, and I have more rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10,500? That's still a great price for a product worth so much to you. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm tempted by the $9,500 offer, I'm still not close enough to my minimum of $8,000. I have more rounds left, and I think I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both trying to find a compromise.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value to you, while still allowing me to make a profit. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the effort to find a compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target price. How about $9,750? That's the best I can do, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,750 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can push for a better price. I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $10,000 yet. I have more rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,750 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can't go lower than $9,900. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9900}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500, and that's as low as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm running out of rounds, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  I'm better off selling to John and guaranteeing myself a profit. It's disappointing not to get a higher price, but it's the most sensible option at this point."
