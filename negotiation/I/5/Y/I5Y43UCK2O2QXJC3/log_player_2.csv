"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth no more than $150 to Bob, and Alice's initial offer is significantly lower. It's a good starting point to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to come up in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the initial price, but I'm looking to spend closer to $75.  Let me know if you're willing to come down a bit."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $82.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his target of $75. It's worth continuing the negotiation and seeing if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $82.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $78. How about we split the difference and settle at $80?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $80, but I'd like to add a small premium for the value this product brings. I'll offer you $81.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $81.50 is very close to Bob's target of $80, and it's still a significant savings compared to buying from John at $150.  It's a good deal for Bob, considering he's already had several rounds of negotiation. Continuing to haggle might risk losing the deal altogether."
