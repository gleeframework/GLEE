"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's value of $800,000. This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $950,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000, but still a considerable profit for Alice, as her value for the product is $800,000.  This counteroffer is a good starting point for further negotiation. It shows Bob is serious about purchasing the product, but is also trying to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer of $1,100,000. Here's why:

* **Still room for negotiation:**  While $1,100,000 is better than Alice's previous offer, there is still a considerable gap between Alice's value ($800,000) and the current offer. This indicates there's potential for further negotiation to get a lower price.
* **Avoiding unnecessary risk:** Accepting the offer would mean paying more than Bob needs to.  Rejecting the offer gives him another chance to try and secure a lower price, which aligns with his goal of saving as much money as possible. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By continuing to negotiate, Bob shows Alice that he's not desperate and is willing to walk away if he doesn't get a good price. This can put pressure on Alice to lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $1,000,000. This is a slight increase from his previous offer of $950,000, showing he's willing to compromise. However, it's still significantly lower than Alice's current offer of $1,100,000. This demonstrates Bob's commitment to getting a good price while leaving room for further negotiation."
