Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This leaves a good amount of room for negotiation while still ensuring I get significantly more than my minimum price. I'm confident Bob will be interested since he values the product at $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is more than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,100,000. This is a compromise, but it still gives me a good profit while acknowledging Bob's desire for a lower price. I'm hopeful that this will be acceptable to him."

```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a bit more, $1,000,000 is still a good profit and a significant improvement over selling to John.  Further negotiation might not yield a better price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
