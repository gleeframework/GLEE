,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,600,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it can bring you a significant return on your investment. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,700,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm still interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
