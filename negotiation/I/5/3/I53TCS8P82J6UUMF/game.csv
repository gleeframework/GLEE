"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I can comfortably afford right now. I'd be willing to pay $10,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. How about we split the difference at $11,000? This gives you a good deal on the product and allows me to move forward.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you being flexible. While $11,000 is closer, I'm still a bit stretched.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground. How about we meet at $10,750?  This would be a great deal for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
