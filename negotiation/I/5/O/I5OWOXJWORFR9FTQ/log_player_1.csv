Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,500,000 (because John guarantees that price).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There is no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum. Any deal will rely on you getting close to your minimum.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price, you hold a strong position.  However, it's always better to try and get more if possible. Here's a strategy:

1. **Start High:**  Begin with an offer above your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he brings the price down.
2. **Be Confident:**  You have a backup offer, so project confidence in your product's value.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm offering it at $1,700,000."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** The $1,700,000 price gives you negotiating room while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Focus on Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential,"" subtly suggesting it might be worth even more than Bob's initial assessment.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Response:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or reject your initial price.  You can then decide whether to negotiate further or accept John's offer.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a positive relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly less aggressive opening price. However, remember your bottom line."
