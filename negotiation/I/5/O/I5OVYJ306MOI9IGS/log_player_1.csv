**Reasoning:**

Bob is firmly rooted at $1,200,000 and has now threatened to walk away. While we could continue negotiating, it's risky.  Here's why accepting is the best move:

* **Profitable:** $1,200,000 is a significant profit above our minimum ($1,000,000). 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing pushes Bob closer to walking away. We risk getting stuck with John's lower offer.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations and secures the profit."
