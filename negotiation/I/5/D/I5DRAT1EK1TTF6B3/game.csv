"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 is a bit high for you. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",130.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm going to counter with $125. Is that something you'd be interested in?",125.0,Alice,5,
