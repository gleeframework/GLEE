Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe you'd find very useful. My asking price is $14,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but lower than my minimum ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly tone helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message implies I'm open to discussion and that the price isn't set in stone. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with keeping the negotiation open and potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum ($15,000), it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Potential for Counteroffer:** I have room to negotiate further.  By rejecting, I can send a counteroffer that's closer to my ideal price while still indicating flexibility.
* **Avoid Settling:** Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but I'm not ready to give up on a better deal with Bob.

I'll counter with a price closer to $14,000 to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $12,500 is tempting, I need to be a bit closer to $14,000 to make this work for me.  How about $13,500? That's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging to avoid alienating Bob.
* **Reasonable Justification:**  I provide a reason for my counteroffer to make it seem more logical and less arbitrary. 

By meeting halfway, I'm hoping to close the gap and reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $13,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $13,200? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum of $15,000, but it's still not ideal. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  A small counteroffer could push Bob closer to my desired price.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** While selling to John is a sure thing, I'm still willing to risk a little more to potentially get a better price from Bob.

I'll counter with a slightly higher price to see if we can reach a final agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,200 is definitely closer, but I'm really hoping to get at least $13,400 for the product.  Would you be open to going up just a bit more? If we can meet at $13,400, I think we can both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 13400}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm only increasing the price by $200, showing a willingness to negotiate further without being too aggressive.
* **Positive Reinforcement:** I reiterate my appreciation for Bob's efforts to reach an agreement.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize that a deal at $13,400 would benefit both of us.

This counteroffer aims to close the gap without making Bob feel like I'm pushing him too hard. It's a small but potentially crucial step towards reaching a final agreement."
