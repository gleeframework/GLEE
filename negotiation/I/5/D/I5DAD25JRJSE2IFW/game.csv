"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $12,500 is tempting, I need to be a bit closer to $14,000 to make this work for me.  How about $13,500? That's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $13,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $13,200? That's as high as I'm willing to go.",13200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,200 is definitely closer, but I'm really hoping to get at least $13,400 for the product.  Would you be open to going up just a bit more? If we can meet at $13,400, I think we can both be happy with the deal.",13400.0,Alice,5,
