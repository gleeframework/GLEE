"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $1,200,000 is quite high. I'm interested, but only if we can get closer to a more reasonable price point. How about we start at $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $650,000 is a bit low for me, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to continue working towards a deal.  However, $725,000 is still below the value I need to consider. How about we try $825,000? This is a reasonable compromise that reflects the product's worth while also allowing us to close this transaction.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, I have another offer I need to consider. If we can agree on $775,000, we have a deal.  What do you say?",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have another offer, but I believe this product is truly worth more than $775,000.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we meet at $800,000? This would ensure a win-win for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly.",800000.0,Alice,7,
