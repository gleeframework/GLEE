{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and your desired sale price. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be happy. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This price is closer to what I can afford while still recognizing the value of the product to you. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise.  He's still aiming for a lower price, but acknowledges the value of the product to Alice. By proposing a middle ground, he hopes to encourage Alice to accept his offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $875,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $890,000. This price acknowledges the value you place on the product while also allowing me to make a fair profit.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is getting closer to Bob's target price of $850,000.  While there is still room for negotiation, accepting the offer saves time and ensures a deal is closed. If Bob rejects the offer and continues to negotiate, there is a risk that Alice will walk away or the negotiation will drag on without a resolution.  Additionally, if Bob rejects the offer, he may end up paying more in the end if Alice counters with a higher price or if Bob eventually decides to buy from John at $1,000,000."
