"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob gets from the product, which might encourage him to accept. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm keeping the door open to negotiation by asking for his thoughts. 

This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and set the stage for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, it doesn't give me any profit. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob, especially since the product is worth $120 to him. 
* **Exploring potential gains:** By rejecting his offer, I can try to get closer to my desired price.

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $80 is simply too low for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $90. This still leaves you with a substantial profit, and it's a fair price for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's. This shows I'm flexible and willing to find a solution.
* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:** I'm reiterating the value Bob gets at this price and highlighting the fact that it's still a good deal for me.
* **Open to dialogue:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion and negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $85 is close to my minimum, I'm still only making a small profit.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Given that Bob values the product at $120, I believe there's still a possibility of getting closer to my desired price.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer keeps me in a position of strength and allows me to continue negotiating.

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get a price slightly higher than $85."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $87.50? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining a balance:**  I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows I'm committed to reaching an agreement.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair price for both of us, which can be persuasive to Bob.
* **Encouraging a resolution:**  I'm stressing the importance of finding a solution that works for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $82.50. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While $82.50 is getting close to my minimum, it's still a bit higher than what John is offering. I want to see if I can get closer to $85.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate. There's still potential for a better deal.
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm still in a position of strength, as I have a backup buyer in John.

I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to $85."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $82.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $83.75? That's a fair compromise and would allow us to reach a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 83.75} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This demonstrates a willingness to find common ground and compromise.
* **Framing it as a solution:** I'm highlighting the fact that this price allows us to ""reach a deal,"" suggesting a positive outcome for both parties.
* **Maintaining a slight advantage:** While $83.75 is closer to Bob's offer, it still gives me a slightly higher profit than what John is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No further room for negotiation:** Bob has returned to his original offer of $80, which is my minimum. There's no further room for negotiation to gain a higher price.
* **Time is running out:**  We are in round 8, and I only have two rounds left. I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.
* **John's offer is secure:**  John is a guaranteed buyer for $80, providing a reliable alternative.

Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit, and it's a safer bet than risking further negotiation with Bob."
