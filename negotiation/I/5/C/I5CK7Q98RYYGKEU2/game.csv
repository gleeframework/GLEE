"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000. This would be a good deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the value I place on the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $950,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to be flexible, but my minimum price is $1,200,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that considers both of our needs and allows us to reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm seeing your willingness to compromise here, and I respect that. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. How about $1,050,000? This is a significant move on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer considering my budget constraints.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your efforts, but $1,050,000 is still too low.  To make this deal work for me, I need to be at least $1,150,000. Let's find a middle ground at $1,175,000. This would be a mutually beneficial agreement that allows us to close this deal.",1175000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I'm prepared to offer you $1,100,000.  I believe this is a very competitive offer, and it would allow us to finalize this deal today.",1100000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering $1,125,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows us to finalize this deal.",1125000.0,Alice,9,
