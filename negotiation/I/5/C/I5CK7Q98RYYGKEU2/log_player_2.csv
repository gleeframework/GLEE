It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Alice has been very slowly lowering her price.  It's unlikely she'll drop below $1,100,000 in the last round. 
* **John's Price is Solid:** You're guaranteed the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Any further negotiation with Alice risks getting you a price higher than that.
* **Time Value:** Each round represents time and effort.  John's deal is available now.

While there's a slight chance of getting the product for a bit less from Alice, the risk outweighs the potential reward at this point."
