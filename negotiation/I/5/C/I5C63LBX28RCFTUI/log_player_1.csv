"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than Bob. I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum price of $100 as possible.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? I'm willing to be flexible to make this work."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92. Can we meet at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position. Let's try $93. It's a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 93}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I really like the product. I'm willing to meet you at $91. Can we do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $91 is tempting, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to counteroffer one more time to see if we can reach an agreement.  If he rejects, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm going to have to be firm on this one. $91 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $92, which is the best I can do.  If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your honesty, but I'm still not comfortable with $92. I'm willing to meet you at $90.5. It's the best I can do, and I'm starting to lose interest if we can't meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $90.5 is still below my minimum. With only two rounds left, I'm not confident that I can get him to go any higher. It's better to sell to John at $100 to ensure I get my minimum price."
