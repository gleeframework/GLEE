"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? I'm willing to be flexible to make this work.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92. Can we meet at that price?",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position. Let's try $93. It's a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the deal.",93.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to walking away, but I really like the product. I'm willing to meet you at $91. Can we do that?",91.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm going to have to be firm on this one. $91 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $92, which is the best I can do.  If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",92.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm still not comfortable with $92. I'm willing to meet you at $90.5. It's the best I can do, and I'm starting to lose interest if we can't meet in the middle.",90.5,Bob,8,
