Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000,  getting Bob to buy it allows us to potentially make an extra $150,000. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation:
    *  Bob gets the product for $150,000 less than its value to him.
    *  Alice makes $150,000 more than selling it to John.
* **Exclusivity:**  By framing the offer as ""exclusive,"" we aim to entice Bob and make him feel like he's getting a special deal."
