"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to buy the product from John for a lower price of $1,000,000."
