"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point, but $1,650,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000, which is a fair compromise given the value we both see in this product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $1,400,000 is a significant sum, I still believe the product holds more value. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll need Bob to show more flexibility as well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're both serious about getting this deal done. I'm willing to consider a significant drop if you're willing to meet me closer to my previous offer. How about $1,550,000? This reflects my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,500,000.  This is a fair price that respects both our needs and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  $1,500,000 is a strong offer. It represents a significant profit above my minimum, and continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob walking away.  This feels like a good point to settle."
