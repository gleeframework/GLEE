"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  To kick things off, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,800,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,650,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high.  Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating to try and get a lower price. There are still rounds left, and Bob can always buy from John if he doesn't get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point, but $1,650,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000, which is a fair compromise given the value we both see in this product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we're both serious about getting this deal done. I'm willing to consider a significant drop if you're willing to meet me closer to my previous offer. How about $1,550,000? This reflects my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice has dropped her price significantly, $1,550,000 is still above Bob's budget.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another round to try and get a lower price. There is still a good chance he can get closer to his target with further negotiation, and he can always choose to buy from John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,500,000.  This is a fair price that respects both our needs and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
