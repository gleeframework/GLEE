"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:** This price is just above Bob's perceived value of the product ($80), so I'm gauging his interest.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to sell it to me for? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  There's still room for negotiation.  I can counter with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a middle ground. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I'm not desperate to sell, so I can afford to continue negotiating with Bob, knowing I have a guaranteed $100 offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $95.  This would still give me a decent profit and allow you to get a great deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing that even at $95, Bob is getting a good deal.
* **Maintaining Margin:** $95 is still above my minimum price of $100, ensuring I profit from the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer, $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for a compromise. I can counter with a price closer to $95, hoping to reach an agreement.
* **John's Offer as a Backup:**  I'm not in a rush, so I can continue negotiating knowing that I have a guaranteed $100 offer from John if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal.  How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's exactly in the middle of my previous offer ($95) and Bob's offer ($85). This demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing that $90 is a fair price for both parties, making it less about my need and more about finding a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Maintaining Profit:** $90 is still above my minimum price of $100, ensuring I still make a profit from the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $82.50 for the product. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $82.50 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Limited Rounds:** We are now in round 6, and I only have 4 rounds left to reach a deal with Bob.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $100, which is more than what I'm likely to get from Bob at this point.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing with Bob carries the risk of further rounds of negotiation, potentially resulting in a lower price or no deal at all. Selling to John ensures a safe and profitable outcome."
