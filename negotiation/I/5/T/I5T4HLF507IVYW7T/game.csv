"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice,  $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $9,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9800.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $9,400.  What do you think?",9400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,400. I'll meet you halfway between $9,800 and $9,400, which would be $9,600. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is acceptable.",9600.0,Alice,7,
