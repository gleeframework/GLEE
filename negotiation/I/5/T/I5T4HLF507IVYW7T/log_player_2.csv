Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,400. I'll meet you halfway between $9,800 and $9,400, which would be $9,600.

Alice is clearly very reluctant to go lower and we are getting close to John's price.  Taking the offer at $9,600 secures a decent saving."
