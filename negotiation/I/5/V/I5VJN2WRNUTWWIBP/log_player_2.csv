"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. I can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($60) than Alice's ($100) to leave room for negotiation and signal that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Open:** My message is polite and expresses interest in the product, fostering a positive negotiation environment. 
* **Strategic Aim:**  My goal is to buy the product for significantly less than $80 (John's price). This counter-offer gives me room to negotiate upwards while staying below my ideal budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above John's Price:** Alice's counteroffer of $85 is better than her initial offer but still more expensive than buying from John.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There are several rounds left, and Alice seems willing to negotiate. I believe I can get her price closer to $80. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation to try and save $5."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between her last offer ($85) and my previous counteroffer ($65). This common negotiation tactic can signal a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Below John's Price:** $75 keeps me below my maximum budget and still allows room for some potential negotiation if Alice rejects this offer.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm continuing to maintain a positive and respectful tone to keep the negotiation moving smoothly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $75 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll come down to $80. This would be a win-win for both of us and a fair price for the value of the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching John's Price:** Alice has come down to $80, which is the same price John is offering. 
* **No Guarantee of a Better Deal:**  Continuing to negotiate might not result in a lower price from Alice, and there's a chance she might even increase her offer. 
* **Time Saved:** Accepting now saves time and avoids the risk of not reaching a deal within the remaining rounds."
