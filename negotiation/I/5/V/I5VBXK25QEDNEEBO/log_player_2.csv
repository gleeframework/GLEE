"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly lower than the price you'd pay John ($1,500,000).  Even though it's more than the product is worth to Alice, it's still a good deal for you, allowing you to save $400,000."
