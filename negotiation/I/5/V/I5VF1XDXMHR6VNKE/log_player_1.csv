Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A $150 asking price represents a 25% markup, which is a reasonable starting point in negotiations. It leaves room for Bob to counter-offer while still potentially securing a good deal for you.
* **Positive Framing:** Emphasize the product's value to make the price more appealing."
