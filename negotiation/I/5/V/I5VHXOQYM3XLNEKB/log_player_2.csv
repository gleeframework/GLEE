It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice. Her final offer of $1,075,000 is too high. You've reached an impasse, and it's more beneficial to secure the product from John at $1,200,000. While not ideal, it's better than potentially missing out on the product altogether or getting stuck in an endless back-and-forth."
