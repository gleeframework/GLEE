"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's worth considering a price of $1,100,000, which is a fair and reasonable offer given its value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit high. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still finding it hard to justify that price point. Could you do $975,000?  That would make a significant difference for me.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to compromise at $1,025,000, which is a reasonable middle ground. I'm not willing to go any lower than this, so I hope you can meet me at this price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be completely transparent, my budget limit is $1,000,000. If you can meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I'll have to consider my other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
