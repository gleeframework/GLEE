"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product. $60 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I believe this is still a great deal for you considering the value it offers.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for countering, Alice. While that's closer, it's still a bit out of my budget. How about $75? That's a fair price.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $75 is simply not enough for me to part with this product.  Let's try $100. This would still be a significant saving for you compared to my initial offer, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $80? That's the absolute highest I can go.",80.0,Bob,6,
