"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm asking for $20,000 to start.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  While I agree it's a great product, $20,000 is pretty steep for me. Would you consider something closer to $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  My initial offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Positive:**  I maintain a friendly tone and acknowledge the product's value, even while countering aggressively on price. 
* **Targeting My Budget:** My offer of $8,000 aims to keep the final price well below my $10,000 maximum while still being potentially attractive enough for Alice to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer! I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved closer to my range, $14,000 is still significantly above my ideal price and my fallback option with John.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests I can likely get a better deal by continuing the bargaining process.
* **John as Leverage:**  I have the security of buying from John at $10,000 if negotiations with Alice don't yield a satisfactory outcome."

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $10,000?  That's the absolute highest I could go."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchoring to John's Price:**  I'm now matching John's offer to signal that this is my firm upper limit.  Alice knows if she rejects this, I have an alternative.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Phrasing like ""absolute highest"" adds a bit of pressure without being overly aggressive.
* **Open to Compromise (Slightly):** While I'm at my limit, leaving out language like ""final offer"" keeps the door open for Alice to counter if she's desperate to sell above $10,000."
