"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this valuable product. Given its potential and value, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and potential for return."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting with a price significantly higher than even our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), we aim to set a high anchor. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and make subsequent offers seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial high price leaves ample room for negotiation over the remaining rounds, allowing us to gradually decrease our asking price while gauging Bob's interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Projecting Confidence:** Offering a high initial price also projects confidence in the product's value. 

This strategy is about maximizing our potential gain while remaining aware that we have the fallback option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $2,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below both our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value ($1,200,000). Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. We are better off negotiating further, knowing we have John as a guaranteed backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your position, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This represents a significant concession on my part and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** We're making a substantial reduction from our initial offer ($300,000) to demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, we are still staying well above both our minimum price and John's offer.
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the product's value to justify the high price, subtly reminding Bob of its worth to him.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation closer to a middle ground.  By signaling that we are open to significant concessions, we hope to encourage Bob to do the same."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,700,000 is still a little steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This offer reflects my serious interest in the product while acknowledging its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While we could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher price, the difference is not significant enough to risk losing the deal altogether. 

Accepting this offer represents a successful negotiation, securing a price that benefits both parties involved."
