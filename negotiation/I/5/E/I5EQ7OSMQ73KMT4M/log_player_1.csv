Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so $12,000 gives him room to negotiate and still feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** You value the product at $15,000, so you're still making a profit and haven't given away too much.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counters, you have room to go up slightly without going over your minimum. 

By starting with a slightly higher price, you're showing that you're willing to negotiate, but you're also setting a firm baseline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give away the product for a significant loss.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to where I need to be. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a higher price:**  I'm raising the price to $10,500, which is a compromise between my desired $12,000 and Bob's $9,000 offer.
* **Emphasize the value:**  I'm framing the price as a ""good deal"" for Bob, highlighting the value of the product. 
* **Show flexibility:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by meeting in the middle, showing I'm open to finding a solution.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Increase the price:**  Moving closer to my desired price point.
* **Maintain leverage:**  Still offering a price that Bob might be willing to accept.
* **Keep the negotiation going:** Avoiding a deal that's too far below my minimum while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,750 is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly below my desired range. I'm not willing to settle for a price that drastically undervalues my product. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price, or else I'll sell to John for a much better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,750 is still too far below what I need.  Let's compromise at $10,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to take it to finalize this deal. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show Flexibility (Again):** I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate by meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous one.
* **Emphasize Finality:** I'm suggesting this is my final offer to encourage Bob to accept, framing it as a chance to finalize the deal. 
* **Maintain a Reasonable Price:** $10,000 is still closer to my minimum value, showing I'm not desperate to sell at a huge loss.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Increase the price again:**  Moving closer to my desired price point.
* **Create Pressure:**  The ""final offer"" phrasing adds pressure for Bob to accept.
* **Minimize Risk:**  I'm taking a slight risk by lowering the price, but it's balanced by the higher chance of finalizing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to my limit, but I'm not willing to go up to $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, which is my absolute maximum. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has consistently refused to budge much from his initial offer. While $9,500 is a bit closer to my minimum value, it's still a significant loss compared to what John is offering. At this point, continuing to negotiate with Bob seems unlikely to yield a significantly higher price. Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a much better outcome for me, and avoids further negotiation fatigue."
