"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I believe it's worth a significant investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile purchase.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your interest in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm afraid $600,000 is below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me some of the way, Alice.  While I believe in the value of the product, I can't justify going as high as $825,000. How about $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $700,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll offer it to you for $775,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  $775,000 is getting close, but it's still a bit more than I had hoped to spend.  Would you consider meeting in the middle at $737,500?",737500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more attempt to meet you in the middle. However, $737,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'll offer it to you for $760,000. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",760000.0,Alice,7,
