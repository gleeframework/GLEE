"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm selling it for $90. It's worth a lot more to you than that, so it's a great deal! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $90 is less than John's $100, it's still above your $80 limit. By rejecting this offer, you open the possibility of Alice proposing a lower price, getting you closer to your goal of saving money."
