"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,800,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further discussion.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is reasonable, the product's value is strongly tied to its potential for even greater returns, which I believe justifies a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This offer reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,550,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to discuss further if necessary.",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually agreeable price. To demonstrate my willingness to close this deal, I'm proposing a final offer of $1,600,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and its potential for significant returns.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,600,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,575,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. I hope we can find a way to agree on a price that works for both of us.",1575000.0,Bob,6,
