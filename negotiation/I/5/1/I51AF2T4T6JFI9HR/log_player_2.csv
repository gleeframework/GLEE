(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob would prefer to pay $8,000,  Alice's offer of $10,500 is now within his budget and represents a significant discount from her initial asking price.  There's no guarantee that Alice will go lower, and continuing to negotiate might result in her walking away.  It's better for Bob to accept this offer and secure the product."
