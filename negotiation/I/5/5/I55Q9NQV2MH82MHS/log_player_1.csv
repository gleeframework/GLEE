Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer you, as Alice, could send to Bob:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I propose a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible without scaring him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows some room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting you in the middle.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000 provides a safety net. You won't accept anything less than that.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Depending on your negotiation style and Bob's personality, you might choose a different approach."
