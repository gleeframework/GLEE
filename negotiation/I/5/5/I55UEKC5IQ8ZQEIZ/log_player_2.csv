"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to us, we believe it's worth $800,000 to you. Considering this, would you be interested in discussing the details further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum price point, there's no harm in seeing if you can get a better deal. You have 10 rounds, and rejecting the offer allows you to explore potential concessions from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I value the product, $800,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $750,000. Would you be open to discussing this further?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by showing Alice that you're serious about buying but are looking for a lower price. A $50,000 decrease is a reasonable starting point, indicating your willingness to negotiate without being overly aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering our costs and the value we place on the product, we're proposing to adjust our price to $775,000. This still allows us a reasonable profit while offering you a competitive price. Would you like to discuss this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your preferred price point.  Accepting the offer at $775,000 saves you $25,000 compared to John's offer and is a good deal within your budget.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
