"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to be selling this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $18,000 to start.  I'm open to discussing the price, so feel free to share your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 18000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):** I'm starting significantly higher than my minimum ($12,000) and a good bit above Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially gauge how badly Bob wants the product. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I've made it clear that I'm flexible and open to hearing Bob's thoughts. This encourages him to engage in the negotiation process. 
* **Alternative Option (John):**  I have John as a backup option, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob at any cost.  This knowledge allows me to be more confident in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your effort. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is still $2,000 above what he values the product at, indicating room for negotiation.
* **Too Far From My Minimum:** Accepting $10,000 is a $2,000 loss compared to selling to John. I believe I can get closer to my minimum with further negotiation. 
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to present a counter-offer that brings the price closer to my desired range while still acknowledging his budget concerns."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your counter-offer, Bob. I understand your budget considerations, but $10,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Apparent):**  By suggesting $15,000, I'm aiming for a compromise that appears fair on the surface (halfway between my initial offer and his). 
* **Still Above My Minimum:** This price point still provides me with a $3,000 profit over my minimum acceptable price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer will help me gauge Bob's flexibility and how badly he wants the product.  If he rejects this, I'll need to consider more carefully whether to continue negotiating or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $12,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, securing me a profit.
* **Strong Negotiation by Bob:**  Bob has consistently negotiated well and is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer in subsequent rounds. 
* **Time Value & Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. Accepting now allows me to move on to other potential deals and avoids the risk of losing both Bob and John."
