"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down to $105. That's still a fair price for this great product, and it's within your range. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see where you're coming from, but $95 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference at $100? That way, we both get a fair deal, and I can get this great product into your hands.  Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,5,
