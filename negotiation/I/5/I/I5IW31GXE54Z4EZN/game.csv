"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $8,500 right now. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I have to make a living. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $16,000 to be comfortable. How about we compromise at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute maximum. Let me know if you're open to that.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to be as close to your budget as possible, but I still need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, which is the lowest I can go. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",14000.0,Alice,5,
