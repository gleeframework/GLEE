"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $80.  Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though! I can offer you the product for $120. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price Alice. However, $120 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $90? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to buy if you agree.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised a lot by coming down to $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer you the product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",110.0,Alice,5,
