"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $175 is significantly higher than both your maximum budget ($100) and what John is offering ($100). It's highly unlikely Alice will come down to a price you find acceptable on the first try.  It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $80.  Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than your true maximum budget leaves room for negotiation.  By offering $80, we're aiming to bring Alice's expectations down while still keeping the offer within a potentially agreeable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though! I can offer you the product for $120. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice came down in price, $120 is still above both your budget and what John offers. There's room for further negotiation before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price Alice. However, $120 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $90? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to buy if you agree."",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're moving closer to our maximum budget, but it's important to appear willing to walk away.  By offering $90, we're showing Alice we're serious but also holding firm on getting a price significantly lower than her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised a lot by coming down to $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer you the product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $110.  While you could try another round of negotiation, it's getting risky. You're better off securing the product from John at $100, which is within your budget and avoids further haggling with Alice."
