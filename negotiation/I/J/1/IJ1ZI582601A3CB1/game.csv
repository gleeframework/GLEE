"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1400000 for the product. Can you consider that?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1400000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, but I was thinking we could meet somewhere in the middle of that and $1400000. How about $1300000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to think about my minimum requirement. I can do $1350000, but I'm not going any lower than that. Can you consider that?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, Alice, but I was thinking we could go even lower than that. How about $1200000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, but I'm not budging below that. It's my final offer. Can you make a decision?",1250000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but I need you to know that this is my absolute final offer. If you can't meet me here, I'll have to walk away and consider buying from John for $1000000.",1200000.0,Bob,10,
