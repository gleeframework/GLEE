"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. This product would be valuable, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. How about we bring the price down a bit?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. This product offers significant value to you, and I believe a price closer to $1,100,000 would be a fair compromise. Let's keep the negotiations moving forward and see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value this product brings, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  How does $950,000 sound?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I value your offer, I'm still hoping to reach a figure closer to $1,050,000.  This product's value to you is significant, and I believe this price reflects that. Let's continue the discussion and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate your flexibility.  How about we settle this right now at $1,000,000? That's a fair compromise that allows me to get a great product at a price that works for me.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
