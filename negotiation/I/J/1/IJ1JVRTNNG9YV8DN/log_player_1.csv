"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. This product would be valuable, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. How about we bring the price down a bit? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price range. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to maximize my profits."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. This product offers significant value to you, and I believe a price closer to $1,100,000 would be a fair compromise. Let's keep the negotiations moving forward and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value this product brings, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  How does $950,000 sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I still have a few rounds left and can potentially get a better deal. Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, and I believe I can convince him to go a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I value your offer, I'm still hoping to reach a figure closer to $1,050,000.  This product's value to you is significant, and I believe this price reflects that. Let's continue the discussion and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate your flexibility.  How about we settle this right now at $1,000,000? That's a fair compromise that allows me to get a great product at a price that works for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$1,000,000 is a great deal, exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 and getting me closer to my desired price range. It's a good compromise that allows for a smooth and quick close.  Further negotiation might risk a stalemate or Bob backing out entirely."
