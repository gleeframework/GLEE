Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above your minimum price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate the price down.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $120 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you're guaranteed a sale at your minimum acceptable price."
