"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $19,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 19000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $19,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?  This price reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $14,000.  It's a fair price considering the value I see in the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob seems firmly set at $14,000. It's unlikely he'll go higher, and accepting his offer would mean a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed offer."
