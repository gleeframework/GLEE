Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it offers."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible while still making a profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $135 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, so I don't need to go any lower than that.

By offering the product at $135, I have a good chance of selling it to Bob for a profit while still having the safety net of John's offer."
