"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to the $1,000,000 range. This product is worth a lot to me, but I need to make sure it's a good deal. Let's work together to find a price that makes sense for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to pay closer to $1,000,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the product's worth to you, while also allowing me to get a good deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,100,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit too high.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would be a fair price that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price that balances the product's value to you with my desired profit margin. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
