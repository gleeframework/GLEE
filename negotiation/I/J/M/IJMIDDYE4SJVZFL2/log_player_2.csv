(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is a good price, I want to try and get it even lower. I have 10 rounds and a backup option with John, so there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your product, but $85 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your offer, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $80 for the product. I hope this meets within your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still aiming for a price closer to $75.  Alice is showing flexibility, but I'm not ready to give in just yet.  I have more rounds and John as a fallback, so I'll try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $80 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $77.50, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 77.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your patience and willingness to negotiate. I'm glad we're making progress. My counteroffer is $79 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $79, which is only $2.50 more than my last counteroffer.  I'm getting close to my desired price range, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price.  It's time to accept the offer."
