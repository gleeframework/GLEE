Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  I know it's worth a lot to you, and I think this is a fair price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation, leaving room for some potential bargaining.  It also frames the offer in a way that emphasizes the value to Bob, making him more likely to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is important to you, but I believe I can't exceed $12,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, accepting his offer is the best option. This allows me to sell the product quickly and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
