,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I appreciate it, but $110 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90, which is a fair compromise. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $93, which is a fair price for a product of this quality.  Let's close this deal, I think we're both very close to an agreement.",93.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $93 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $91, which is a significant step closer to your offer. Let's try to find a compromise here. What do you think?",91.0,Bob,6,
