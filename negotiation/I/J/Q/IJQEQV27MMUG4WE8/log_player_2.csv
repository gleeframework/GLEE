"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a decent price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. There's room for negotiation since Bob's maximum value is $80 and Alice's minimum is likely lower than $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I appreciate it, but $110 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** This counteroffer is a good starting point because it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Fair Offer:**  $85 is a fair price considering Bob's maximum value is $80 and Alice wants to sell for at least $120. 
* **Negotiation:** This counteroffer sets the stage for further negotiation, allowing Alice to either accept or make a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** Although Alice has lowered her price, there's still room for further negotiation. Bob's maximum value is $80, and Alice is willing to sell for at least $120. There's a potential middle ground.
* **Seeking a Better Deal:**  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to his target of $80. 
* **Time is on Bob's side:** With 10 rounds, Bob has enough time to negotiate and potentially find a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90, which is a fair compromise. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  Bob is increasing his offer by $5, showing a willingness to compromise while staying within his budget.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between Bob's previous offer of $85 and Alice's current offer of $95.
* **Focus on Fairness:** The message emphasizes ""fair compromise"" and ""finding a solution that works for both,"" making Bob seem reasonable and open to negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $93, which is a fair price for a product of this quality.  Let's close this deal, I think we're both very close to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice has lowered her price further, $93 is still above Bob's maximum value of $80. 
* **Negotiation is Key:**  There's still room for negotiation to reach a price that's acceptable to both parties. Bob has time and the opportunity to continue negotiating.
* **Seeking the Best Deal:**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better price without sacrificing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $93 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $91, which is a significant step closer to your offer. Let's try to find a compromise here. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 91} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  Bob is increasing his offer by just $1, showing he's getting closer to Alice's price but not overstepping his budget.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** The message emphasizes ""compromise"" and ""finding a solution"" to maintain a collaborative tone.
* **Positive Tone:** The message uses phrases like ""significant step closer"" to convey a sense of progress and encourages Alice to agree."
