Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,500. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 

This approach allows for:

* **Potential for a win-win:** Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than his initial $12,000 value, and I can get closer to my desired $15,000.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, I can adjust my price downwards slightly, ensuring we both have some space to work with.
* **Backup option:**  If the negotiation drags on or Bob proves unwilling to meet my expectations, I have the option of selling to John for my desired $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer** and continue negotiating. While $13,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my desired price point. 

By rejecting, I can:

* **Potentially get closer to my desired price:**  I can try to push for a higher price in the next round. 
* **Assess Bob's willingness to compromise:**  His counteroffer signals that he might be willing to pay a bit more.
* **Maintain leverage:** I can still sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm making a counteroffer of $14,000. Here's why:

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $14,500 to $14,000. This shows my willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for further discussion.
* **Maintaining value:** $14,000 is still above Bob's initial offer and closer to my desired price than his counteroffer.
* **Testing the waters:** This offer allows me to gauge Bob's flexibility and potentially secure a price closer to my target without immediately resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to **SellToJhon**.  

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer is now significantly lower than my initial price and the negotiations seem to be stalling. 

Selling to John for $15,000 ensures:

* **Meeting my desired price:** This guarantees I'll get the price I'm comfortable with.
* **Minimizing risk:** Further negotiation with Bob might lead to even lower offers or a protracted process. 
* **Certainty and efficiency:** Selling to John provides a quick and secure transaction, saving me time and energy."
