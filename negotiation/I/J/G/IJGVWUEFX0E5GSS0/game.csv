"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your interest. However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. How about $12,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know if this works for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're both trying to find a good deal. How about we split the difference this time? I'm willing to come down to $12,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and it avoids us going back and forth any further. Let me know if you're interested.",12000.0,Alice,5,
