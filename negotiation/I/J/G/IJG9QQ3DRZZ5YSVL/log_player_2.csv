"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a better price than John's $1,500,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, there's a significant gap between her floor and your ceiling.  Rejecting allows you to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant step towards Alice's likely floor price, while still leaving some room for negotiation.  It's a reasonable starting point that shows I'm serious about buying but also that I'm looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $925,000, which is closer to my desired price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that she might become less flexible or I might end up paying more if I go back and forth.  At $925,000, I'm saving a substantial amount compared to buying from John, making it a good deal."
