Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible, and I know Bob values the product at $1,500,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I start high, the price leaves some room for Bob to negotiate, making him feel more in control of the deal. 
* **Backup Option:**  I have a safety net with John, ensuring I won't go below my minimum price of $1,000,000.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to make a decision quickly."
