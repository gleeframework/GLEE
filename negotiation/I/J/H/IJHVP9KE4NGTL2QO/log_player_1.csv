Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be perfect for your needs and am willing to let it go for $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your minimum ($12,000) but significantly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) creates a potential win-win. Bob gets a ""deal"" and you make a larger profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $11,500,  there's room to negotiate down slightly if Bob hesitates, ensuring you still get more than John's offer."
