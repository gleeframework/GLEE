Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, giving you significant leverage.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible without pushing him away.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation (Optional):** While not explicitly part of this scenario, starting slightly lower, like $1,400,000, could open the door for Bob to negotiate up, potentially landing you even closer to $1,500,000.
* **The John Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 (your minimum) allows you to be bolder with Bob.

**Important:** This is just one strategy.  Factors like your relationship with Bob, negotiation styles, and the product's nature could influence your approach."
