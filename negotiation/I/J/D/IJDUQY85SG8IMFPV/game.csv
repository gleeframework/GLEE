"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is exceptionally high, and $1,200,000 falls a bit short of what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your understanding, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial counteroffer, so I'm proposing $1,225,000. Is this a more comfortable price for you?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
