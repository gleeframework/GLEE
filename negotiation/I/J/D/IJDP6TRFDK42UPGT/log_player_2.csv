**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $12,000 is better than John's price of $15,000, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $12,500 for the product. How about we discuss a price of $12,500?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible deal. While Alice's offer of $12,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should reject the offer and try to get a price closer to his initial counteroffer of $10,500."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand we're getting closer, Bob, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer on this price point.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $12,000 is still better than John's price of $15,000. While Bob would prefer to pay less, it's unlikely Alice will budge further. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price while avoiding the risk of further negotiations or having to buy from John."
