"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,350,000 is fair. This is a chance to gain something truly unique. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. It's above my maximum budget of $1,500,000. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $1,350,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in acquiring it, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time. This would still be a significant profit for you, and it's the highest I can go without exceeding my budget."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what you're gaining. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my desired price point.  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my target of $1,000,000.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This price reflects a fair value for the product, and it's the highest I can offer at this time."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  How about we settle at $1,150,000? This represents a significant concession on my part while still reflecting the inherent value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, but I believe we can still squeeze out a bit more. I'm willing to go a bit higher than my previous counteroffer, but I don't want to get too close to my budget limit just yet. I'll try to find a middle ground in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget limit, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and it would allow me to acquire the product without exceeding my budget.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
