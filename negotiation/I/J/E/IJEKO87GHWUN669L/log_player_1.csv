Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm not willing to go up to $94. I'm still thinking of the $92.50 I offered earlier. I'm willing to add a small premium for the product's value, but $94 is too high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $93?

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $93.  It's not as high as I initially hoped, but it's close to my target, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  I'm also starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds."
