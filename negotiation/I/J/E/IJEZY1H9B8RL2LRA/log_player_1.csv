"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. This is a truly unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm framing the message to highlight the product's value and create a sense of urgency.
* **Open to Discussion:**  I'm ending the message with a question to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Potential:** While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I believe the product holds more value. Bob's immediate lowball offer indicates he's not fully aware of the product's potential.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a higher price and explore if there's room for compromise. I'm not in a rush to sell, and 10 rounds gives me the flexibility to negotiate.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me security. If negotiations with Bob fall apart, I have a guaranteed sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I believe this product has the potential to be worth much more to you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000 as a starting point. This reflects the value I know you'll realize from it. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm presenting a counteroffer that's a significant step down from my initial price but still higher than Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential and emphasizing the value he could gain.
* **Collaborative Tone:** I'm using language that encourages collaboration and finding a mutually beneficial solution. 
* **Open Door:**  I'm leaving the door open for further discussion and potential compromises."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1750000 is a fair price. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product, but that's my absolute maximum. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining Value:** Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, and while he's willing to go higher than his initial offer, it's still too low. 
* **Potential for Improvement:**  There are still 6 rounds left. By rejecting his offer, I can try to push him closer to my desired price point.
* **John's Security:** I have the safety net of selling to John for $1,500,000, which provides me with a reliable fallback option if the negotiations with Bob don't work out.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'm employing a strategy of gradual concessions to see if I can get Bob to increase his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to consider a price closer to the middle ground â€“ $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that recognizes both our needs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise & Middle Ground:** I'm highlighting the compromise I'm making, aiming for a price that's closer to the middle ground between our last offers. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Fairness & Value:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer, reminding Bob that it's still a significant price, but one that acknowledges the value of the product. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation. 
* **Strategic Move:** This offer positions me to potentially close the deal at a price closer to my desired amount while still keeping John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1600000 is a good price. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think that buying from John for $1000000 might be a better option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lowball Offer:** Bob's offer is now significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and even lower than John's offer. He's clearly trying to lowball me and doesn't seem to value the product highly.
* **Time Running Out:** We're halfway through the negotiation rounds, and there's no indication that Bob is willing to budge significantly.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a guaranteed sale at a price that's higher than Bob's current offer and meets my minimum requirement. 
* **Risk Mitigation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of wasting time and potentially ending up with a lower price. Selling to John secures a deal with a reliable buyer at a decent price."
