"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  You're aiming to save as much money as possible.  $50 is a good starting point, but there's likely room for negotiation. You can try to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 35}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a 30% discount from Alice's initial price. This shows my interest in the product while still leaving room for negotiation. It's likely Alice will counter, but I'm hoping to establish a lower price point early on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $40. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $40
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While $40 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, there's still room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial counteroffer of $35.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 38}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from $35 to $38. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but still want a good price. Hopefully, Alice will accept this offer, as it's a fair compromise between our previous offers.  If she rejects, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or go with John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $45. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $45
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While $45 is closer to my ideal price, I'm not ready to settle yet. Alice has increased her offer, but I believe I can still get a better deal. Rejecting this offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a price closer to $40.  If Alice continues to increase her offer, I'll need to consider whether it's worth taking the risk of going to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 42}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer again to $42, moving closer to Alice's last offer but still keeping it below $45. This shows a willingness to meet halfway while also demonstrating that I'm still committed to getting a good price. We're getting close to a potential deal, but I want to see if I can squeeze a little more out of the negotiation before accepting a price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $55. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $55
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is now higher than my initial target of $50. I've tried negotiating down from her initial offer and have gotten close to my desired price point, but it's clear she's not budging.  With only 3 rounds left, I'm running out of time and it's unlikely I can secure a price lower than $55. It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $100."
