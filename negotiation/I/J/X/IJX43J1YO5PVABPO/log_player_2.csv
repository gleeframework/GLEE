Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $75 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $95. It's the best I can do, and I think you'll really enjoy it.

It seems like Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $95.  At this point, it's more beneficial to cut your losses and buy from John for $80."
