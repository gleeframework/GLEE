"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $16,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really get a lot of value out of it.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is my final offer. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $16,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a compromise, but I think it's a good deal for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,5,
