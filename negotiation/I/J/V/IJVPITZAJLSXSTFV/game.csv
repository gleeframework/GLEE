"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm and the potential of this product, $500000 is quite a bit lower than I was expecting. Given my budget and the value I'm seeking, I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to achieve a good profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
