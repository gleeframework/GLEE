"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Let's start with a more realistic figure - I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a number that works for both of us. While I recognize your offer is a serious one, the value this product brings is undeniable. How about we meet halfway and settle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $900,000 is closer, but still a bit out of my range. Let's compromise at $875,000. It's a fair price that shows I'm serious about buying the product, while still giving you a healthy profit.",875000.0,Bob,4,
