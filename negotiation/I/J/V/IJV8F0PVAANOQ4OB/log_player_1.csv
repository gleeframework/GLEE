Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Let's start with a more realistic figure - I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
