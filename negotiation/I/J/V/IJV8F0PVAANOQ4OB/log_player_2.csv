"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. I know you'll recognize its value instantly. How about we start at $950,000? I think that's a fair opening considering the potential you'll unlock. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high, even though it's a good starting point. As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Let's start with a more realistic figure - I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming for a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer. $850,000 is still a decent profit for Alice while being closer to my target of saving as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a number that works for both of us. While I recognize your offer is a serious one, the value this product brings is undeniable. How about we meet halfway and settle at $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down slightly, $900,000 is still too high. I'm confident I can get a better deal with continued negotiation.  I'll counteroffer again, aiming to bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $900,000 is closer, but still a bit out of my range. Let's compromise at $875,000. It's a fair price that shows I'm serious about buying the product, while still giving you a healthy profit."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to inch closer to Alice's desired price, but also staying firmly within my budget. This offer shows a willingness to compromise, potentially leading to a quick agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference again and land at $887,500? That's my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true worth of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting very close to my target price.  While I could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she'll get stubborn and I'll end up paying more.  Additionally, with only 5 rounds left, I don't want to risk running out of time and having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal and saves me money."
