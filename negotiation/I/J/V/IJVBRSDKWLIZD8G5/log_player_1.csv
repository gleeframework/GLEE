"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth $15,000 to me, and I know you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasize Value:** I highlight the product's worth to me, implying its inherent quality and potential value to Bob. 
* **Open Communication:** I use an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and engage in a conversation. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a win-win scenario where Bob gets a good deal and I earn a decent profit. I'm starting high, but I'm open to negotiation and willing to adjust if necessary. If Bob rejects this offer, I will analyze his counteroffer and make a decision based on the remaining rounds and my goal of maximizing profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Potential:** While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my desired profit margin. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** I have 8 rounds remaining, and I believe I can push for a higher price by countering Bob's offer.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm not desperate; I have a backup offer from John for $15,000, which gives me a strong negotiating position.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground that benefits both of us. I'll continue to be mindful of John's offer as a safety net, but I'm confident I can secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is tempting, it's a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $10,500. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's try to find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while demonstrating my willingness to compromise. 
* **Mid-point:**  $10,500 is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, aiming for a mutually agreeable price.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a balanced offer that incentivizes Bob to accept while still leaving me with a decent profit. I'm hoping that Bob sees the value in the product and recognizes the fairness of this price. If he rejects this offer, I will analyze his next counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Goal:** $10,000 is very close to my desired profit margin and significantly better than selling to John.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  We are already halfway through the negotiation process, and it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers.
* **Potential Counteroffers:**  While I could counteroffer, there's no guarantee that Bob will agree, and we might end up in a stalemate.

**Strategy:**

While I would prefer a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic choice. It secures a good profit while minimizing the risk of a failed negotiation. It's important to balance my desire for maximum profit with the need to close a deal before the 10 rounds are up."
