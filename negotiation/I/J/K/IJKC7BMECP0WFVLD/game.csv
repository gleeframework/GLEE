"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you thinking of me. However,  $20,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $15,000.  This would be a good price for both of us.",15000.0,Bob,4,
