"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit high for me. How about $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm happy to pay $115.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make a deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $125. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a good compromise. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there.",125.0,Alice,5,
