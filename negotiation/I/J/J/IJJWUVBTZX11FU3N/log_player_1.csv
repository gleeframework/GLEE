Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,100,000 is still higher than $1,000,000, giving Bob incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $1,100,000 is below your minimum of $1,200,000, leaving room for negotiation without jeopardizing your minimum. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** The message is friendly and straightforward, focusing on the value proposition. 

By offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, you increase the likelihood of him negotiating rather than outright rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. That's my maximum budget for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is far too low. It's below his own perceived value of $1,000,000, and it's significantly below my minimum of $1,200,000.  I need to counteroffer and try to reach a more acceptable price.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is always an option, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  While I'm open to negotiating, I'm unable to go that low. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
``` 

Here's why this counteroffer is a good choice:

* **It's above Bob's offer, but below your minimum:** This shows you're willing to negotiate, but you're not willing to accept a price that's too low for you.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** The message is straightforward and avoids emotional language. 
* **It's a logical compromise:**  Splitting the difference between your last offer and his offer shows you're trying to reach a compromise that benefits both parties.

This counteroffer should help move the negotiations closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,025,000. How about we settle on $987,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my perceived value for the product.  I'm not comfortable selling for less than $1,000,000, as it would be a significant financial loss for me. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $987,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,000,000 is my absolute minimum. This would still represent a good value for you, and it's crucial for me to get at least this much for the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is a good choice:

* **It's a clear and firm stance:**  Stating a firm minimum price shows Bob that you're serious about getting a fair price.
* **It highlights the value for Bob:**  Reminding Bob that $1,000,000 is still a good value for him can help sway his decision.
* **It's a reasonable compromise:** It's a smaller compromise than your previous offer, but it shows you're still willing to negotiate.

This counteroffer aims to reach a final agreement while staying within your desired minimum.  If Bob rejects this offer, you can always sell to John."
