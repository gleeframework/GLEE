"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. That's my maximum budget for this product.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  While I'm open to negotiating, I'm unable to go that low. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,025,000. How about we settle on $987,500?",987500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $987,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,000,000 is my absolute minimum. This would still represent a good value for you, and it's crucial for me to get at least this much for the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
