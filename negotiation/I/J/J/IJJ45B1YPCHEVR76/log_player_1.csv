{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a profitable sale.  I'll see what Bob's response is and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum selling price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can reach a more favorable price.  I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is tempting, I need to get closer to $105 to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference -  what do you think about $100?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $100, which would be $95. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'll be firm in my desire to reach a price closer to my desired range.  I'll counter Bob's offer again, hoping to get him to move closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can't go as low as $95, but I'm willing to compromise a bit more. How about $98? This is a good price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 98} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $98 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm disappointed that Bob isn't willing to come up to a price closer to my desired range, I'm not willing to risk losing even more money by continuing to negotiate. John is offering a guaranteed $120, which significantly surpasses my minimum selling price.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John to secure a profitable sale."
