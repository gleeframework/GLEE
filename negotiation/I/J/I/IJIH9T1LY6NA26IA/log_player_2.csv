"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

This offer is much higher than both your budget and John's offer. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is way beyond my budget. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a good starting point. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer and slightly above your maximum budget, leaving some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $18,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but she's still way above your budget. It's worth another counter-offer to see if you can get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $13,000?"",
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

This counteroffer shows Alice you're willing to negotiate but also sets a firm boundary closer to your actual budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $16,000. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is definitely getting closer to a reasonable price, but you're still above your budget. One more counteroffer is in order before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair deal too, Alice.  $16,000 is still a bit steep for me, but I could potentially go up to $14,000.  I think that's a very reasonable offer."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

We're getting into the critical stage of the negotiation. This counteroffer puts you at the top end of your budget, so you'll need to decide if it's worth going higher or accepting John's offer if Alice rejects it."
