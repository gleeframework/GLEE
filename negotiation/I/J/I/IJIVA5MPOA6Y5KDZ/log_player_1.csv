"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and call it $135?"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While it's not the $135 I countered with, $115 is still a profit over John's offer. It's better to take a smaller profit now than risk Bob walking away and getting only $100 from John."
