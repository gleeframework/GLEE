"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but hopefully not so high that it scares Bob away completely.  I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $90. While it's closer to my minimum price, I'm still hopeful I can get a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $95. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this price will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but still leaves some room for profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $92.  While I was hoping for a bit more, it's a good price and I'm getting closer to my desired profit.  There's always the risk that if I keep rejecting, Bob will walk away or I might end up having to sell to John for the lower price."
