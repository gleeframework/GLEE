Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for your needs and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with $12,000 gives you room to negotiate down if Bob counters. It's also a strong opening, potentially making Bob think the product's value is even higher. 
* **Alternative Buyer Leverage:** While you don't explicitly mention John, the phrase ""before I list it publicly"" subtly implies there are other potential buyers. 

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale if he declines."
