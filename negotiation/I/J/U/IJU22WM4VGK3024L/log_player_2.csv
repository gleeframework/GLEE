"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is lower than her value for the product, but still higher than your maximum price and what John is offering. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is important to keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Justification:**  While I don't need to reveal my absolute maximum, I'm hinting at budget limitations to make my offer seem more reasonable.

By starting low, I'm aiming to see how much Alice is willing to move on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10,500? That's still a good deal for you, and a fair price for the value of the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's Price:** Alice has come down considerably, but her offer is still slightly higher than what John is offering. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** By rejecting this offer, I'm signaling that I'm looking for an even better deal. There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down a bit more, getting closer to John's price. 

It's a calculated risk. There's a chance Alice might stick to her current price or even walk away. However, the potential savings are worth another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $10,250?"",
""product_price"": 10250
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting $10,250, I'm proposing a compromise that splits the difference between her current offer ($10,500) and my target price ($10,000). 
* **Signaling Budget Limits:** This counteroffer reinforces that I'm working within a specific budget. 
* **Maintaining Politeness:**  I continue to use a respectful and appreciative tone to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere. 

This counteroffer aims to secure a deal that's beneficial for both of us, while still achieving some savings compared to Alice's previous offer."
