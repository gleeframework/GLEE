"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10,500? That's still a good deal for you, and a fair price for the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
