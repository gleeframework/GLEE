"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I believe we can find a price that benefits both of us.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price still represents a significant profit for you and allows me to acquire it for a price that's within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I propose a new price of $900,000. This is a reasonable compromise that should benefit both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial counteroffer.  How about $875,000? This would still allow you a substantial profit while giving me a more favorable price. Let's find a way to bridge this gap.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go above $925,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to me is $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our current offers. I propose a new price of $890,000. This is a reasonable compromise that should satisfy both of us.",890000.0,Alice,5,
