Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Not Too High:**  While we want to maximize profit, setting the price exorbitantly high (e.g., $300) will likely make Bob immediately reject the offer.  We know the product is only worth $150 to him.
* **Justification:** By including a brief phrase like ""I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price"", we subtly anchor the value in Bob's mind.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Great! You make a $25 profit.
* **Bob Rejects:** You can either revise your offer downwards or move on to John and sell it for your minimum price of $150."
