Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your interest in our product. While I would like to accommodate your request, the cost of production and the value we place on this product make it challenging to reduce the price further. I propose a counteroffer of $120 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise between our costs and your budget considerations. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement.
