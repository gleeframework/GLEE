"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $130. How about we split the difference and go with $132.50? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $129? That's as low as I'm willing to go.",129.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $129 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to get at least $131 for it. Let's make this deal happen!",131.0,Alice,5,
