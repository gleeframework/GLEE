"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize the value to Bob, making it seem like a good deal for him.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm not being rigid, allowing room for Bob to counter. 
* **John as a backup:**  I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1050000.  That's a fair price considering the value to both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I'd like to get. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I'm comfortable rejecting Bob's offer because I have John as a backup. 

I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000?  That's a fair price considering the product's value to you and the potential for a long-term relationship."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's in the middle between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Emphasize fairness:** I highlight the value of the product to both of us, emphasizing that this price is a fair compromise.
* **Suggest a long-term relationship:** This adds a subtle incentive for Bob to accept, suggesting a future working relationship. 

I believe this counteroffer is more likely to be accepted by Bob, while still giving me a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $1075000. That's a fair compromise, and it shows my commitment to working with you. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can push for a higher price with more negotiation rounds.
* **John's offer remains a safety net:** If I don't secure a better offer from Bob, I have John as a backup. 

I'm not going to rush into a deal just yet. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,075,000 is closer, but I still need a bit more to make this work for me. How about we settle at $1,090,000?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product and our potential for a lasting partnership."", ""product_price"": 1090000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway again:** This counteroffer is in the middle of my previous offer and Bob's latest offer.
* **Focus on long-term potential:** I keep emphasizing the benefits of a future relationship to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Maintaining my minimum:**  This price is still above my minimum acceptable price.

By continuing to meet Bob halfway, I'm showing flexibility and good faith while still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1090000 is still slightly higher than where I'm comfortable. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1080000. This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $20,000 below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Limited rounds remaining:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and the risk of not reaching an agreement is increasing.
* **John's offer is a fallback:** If I reject Bob's offer, I'm not guaranteed a better price from him in the next round, and I could end up selling to John for a lower price.

Considering these factors, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's a reasonable outcome given the circumstances."
