Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 
 
This strategy aims to achieve the following:

* **Maximize Profit:**  By offering the product at $119, you are aiming to get the highest possible price Bob might be willing to pay while still ensuring a profit.
* **Maintain Urgency:**  The ""limited time"" phrase is designed to encourage Bob to make a decision quickly, potentially preventing him from overthinking or negotiating further. 
* **Leave Room for John:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell it to John at your minimum acceptable price. 

Let's see if Bob accepts!"
