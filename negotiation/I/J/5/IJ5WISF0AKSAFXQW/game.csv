"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $120. Let's meet in the middle!",95.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 just isn't enough for me. How about $90? I'm getting closer to your offer, but I still need to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",90.0,Alice,5,
