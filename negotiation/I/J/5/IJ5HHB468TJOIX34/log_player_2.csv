Round 5
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $105.  While she *might* go down a few more dollars, it's not worth the risk of her digging in her heels and the price remaining higher than John's offer. You have a guaranteed option at $100 with John, so it's the best decision to take it now."
