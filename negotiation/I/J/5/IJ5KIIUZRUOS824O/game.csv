"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. Can you consider my counteroffer?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find something that works for both of us.  While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the true value of the product. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,4,
