"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is closer to your maximum price than it is to her minimum. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but  $110 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

This counteroffer attempts to anchor the price closer to my target while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $105? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, but we're still a bit away from a price I'm fully comfortable with.  I'll try to push a bit further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we settle at $98? That's a fair compromise, I think."",
""product_price"": 98
}
``` 

This counteroffer splits the difference of our previous offers and lands at a price point that would be a good deal for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise again. How about $102? It's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling this is her final offer.  $102 is a reasonable price and a good compromise â€“ it gets me the product for less than John while respecting Alice's bottom line.  No point in risking losing the deal at this point."
