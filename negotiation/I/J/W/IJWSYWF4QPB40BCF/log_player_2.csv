(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum price of $1,200,000. It makes sense to try and negotiate a better price.  There's a high chance you can get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly higher than Alice's initial offer, but still well within your budget. It shows that you are willing to negotiate but also signals that you are serious about acquiring the product. This gives Alice a good reason to consider your offer, and potentially start a more productive negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum price, but still below my counteroffer. I'm confident that I can negotiate further and get a price closer to my counteroffer. There is still potential to save a significant amount compared to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, but I'm still willing to negotiate. This counteroffer shows that I'm flexible but still want to get a price lower than my initial counteroffer.  It's a good compromise and increases the chances of reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now just $50,000 away from my previous counteroffer. This is a good compromise. At this point, continuing to negotiate might not yield a significant enough saving to justify the time and effort. Accepting this offer allows me to acquire the product at a price well below my maximum budget and significantly less than buying from John."
