"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  The price is not too far off from Bob's value, allowing for a potential counteroffer without making it seem unreasonable.
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm not willing to go too low too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. Would you consider selling it to me for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:**  My minimum acceptable price is $100.
* **Bob's offer:** Bob is offering $95, which is below my minimum.
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed offer of $100 from John, which is better than Bob's current offer.

**Next steps:**

* I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.
* I will counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimizing Losses:** I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100, but still higher than Bob's last offer.
* **Negotiating Room:**  This price allows for further negotiation, but it keeps the offer close to my desired value.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is clear and direct, stating my willingness to negotiate and reiterating the value of the product for Bob. 
* **Avoiding John:**  At this point, I'm still hoping to close a deal with Bob to potentially get a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. This is the most I am willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob is now offering my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **John's Offer:** John is also offering $100. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  I'm already 4 rounds into the negotiation. Continuing to haggle might lead to further delays and a lower final price.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice. It ensures I get my desired minimum price without the risk of further negotiation and potential delays."
