"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, that's a bit steep. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $18,000 might have been a bit high, but $10,000 is lower than I'm willing to go. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we are finding some common ground. $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to accept $13,000. This seems like a fair compromise. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm happy to go up to $12,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",12500.0,Bob,6,
