Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $110. This is my best offer for now.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you at $105, which is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $105. While getting the product for $105 from Alice is a decent deal, it's better to stick to your absolute limit and buy it for $100 from John."
