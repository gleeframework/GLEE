"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $22000. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to me, and I believe you'll find it's a great investment.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice! However, $22000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at the moment.  Given the value I'm looking for, I'd be willing to pay $10000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $18000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14000.  This feels like a fair price for both of us and allows me to get the product within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14000 is a more comfortable price for you, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you there. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll make a slight adjustment and offer you the product for $16500. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's worth considering.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise further. While $16500 is closer, I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less.  I'm willing to go up to $15000.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,6,
