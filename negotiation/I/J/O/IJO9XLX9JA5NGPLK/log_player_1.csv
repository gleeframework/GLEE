Round 2

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 significantly undervalues the product and the benefits it offers.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking to offers around $9,000.  It's clear he's unlikely to move significantly higher. While I could push for more in the remaining rounds, there's a risk he won't budge, and I'd end up with John's offer of $8,000. Accepting $9,000 now secures a profit and avoids a potential loss."
