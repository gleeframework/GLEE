"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,225,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this works for you.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,225,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as I have another option available at that price. Let me know if this works for you.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,250,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,225,000, but I need to make a bit more profit. Let's meet in the middle at $1,237,500. This is my final offer.",1237500.0,Alice,5,
