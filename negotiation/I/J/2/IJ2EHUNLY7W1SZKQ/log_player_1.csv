Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $11,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
