"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. This maximizes my potential earnings while leaving space for Bob to feel he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can do better. I'm going to counteroffer and try to push for a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering a price that's still higher than Bob's counteroffer but lower than my initial offer. This demonstrates flexibility while also showing that I'm not willing to give in easily."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  Even though it's a better price than John's offer, I'm still aiming for more. There are still several rounds left and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but only slightly. This shows a willingness to compromise, while still maintaining my position of wanting a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and with only 4 rounds left, it's becoming risky to hold out for more. Accepting his offer is the best option to maximize my earnings at this point."
