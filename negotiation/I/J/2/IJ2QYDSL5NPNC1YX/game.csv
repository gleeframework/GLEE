"Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $850,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value to you. Let's finalize this.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $875,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
