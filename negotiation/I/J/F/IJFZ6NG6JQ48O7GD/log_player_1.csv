Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality."", ""product_price"": 150} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($120) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This creates room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a price closer to my initial ask. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""quality"" of the product, I aim to subtly nudge Bob's perception of its value upwards. 

I'm prepared to negotiate down, but I won't go below my $120 minimum. Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage in this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is far below both my minimum acceptable price ($120) and my initial offer.  It's clear he's trying to anchor the negotiation very low. I need to steer the price upwards. I'll reject his offer and propose a counteroffer that's still significantly above his, but lower than my initial price to show some flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $60 is significantly below the product's value. I could consider letting it go for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but not drastic reduction:** I've come down by $20, which is a noticeable reduction but keeps the price well above both Bob's offer and my minimum.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to nudge him away from his low anchor. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm still signaling that I'm willing to negotiate by asking for his thoughts.

My strategy is to gradually decrease my asking price while staying above my $120 threshold.  I'm hoping Bob will make a counteroffer closer to a price point that works for both of us.  However, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $130 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $90 is moving in the right direction, it's still below my minimum of $120. I need to hold firm and signal that I'm willing to walk away from the deal if necessary. I'll reject his offer and present a counteroffer closer to my minimum, making it clear this is my final concession."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I can't go as low as $90.  My final offer is $120.  This is already a very competitive price for what you're getting. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 120}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm explicitly stating this is my final offer to convey a sense of urgency and seriousness.
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm reiterating that this price is already a good deal, subtly suggesting he won't find better elsewhere.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:** I'm mentally prepared to walk away from the negotiation if Bob doesn't accept this offer. I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120, so I'm not losing anything by holding firm."
