Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I can't go as low as $90.  My final offer is $120.  This is already a very competitive price for what you're getting. Let me know if you're interested.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is firm at $120, which is above your maximum price. There's no point in further negotiation.  You'll get the best deal from John at $80."
