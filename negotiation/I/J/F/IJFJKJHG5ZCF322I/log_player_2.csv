"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to his maximum value ($120) as possible.  Offering $105 is a reasonable starting point, showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's previous counteroffer, but still within Bob's budget. However, Bob wants to try to get a lower price. Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to counter and potentially get closer to his ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to pay up to $120 for the product, so offering $110 is still a good deal for him. It's also a reasonable compromise after Alice rejected his previous offer. This demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway while still aiming for a better price than Alice's last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum value.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee he'll get a better deal.  John is offering the same price, but there's no risk of further negotiation or potential rejection.  It's more efficient to buy from John at this point."
