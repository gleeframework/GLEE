# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

The offer is too high. It's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm aiming for a slightly lower price point. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,350,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,350,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not satisfied. It's worth pushing for a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to get a better price.  How about $1,320,000?  This is a fair price that would allow us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1320000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,320,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $1,335,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,335,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,335,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $1,335,000 is a good compromise. It's within my budget, and it's likely that further negotiation will only take more time and might not result in a significantly lower price. It's time to accept the offer and avoid the risk of losing the product to another buyer."
