"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm aiming for a slightly lower price point. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to get a better price.  How about $1,320,000?  This is a fair price that would allow us both to walk away satisfied.",1320000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,320,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $1,335,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",1335000.0,Alice,5,
