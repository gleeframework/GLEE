"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm.  However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value and my budget. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm happy to make a counteroffer. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value and my original asking price. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  I'm still trying to stay within my budget, and $11,500 is just a bit too high.  I'm willing to go to $11,000.  Let's split the difference and see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $11,000. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my original asking price. Let me know what you think!",11800.0,Alice,5,
