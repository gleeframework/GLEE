Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  However, $1000000 is significantly lower than the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price to make this work. How about $1750000?  This is a fair compromise considering the potential value you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While it's a decrease from her initial offer, it's still too high. I will continue to negotiate with Alice to try to get a better price."
