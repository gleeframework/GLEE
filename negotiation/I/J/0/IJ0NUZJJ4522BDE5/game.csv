"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $2000000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm interested in your product, but I'd be willing to pay $1000000.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  However, $1000000 is significantly lower than the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price to make this work. How about $1750000?  This is a fair compromise considering the potential value you'll gain.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1750000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $1400000.  This represents a significant investment on my part, and it's the highest I can go at this time.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
