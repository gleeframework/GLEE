Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to the $150 value for Bob, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $80.  This offer leaves room for negotiation and allows me to assess Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the recommendation, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $110? That's still a great price for the value you'll get from this product."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
I'm offering $110, which is a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a profit above the $80 I'd get from John."
