"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $10,000 is unfortunately not a price I can accept at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which reflects the significant value this product offers. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,
