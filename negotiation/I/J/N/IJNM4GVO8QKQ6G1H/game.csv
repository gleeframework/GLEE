"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, $1,100,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000 to demonstrate my commitment to reaching a deal with you. This price still reflects the product's exceptional value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
