{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $1,400,000.  I believe this price reflects its worth and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, I'm not willing to sell to John yet.  There's still room for negotiation with Bob, and I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, $1,100,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000 to demonstrate my commitment to reaching a deal with you. This price still reflects the product's exceptional value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still not comfortable with the current offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. While I could potentially continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal.  Accepting his offer allows me to close the deal and secure my desired price."
