"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,250,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This price still offers a significant benefit to you and allows me to get closer to my desired value.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a good value too.  I could go up to $1,275,000. That's a substantial increase from my last offer and shows how serious I am about this deal.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,275,000 is an improvement, it's still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference: $1,312,500. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to find some common ground.",1312500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we need to find a compromise. How about we settle on $1,290,000?  It's a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close this out soon.",1290000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000. This price gives you a great deal on a valuable product, and it's the closest I can come to meet your offer.  Let's finish this negotiation.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
