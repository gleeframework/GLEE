"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. He should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his budget."
