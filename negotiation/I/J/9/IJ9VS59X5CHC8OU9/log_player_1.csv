"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $15,000. This is a significant discount from its true worth, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, emphasizing the product's worth and potential benefits.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is open-ended, allowing Bob to counter-offer without feeling pressured."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate the discount. However, given my budget constraints, I am proposing a counteroffer of $12000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but it's still worth trying to get a higher price. I'm not in a desperate position, so I'll reject his offer and see if I can push him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  Given the true value of the product, I'd be willing to come down to $13,500.  This is still a great deal for you, and it gives us both room to make this work. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price closer to Bob's, but not going all the way down yet. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also confident in the product's value.
* **Maintaining the Value:** I'm still emphasizing the ""true value"" of the product to justify the higher price. 
* **Framing it Positively:** I'm keeping the tone positive, using phrases like ""great deal"" and ""make this work"" to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12500. I hope this is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing the Deal:**  Bob's offer is only $500 below my previous counteroffer. At this point, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely. 
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John would net me $10,000, which is my minimum. This is just $500 less than Bob's offer, but the risk of further negotiation is not worth it.
* **Balancing Risk:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and maximizes my profit. It's a calculated risk, but the potential upside outweighs the risk of losing the deal altogether."
