Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price point.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $115, but that's my final offer. If you're interested, let me know. Otherwise, I'll need to consider my other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $115 is still above your maximum budget of $100, and you have limited rounds remaining.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $100, ensuring you get the product within your budget.  Further negotiation with Alice may not yield a better result, especially since you have a guaranteed alternative."
