"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $95 is a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  It's still a good price for a product that's worth $100 to you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",105.0,Alice,3,
