{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120 because it's higher than my minimum, giving me some room to negotiate.  I'm also being positive and friendly to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to find it at a lower price. Would you consider selling it for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, I'm not comfortable accepting it just yet. I'm going to try and push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $95 is a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  It's still a good price for a product that's worth $100 to you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my original budget. Could you consider selling the product for $100? This would allow us to reach an agreement that is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price.  I could keep negotiating, but I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer, and I can get the same price from John."
