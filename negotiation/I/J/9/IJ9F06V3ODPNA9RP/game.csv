"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $9,000 doesn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this amazing product.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",8500.0,Bob,4,
