"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, I propose a price of $125 for it. This price reflects its worth and ensures you receive a valuable item at a fair price. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum willingness to pay ($150). By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can still purchase the product from John for a price closer to his preferred range."
