"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective on the price. However, $6,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and what it can do for you.  To move this forward, I could consider $12,000. This feels like a fair compromise.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
