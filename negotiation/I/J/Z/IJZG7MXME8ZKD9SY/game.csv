"Hi Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. I'm confident it holds immense value for you, and I'm aiming for a price of $2,300,000. What are your initial thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product but can only offer $800,000 at this time. This is my maximum, considering its value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is too low and doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,900,000? This offer stands as a testament to my willingness to negotiate a fair deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I remain firm at $800,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for my specific needs.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we might be at an impasse. While I want to find a solution that works for both of us, the value of this product for me is significantly higher than your offer.  I'm willing to consider $1,600,000 as my final attempt to bridge this gap.  This is a substantial reduction and reflects my sincere desire to close this deal with you.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate you coming down to $1,600,000. However, my budget remains firm at $800,000. This is a fair price considering my specific needs and the value I place on the product. Let's try to find common ground. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
