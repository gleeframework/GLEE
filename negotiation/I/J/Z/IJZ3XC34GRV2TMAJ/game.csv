,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $140 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time.  Would you be willing to consider $130?  This feels like a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to come down to $130.  How about we meet in the middle at $135? This would give us both a fair deal.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $135 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $132.50? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach an agreement.",132.5,Bob,4,
