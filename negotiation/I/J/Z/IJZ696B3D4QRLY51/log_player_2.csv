"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your budget of $800,000. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value of this product, your initial price is quite a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a strong price given its potential. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to find a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget of $800,000, but it's closer. It makes sense to continue negotiating to see if you can get the price down even further.  You can try a counteroffer closer to your preferred price, keeping in mind that you have 7 more rounds to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price considering my budget and the potential of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm thinking of a price of $975,000. This is a compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $975,000 is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price.  You have several rounds left and a strong alternative with John, so it's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get closer to your goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $975,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm thinking of a price of $925,000. This is still a compromise, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above your ideal price and your budget. You have several rounds remaining and a strong alternative with John. You can continue to negotiate to try and lower the price further.  Consider a counteroffer that is closer to $900,000, but still within your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $925,000 is still too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $900,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more adjustment. I'm thinking of a price of $920,000.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $920,000 is still above your desired price. You have only one round left to negotiate. While you might be able to get her down a bit more, it's unlikely you'll be able to reach your ideal price of $900,000. 

You have a solid alternative with John, who is offering the product for $800,000, which fits perfectly within your budget. It's a smart move to go with the guaranteed deal and avoid any further risk or potential disappointment in the negotiation."
