"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value of this product, your initial price is quite a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a strong price given its potential. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway.

This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to find a mutually beneficial deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
