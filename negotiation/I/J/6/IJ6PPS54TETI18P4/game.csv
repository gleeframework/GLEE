"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product is worth $120 to you, so I would like to propose a price of $115 for the product. I hope this is acceptable.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $115 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $117.50?  This still gives you a good deal and allows me to get closer to my desired price.",117.5,Alice,3,
