You should choose to **BuyFromJhon**. 

Even though Alice is getting closer to your desired price, you've already reached a point where it's more beneficial for you to buy from John for $800,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks prolonging the process and potentially ending up with a higher price than you're willing to pay."
