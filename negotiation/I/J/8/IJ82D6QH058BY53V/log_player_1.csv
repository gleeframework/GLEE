Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a profit. I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust accordingly. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and make sure I don't end up with less than $1,000,000, as John is a reliable backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000.  This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still leaving me with some profit. Hopefully, he'll find it acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum price.  While $975,000 is not terrible, I can secure a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  It's time to end this negotiation and sell to John."
