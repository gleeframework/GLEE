Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product seems interesting, but the price is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm happy to negotiate, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you see in this product, but $1,600,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're making progress.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $1,500,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

At this point, Bob is unlikely to go higher. Accepting the $1,400,000 offer secures a significant profit over John's standing offer and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
