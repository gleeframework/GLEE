"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to acquire this truly unique product. Its value is immense, and I believe it aligns perfectly with your needs.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product seems interesting, but the price is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm happy to negotiate, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your offer, the value of this product is truly significant, and I can't let it go for less than $1,600,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional returns.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you see in this product, but $1,600,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,500,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.  What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're making progress.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $1,500,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
