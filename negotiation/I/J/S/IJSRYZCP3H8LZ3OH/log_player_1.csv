Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both you and Bob, starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value without revealing specific details, aiming to pique Bob's interest and justify the high price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you don't lose out. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and realism, with the goal of securing the highest possible price from Bob."
