Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000.**  This is what I'll get from John if Bob rejects.
* **I want to maximize my profit.** Therefore, I'm aiming for a higher price.
* **I don't know Bob's valuation.**  A higher price might be too much for Bob, but I'm willing to risk it to see if I can get a better deal.

This offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter-offer, but it starts with a strong price point that reflects my desire for a good profit."
