"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept anything higher at this point. By rejecting, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than what he could pay John. This shows he's interested in negotiating, but also sets a clear boundary.  There's room for Alice to counter without feeling pressured to accept immediately."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is getting closer to Bob's preferred price, but it's still above his maximum threshold.  He should reject the offer and continue negotiating to try to get a lower price.  There's still room for Alice to compromise, and Bob has the safety net of John's offer if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 880000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing he's willing to compromise but still staying below his maximum price.  This is a more aggressive counteroffer, testing Alice's willingness to go further. If Alice rejects, Bob will have to decide whether to make another counteroffer or move to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum threshold. He should reject the offer and continue negotiating. There are still a few rounds remaining, and Bob can leverage the option of buying from John as leverage. It's worth pushing for a lower price, as even a small saving can be significant in this situation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, but only slightly. He's showing Alice he's willing to meet her halfway, but he's also pushing her closer to his preferred price. This is a risky move, as Alice could reject and make a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's maximum. However, it's a gamble worth taking with only four rounds remaining. If Alice rejects, Bob can either make another counteroffer or switch to John's offer, which is still a good option for him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum price of $800,000, and they are running out of rounds. However, rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to negotiate. It's possible that Alice is willing to come down further, and Bob is still in a good position because of the option to buy from John.  He has a strong backup plan, so he can afford to be more aggressive in his counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 895000}
```

**Explanation:**

With only three rounds remaining, Bob needs to push for a deal. He's increasing his offer, but only slightly. This shows Alice he's serious about a deal, but also makes it clear he's not willing to go any higher. 

This is a calculated risk. If Alice rejects, Bob will be forced to either make a final counteroffer or buy from John. However, this also puts pressure on Alice. If she rejects, she risks losing a buyer, as Bob might choose to go with John instead."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a crucial moment.  While Alice's offer is closer than before, it's still above Bob's $800,000 limit. With only one round left, the risk of another failed negotiation is too high.  Bob has a guaranteed option with John, and with the time pressure, it's better to secure the product now than to gamble on another counteroffer that could potentially fail."
