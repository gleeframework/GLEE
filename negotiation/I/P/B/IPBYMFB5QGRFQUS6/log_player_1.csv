"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. I believe it holds immense potential for someone with your expertise. To kick things off, I'd like to propose a starting price of $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer that's favorable to you. This leaves room for negotiation without immediately dropping below your minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's value, potentially justifying the high initial price in Bob's mind.
* **Leaving Room:** The offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it also leaves considerable room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. After considering its worth, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially since I have the option of selling to John for my desired price.  I'll counter in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product to me is considerably higher. I'm willing to negotiate, but $950,000 is too low.  Would you consider $1,050,000?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This message reaffirms the product's high value to me while acknowledging Bob's offer and demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Strategic Concession:** The counteroffer is a significant reduction from my initial price but still keeps me well above Bob's offer and closer to my desired outcome.
* **Maintaining Ground:** This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving without caving in too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, and thank you for your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now at $1,000,000. While it's still less than what I could get from John, it's a significant amount and exceeding this in future rounds might be difficult. Accepting ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
