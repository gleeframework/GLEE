"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $12,000. I think this is a great price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, you can likely get it for less. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, and $11,500 is a good deal for Bob.  It's less than what he'd pay John and still a decent savings compared to Alice's initial offer.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of losing the deal to John at a higher price is too high."
