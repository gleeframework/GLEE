Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than Bob's estimated value of $12,000 but lower than my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and open to negotiation, showing I'm willing to work with Bob to find a fair price.

This offer gives me a good chance to start the negotiation and potentially get a price closer to my desired amount. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make a new counteroffer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,500 is closer to my minimum of $15,000, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I want to see if I can get closer to my goal by negotiating further.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and attempt to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $12,500. However, that's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $13,500. Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $13,500. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate while still staying above my minimum.
* **Message:** The message is positive and emphasizes my willingness to find a solution, keeping the negotiation open.

By taking a smaller step, I aim to gauge Bob's seriousness and potentially reach an agreement. If he rejects again, I'll have to consider selling to John or making another counteroffer, depending on how close we are to reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,500, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. That's the maximum I can afford. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, we've gone back and forth several times, and it's becoming clear that we're unlikely to reach a mutually agreeable price.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000, which guarantees me my minimum desired profit and avoids further negotiation."
