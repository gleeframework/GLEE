"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but I believe the value this product brings to the table is closer to my initial offer.  Would you be willing to consider $1,325,000?
