"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $11,000?  I think that's a fair price considering my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  Let's split the difference and see if we can make this work.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're making an effort to meet me halfway.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is my absolute minimum.  Let's close this deal. It's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,5,
