Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $11,000?  I think that's a fair price considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to sell, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.  I'll see if I can get him to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  Let's split the difference and see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm confident that with a counteroffer, we can come to a deal that benefits us both."
