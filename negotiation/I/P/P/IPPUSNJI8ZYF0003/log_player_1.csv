Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, meaning he has a potential profit of $300,000 if he buys it from you.
* **The Sweet Spot:**  You want to offer a price that's appealing to Bob (giving him a good deal) while maximizing your own profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be a valuable asset to you. I'm offering it at a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message Tone:**  The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value and Bob's exclusive opportunity. 
* **Price Strategy:** The offered price of $1,350,000 splits the difference between your minimum and Bob's maximum. This:
    * Gives Bob a $150,000 profit incentive to buy from you.
    * Earns you an extra $150,000 compared to selling to John.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Notes:**

* This is just one possible approach. You could aim slightly higher and see if Bob negotiates. 
* Be prepared to walk away if Bob makes a counteroffer below your minimum. You have a guaranteed sale with John."
