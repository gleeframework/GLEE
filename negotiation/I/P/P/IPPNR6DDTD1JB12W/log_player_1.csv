"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an ambitious offer. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher final price.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,200,000, you set a high anchor in Bob's mind. Even if he rejects this initial offer, his counteroffers might be influenced by this higher number.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer helps you gauge Bob's interest level and how aggressively he might counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good offer, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. Bob's counteroffer indicates he's definitely interested. Rejecting now gives us the opportunity to see if we can negotiate a price closer to $1,000,000.  We have room to move before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the product's value is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. This reflects its true potential and leaves us some room for negotiation."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  We're coming down from our initial offer, showing Bob we're willing to negotiate. 
* **Hold Firm:** The decrease is relatively small ($100,000), demonstrating we're still aiming for a high price.
* **Maintain Dialogue:** By providing a reason for our counteroffer, we keep the conversation going and encourage Bob to engage further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you believe the product has significant value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to our desired range, but we can still try to push for a bit more. He's now at $950,000, and we're aiming for something closer to $1,000,000.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows us to counter with a figure above John's standing offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you've shown a genuine interest in this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation. Let's find a point we can both agree on. How about $1,025,000? This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while acknowledging the inherent value of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  We're suggesting a price almost exactly halfway between our last offer ($1,100,000) and his ($950,000). This can be a powerful negotiation tactic, signaling fairness and a desire to close the deal. 
* **Strong Language:** Phrases like ""genuine interest"" and ""willingness to compromise"" aim to build rapport and create a more collaborative atmosphere.
* **Above John's Offer:**  Crucially, we're still well above John's $800,000 offer, giving us room to negotiate down if needed in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but I still think that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. I'm willing to make a serious offer at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $975,000 is a very good offer. It's significantly above our minimum ($800,000) and only slightly below our ideal target.
* **""Serious Offer"" Language:** Bob's use of the phrase ""serious offer"" suggests this is likely his final position.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate at this point has diminishing returns. We risk Bob walking away or getting stuck in a stalemate, potentially leaving us with John's lower offer as our only option. 

This offer represents a substantial profit, and it's prudent to accept now and secure the deal."
