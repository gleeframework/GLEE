Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than $100, setting a baseline for negotiations.
* **It's not too high:**  You don't want to scare Bob off immediately. 
* **It gives you room to negotiate:** If Bob rejects, you can lower the price slightly. 

Remember, you can always fall back to John if Bob doesn't accept."
