"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you're looking for a product worth no more than $150 to you, and John is willing to sell it for that price, it makes the most sense to buy from John right away. There's no need to risk negotiating with Alice and potentially ending up paying more."
