"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This reflects the product's worth while still being a fair deal for you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair middle ground.  However,  $1,000,000 is still above what I'm comfortable with. I could consider $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,4,
