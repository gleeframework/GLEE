I'll reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. There are still rounds left and I can always sell to John for $120."

Bob's offers are getting too low, and I'm running out of time. It's better to secure the $120 from John and avoid any further risk of a lower price."
