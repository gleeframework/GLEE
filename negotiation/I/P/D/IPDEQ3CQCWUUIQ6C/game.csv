"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your business, potentially even more than my initial assessment. Considering its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price point is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial assessment.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This feels like a fair price considering the potential benefits it holds for your business.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're firm on the value, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $750,000? That's a significant investment on my end and reflects the value I see in the product.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm confident it can bring significant returns for your business, and I want to ensure a fair deal for both of us. To meet you closer, I'm willing to accept $875,000. This offer stands as a final concession on my end.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, that final offer is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable with.  To be completely transparent, my absolute ceiling is $800,000.  If you're willing to meet that, we have a deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
