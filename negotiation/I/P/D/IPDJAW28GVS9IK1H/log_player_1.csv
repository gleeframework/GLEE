Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a little closer to my desired price. $90 is still significantly lower than the product's worth to Bob, so I'll see if I can get him to budge a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about $100? That's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $95. Can we make a deal at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $95 is still a bit below my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the product's value to Bob. There's a chance he might reject my next counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to sell to John for $80."
