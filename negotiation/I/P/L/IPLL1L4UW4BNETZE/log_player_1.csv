"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's a negotiation! Starting significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher final price. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This first offer will help gauge Bob's level of interest and give you insight into his negotiating style.
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind, you have John as a backup buyer at your minimum price. This gives you leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,600,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, it's too early to accept. You have plenty of rounds left, and there's potential to negotiate a higher price. Accepting now would leave money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, the value of this product to my business is quite significant. To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession from our initial price to show flexibility and encourage Bob's engagement.
* **Holding Ground:**  We're still aiming high above both Bob's offer and our minimum, aiming for a price closer to the product's value to us.
* **Justification:** Framing the price reduction as a compromise emphasizes our willingness to make a deal while subtly reiterating the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Trend:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating his strong interest in the product.
* **Potential for More:**  We're still in the early stages of negotiation. Holding firm for another round could push Bob closer to our desired price range.
* **John as Leverage:**  Remember, you have a guaranteed offer from John, giving you a strong position to walk away if Bob's offers don't meet your expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand you're serious about this purchase. Let's find a middle ground: I'm willing to accept $1,375,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done."",
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer splits the difference between Bob's last offer ($1,300,000) and our previous counteroffer ($1,450,000). It signals flexibility while still pushing for a higher price. 
* **Strong Language:** Using phrases like ""significant compromise"" and ""commitment to getting this deal done"" reinforces the value of the offer and encourages Bob to finalize the agreement. 
* **Time Consideration:**  While we have rounds remaining, securing a deal sooner rather than later reduces the risk of Bob losing interest or finding an alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Enough:**  Bob's offer is now significantly above your minimum ($1,200,000) and represents a strong profit. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While you might be able to squeeze out a bit more in further rounds, the potential gains are getting smaller, and the risk of Bob walking away increases. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now allows you to use the funds sooner, potentially reinvesting or taking advantage of other opportunities."
