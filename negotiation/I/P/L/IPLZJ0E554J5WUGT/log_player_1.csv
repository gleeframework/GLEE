Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. That's a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 85}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $80.  While I'd prefer to get a bit more, Bob's offers are getting too close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk him walking away completely. It's better to take the guaranteed $80 from John."
