Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $12,000 to you!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $10,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob has incentive to negotiate, but the offer is still attractive enough to him.
* **It sets the tone:** You're starting the negotiation with a confident, but not unreasonable, offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm trying to save as much money as I can. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is your minimum,  it's worth trying to get a better price from Bob.  You know he values the product at $12,000, so there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to save money, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000,  which is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $9,000. I'm willing to go up to $8,500. Can we meet there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is close to your minimum of $8,000, and it's likely that further negotiation won't get you a significantly higher price.  You're better off accepting his offer and securing the sale."
