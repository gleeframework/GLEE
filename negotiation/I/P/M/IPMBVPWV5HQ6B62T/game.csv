"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a lower price, and I get a quick sale. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $13,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit, but $13,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? That's a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,200, but that's my limit. Can you meet me there?",13200.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $13,200 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again - $13,400.  This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options.",13400.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but $13,400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,100, but that's my final offer. I really like the product and would like to make a deal with you, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $13,100?",13100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you about your budget constraints, but I can't go any lower than $13,300.  This is my very last offer. If you're serious about buying, I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",13300.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but $13,300 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,800, but that's my absolute limit. I really want to make a deal with you, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $12,800?",12800.0,Bob,8,
