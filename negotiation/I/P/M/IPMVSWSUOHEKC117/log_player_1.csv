"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming to leave room for negotiation while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $160 is a decent price, I'm still aiming for a bit higher. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a profit above my minimum. I'm confident that Bob will be motivated to close the deal since he's already shown interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $165 is getting closer to my desired price.  I'll accept his offer and secure the sale.  While I could try for a higher price, it's likely the negotiations will continue to go back and forth, and there's a chance I could end up selling to John for less."
