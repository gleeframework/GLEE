"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll take advantage of it!",180.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about $120?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $160. This is a great deal, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $135. That's a significant increase from my previous offer, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $135. I'm willing to meet you at $145, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. This is a great deal, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, but $145 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $140.  That's my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",140.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $140. I'm willing to meet you at $150, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. This is the best offer I can make, and I hope you'll consider it.",150.0,Alice,7,
