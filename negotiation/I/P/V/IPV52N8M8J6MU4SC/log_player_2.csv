Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $95, so how about we try $105? It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
