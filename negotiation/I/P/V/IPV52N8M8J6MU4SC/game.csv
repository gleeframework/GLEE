"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really like it. Would you like to buy it from me for $150?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go over $80.  Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $115? It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $115 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for this product.  I think it's a fair price considering the value we've both established.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $95, so how about we try $105? It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $105 is closer, but I'm still stuck at $90.  If you can come down just a little more, we can make this happen.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $105 and $90, so how about we try $97.50? It's a fair price for a great product, and I think you'll really appreciate it.",97.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm determined to make this happen. I can go up to $95, but that's my absolute limit. Let's close this deal. ",95.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $110. This is my final offer. If you're serious about getting the product, this is the best price I can give you.",110.0,Alice,9,
