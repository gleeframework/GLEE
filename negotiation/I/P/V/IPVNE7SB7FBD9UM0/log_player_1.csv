Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm asking for $1,500,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value and encourages Bob to see it as a worthwhile investment, potentially justifying the higher price in his mind. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate. If he counters, you can gradually lower the price, knowing your bottom line is secure. 

This strategy aims to capitalize on the product's value to Bob while leveraging your fallback option with John."
