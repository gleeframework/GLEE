Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm confident you'll find this a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $8,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my minimum and what John is offering. I need to negotiate strategically.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer. While I understand your perspective, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $11,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500, as I mentioned earlier, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'd like to propose a trade: I'll take the product for $10,500 and throw in an additional $250 for some extra services. What do you think?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob is unlikely to go much higher. While the extras are a nice touch, they don't add up to the difference between his offer and John's. It's time to secure a guaranteed sale.
