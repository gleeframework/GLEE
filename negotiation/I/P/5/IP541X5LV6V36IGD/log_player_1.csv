Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. Considering the value I place on the product, I am willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I reject Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is far too low for me.  I'm confident I can get a better price, either from Bob or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to make a higher profit to justify the sale. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,600,000 for the product. This still gives you a significant value for your investment."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my assessment, I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both parties involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,400,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hesitant to sell for less than my minimum of $1,500,000.  I'm hoping to secure a better deal with Bob in the next round, or I'll move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I value our ongoing negotiation and am willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to my minimum price.  How about $1,450,000? This still leaves a significant profit margin for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts in negotiating. Based on my calculations and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a final offer of $1,425,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum.  John is a sure thing, and I don't want to risk losing out on that deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
