"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think it's a fair price considering its value, but I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is your maximum price, it's always good to try and negotiate for a lower price.  Rejecting the initial offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this unique product. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I've made a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but also have a clear budget in mind. I've justified the price by framing it as a win-win for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the initial price, but I have to consider the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. I think this is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is within my budget and represents a good compromise.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she might become less flexible or I might run out of rounds. Accepting the offer at $11,000 is a good outcome, saving me $1,000."
