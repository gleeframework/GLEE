"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $17,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum but still potentially attractive to Bob.  Since the product is worth $15,000 to him, there's room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $16,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm offering $16,500. This is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more than $16,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $16,200 is a good price and it's getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds.  I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by continuing to counteroffer."
