"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think you'll find it very useful. I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I'd be willing to pay $120. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but $200 is my initial asking price.  Could you do $160? I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value you'll get out of it.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $120. It's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. How about we split the difference and settle at $140? That's me coming down $20 from my last offer.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $140 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $120. If you're not willing to go lower, I'm going to have to look at other options.",120.0,Bob,6,
