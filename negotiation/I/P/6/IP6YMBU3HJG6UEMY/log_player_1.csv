Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I'd be willing to pay $120. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but $200 is my initial asking price.  Could you do $160? I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value you'll get out of it."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $120. It's a fair price for both of us.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $140 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $120. If you're not willing to go lower, I'm going to have to look at other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob seems firm on his $120 offer and is even hinting at walking away.  It's unlikely he'll go much higher. Accepting his offer would be a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed $150.  It's time to cut bait and secure the sale with John."
