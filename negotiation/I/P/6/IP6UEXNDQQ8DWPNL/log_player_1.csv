{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than what the product is worth to me, but still within a reasonable range for Bob to consider.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than my minimum, it's still lower than what I'm hoping for. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $875,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's a price that's still higher than what the product is worth to me, but it's also closer to what Bob is willing to pay. I'm hoping this will be an acceptable price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $825,000 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll try to counteroffer once more and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}

I'm going to counteroffer with $850,000. This is a final compromise, bringing the price closer to Bob's latest offer.  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I will move on to sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $830,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $830,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've gone back and forth with Bob several times, but we haven't been able to reach a price that works for both of us.  Since I'm confident I can get $800,000 from John, I'm going to move on and sell the product to him."
