"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's worth a lot to me, but I believe you'll find it extremely valuable.  My initial offer is $900000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is below his maximum price, it's still higher than Alice's perceived value of the product.  There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  There are also 9 more rounds, so there's time to work towards a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product.  However,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction:** This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about negotiating and isn't afraid to make a substantial cut. 
* **Reasonable Starting Point:** $850,000 is still a good profit for Alice, and a significant saving for Bob. 
* **Open to Compromise:**  The message emphasizes a willingness to find ""common ground,"" keeping the door open for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While $850000 is a good offer, I need to stay closer to my initial price point. How about $875000? This would allow us both to benefit from this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price, even if it's closer to his initial counteroffer.
* **Time for More Compromise:** Alice's message indicates she's open to negotiation. There's room to push for a lower price. 
* **Potential for Improvement:**  With 7 rounds remaining, Bob has time to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $875,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's meet in the middle at $860,000. This feels like a fair compromise considering my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small But Significant Adjustment:** Bob is making a smaller counteroffer this time, showing he's willing to meet Alice halfway but still maintaining his negotiating stance.
* **Emphasizing Fair Compromise:**  The message highlights the $860,000 price as a ""fair compromise"" to reinforce the idea of reaching an agreement. 
* **Maintain Pressure:**  Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but in a way that encourages Alice to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to go down to $865000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of this product to both of us. Let's finalize this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $865,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $865,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in:** Alice's offer is now only $5,000 above Bob's counteroffer.  This indicates a strong likelihood that she's close to her lower limit.
* **Time Pressure:** With 5 rounds left, the risk of not finding a deal with Alice increases, potentially forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Saving Potential:** While not the ideal price, $865,000 still saves Bob $135,000 compared to buying from John. This is a significant saving and a worthwhile compromise."
