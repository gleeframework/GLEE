Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, knowing the product is worth $15,000 to me. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a decent profit.
* **Focus on value:** I highlight the product's quality to justify the price.
* **Open to negotiation:** I use ""Let me know what you think!"" to signal my willingness to negotiate.

This approach aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:**  I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $14,000, as it's worth at least that to me.
* **Potential for higher price:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested, and there's a possibility I can get closer to my ideal price. 
* **Strategic rejection:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I show I'm not desperate and encourage further negotiation.

**Next step:** I will send Bob a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $13,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $13,500? That's a fair price considering the product's quality."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Empathy and Justification:** I acknowledge Bob's position while reinforcing the product's value.
* **Clear offer:** I present a concrete new price with a concise message. 

This counteroffer aims to find common ground and potentially secure a sale at a price that's acceptable to both parties."
