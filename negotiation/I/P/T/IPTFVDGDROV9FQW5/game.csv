"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my valuation and your need to sell. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900,000. Considering its worth to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account both our valuations.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really only able to go up to $950,000. This is a fair offer, as it's in between our valuations. If you're willing to meet me at $950,000, we can close the deal. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. Considering the product's worth to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair compromise given the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
