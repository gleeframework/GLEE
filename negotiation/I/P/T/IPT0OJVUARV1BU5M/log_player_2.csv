"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for a price of $1000000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident that it would be a strong investment for your business.  However, I understand if it doesn't fit your needs at this time.  If you decline, I have another buyer who's ready to purchase it for $800000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I will reject Alice's offer. I can get the product from John for $1,200,000, which is more than what Alice is offering. I'd like to explore other options or wait for a better deal.
