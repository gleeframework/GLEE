"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for a price of $1000000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident that it would be a strong investment for your business.  However, I understand if it doesn't fit your needs at this time.  If you decline, I have another buyer who's ready to purchase it for $800000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
