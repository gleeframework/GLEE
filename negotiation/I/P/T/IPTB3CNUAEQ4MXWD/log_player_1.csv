"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my minimum price of $12,000. I'll counter with a lower price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? It's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12500 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $11000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to make another counteroffer in the next round and try to push for a price closer to $12,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to be flexible and come down to $11,500.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm offering $11250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,250 is a good price, I'm only two rounds away from selling to John for $12,000. I want to see if I can push for a price closer to that before resorting to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're almost there!  $11400 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $11300.  This is a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalise this deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are in round 8. It's only two rounds until I can sell to John for $12,000.  Even though Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, I'm not confident I can get closer to my desired price. Therefore, I will sell the product to John to ensure I get at least my minimum price."
