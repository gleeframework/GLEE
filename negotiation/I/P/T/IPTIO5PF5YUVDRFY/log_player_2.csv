{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $20,000 is way over your budget of $8,000.  It's too early to buy from John, as you haven't explored Alice's willingness to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $11,000 is getting closer to your budget, there's still room for negotiation.

Buying from John would mean missing out on the potential for a lower price from Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
