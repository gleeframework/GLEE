"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9000.  It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can get the product from John for $8,000, so you have room to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in your product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8250?  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $8,250 is closer to your budget than Alice's initial offer, John is still offering a better deal at $8,000. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice, especially since there's a guaranteed option available."
