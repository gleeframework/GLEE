"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $500,000 is too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but I'm still finding it a bit high.  Would you be willing to do $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still not satisfied with the price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $725,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.",725000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit. How about $650,000?  That's a significant price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you are.",650000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your limit, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $725,000 and $650,000, which would be $687,500. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",687500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we are getting close.  I'd be willing to meet you at $675,000 and not a penny more.  Let's close this out.",675000.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $675,000. I'm willing to meet you at $700,000, which is the lowest I can go. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",700000.0,Alice,9,
