"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
