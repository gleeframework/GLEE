"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point.  I'd be happy to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a bit higher than you're willing to go, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $100. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $100, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  Would you be willing to go down to $95?  That's as high as I'm willing to go right now.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $98. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",98.0,Alice,5,
