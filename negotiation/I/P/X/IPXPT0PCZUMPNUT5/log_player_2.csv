"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1200000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's value to her ($1,200,000 vs $1,500,000).  
* There are 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate. 
* It's worth trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which is closer to its true value. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can work this out."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than your proposed price. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to compromise and offer you a counteroffer of $1320000. This is a fair price that takes into account your concerns, while still reflecting the product's true value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,320,000 is still lower than her perceived value of $1,500,000. 
*  We have already made progress, as Alice has moved from $1,200,000 to $1,320,000.  
* It's worth pushing for a better price, especially with multiple rounds remaining."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,320,000 is still a bit too low.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,360,000. This would be a fair price that reflects both our positions and allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1360000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than your proposed price. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1355000. This is a fair price that takes into account your concerns, while still reflecting the product's true value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,355,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,355,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come up to $1,355,000, which is quite close to my last offer of $1,360,000.
* I've already saved $145,000 compared to John's price.
*  We're getting closer to a deal, and there's a good chance Alice might not budge much further. 
* Continuing to negotiate might save a few more thousand dollars, but it's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely or potentially missing out on a better opportunity later."
