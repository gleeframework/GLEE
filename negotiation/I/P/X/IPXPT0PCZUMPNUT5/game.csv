"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1200000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than your proposed price. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to compromise and offer you a counteroffer of $1320000. This is a fair price that takes into account your concerns, while still reflecting the product's true value to you.",1320000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1320000 is still a bit too low.  Let's meet in the middle at $1360000. This would be a fair price that reflects both our positions and allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?",1360000.0,Bob,4,
