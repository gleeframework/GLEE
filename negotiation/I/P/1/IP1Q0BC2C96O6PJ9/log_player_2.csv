"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I'm confident you'll love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you is $15,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to make it work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is lower than your maximum price, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. Since you know John is willing to sell for $15,000, you have some leverage. Alice might come back with a lower price to avoid losing the sale."
