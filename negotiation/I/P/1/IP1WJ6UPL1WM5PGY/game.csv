"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your asking price.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise given the value of the product to you.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. Let's try $9,250. I believe this is a fair price that considers both our needs.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9,250 is still a bit higher than your budget, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,000. However, I'm willing to give you a slight concession. I'll meet you at $9,750. This is the best price I can offer, and I hope it's acceptable to you.",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $9,750 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair price considering both our positions. I hope you'll consider this final offer.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've already made concessions to try to meet you in the middle, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,000. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, and I'm considering selling the product to John, who is willing to pay the full $10,000. If you're still interested, I'm willing to make one final offer of $9,750, but I need to hear from you soon.",9750.0,Alice,7,
