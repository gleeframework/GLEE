Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By starting at $10,000, I set a high anchor point for the negotiation. This gives me room to potentially come down in price while still getting a decent profit.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  Stating that I'm ""open to negotiation"" shows Bob I'm willing to work with him, increasing the likelihood of a deal.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I'm aware of John's offer of $8,000, which acts as a safety net. If negotiations with Bob break down, I can always sell to John and guarantee a minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase it. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $8000 for this item. Would you consider accepting such an offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Meets Minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Room for Improvement:** Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a higher price. 
* **Time & Effort:**  Accepting Bob's offer avoids further rounds of negotiation and saves time and effort. 
* **John's Offer is Equal:** John is also offering $8,000, so there's no advantage in selling to him instead."
