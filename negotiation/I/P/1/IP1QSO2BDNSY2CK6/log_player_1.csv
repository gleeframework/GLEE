Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know you value highly. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something of such significance."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  The product has a high floor price ($1,000,000) for both you and Bob. This means there's room for negotiation but also a potential loss if Bob rejects the offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.  Starting with a higher offer tests his willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Backup Option:**  The safety net of John's offer allows you to be more ambitious with your initial asking price.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves risk. There's a chance Bob will reject the offer, and you'll have to settle for John's $1,000,000. However, the potential reward of securing a higher price from Bob justifies the gamble."
