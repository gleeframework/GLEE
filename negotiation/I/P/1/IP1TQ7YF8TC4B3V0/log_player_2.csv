"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $820,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the value it can bring to your business.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still hesitant, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $800,000. That's the minimum I'm willing to accept for this product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer it to you for $810,000. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to you and the value it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $800,000. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John at $800,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to yield a better price and risks missing out on John's guaranteed offer."
