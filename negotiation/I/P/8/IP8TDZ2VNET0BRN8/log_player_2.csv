"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $1,500,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have another option with John. Rejecting Alice's offer might push her to propose a lower price, closer to her own valuation of $1,200,000. You're willing to risk getting the product for a higher price from John to potentially save a significant amount."
