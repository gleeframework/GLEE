# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

At this point, Alice has made it clear she's unwilling to meet your $800,000 limit. There's no guarantee further negotiation will get you a better price, and you risk losing the opportunity to buy from John at your target price."
