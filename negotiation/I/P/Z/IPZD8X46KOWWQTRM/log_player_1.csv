Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since I know Bob values the product at $8,000, I want to start with a higher offer to explore if he's willing to pay a premium.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $10,000 offer leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob rejects the offer."
