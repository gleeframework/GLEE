"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your business. It's truly one-of-a-kind.  To kick things off, I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's a negotiation tactic to begin with a price higher than your desired outcome. This gives you room to negotiate and creates the perception of value. 
* **Justification:**  While the price is high, vaguely mentioning the unique value to Bob's business provides a slight justification beyond simply stating a number.
* **Leaving Room:** I am starting significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving plenty of room to go down over subsequent rounds, should he counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing it, but I need to be mindful of our company's budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but accepting now would leave a lot of money on the table. I'm confident I can get closer to at least $1,100,000 before needing to consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand budget constraints, but the value of this product is undeniable.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I significantly decreased my initial asking price to demonstrate a willingness to negotiate.
* **Hold Firm:** I'm still aiming for a price well above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum.
* **Justification:** By saying ""meet in the middle"", I'm framing it as a fair compromise, even though it's still skewed in my favor. 
* **Urgency:**  While I didn't explicitly mention John, Bob knows I have other options, adding subtle pressure to his decision-making."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget with your latest offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so how about $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above John's Offer:** Bob's offer is now $25,000 higher than what John is guaranteed to pay.  
* **Strong Position:** While I could potentially push for more, there's a risk Bob will walk away. Accepting now secures a significant profit.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now, rather than dragging it out further, has its own value."
