"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm confident that its worth is well above $800000, but I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us. I'm proposing a price of $1000000. This gives you a significant opportunity for potential profit. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
