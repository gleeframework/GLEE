Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your needs. I'm asking for $1,190,000.  Let me know your thoughts and if you'd like to discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, I want to see if Bob will pay a price closer to that.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering just below my guaranteed price leaves a small margin for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still ensuring I get a great deal.
* **Strong but Not Greedy:**  Asking for $1,190,000 shows I'm serious about selling and am aiming for a price that reflects the product's value, but I'm not being overly aggressive."
