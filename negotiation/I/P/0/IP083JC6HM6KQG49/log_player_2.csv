"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Bob's desired price of $12,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,500.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired sale price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $12,500.  It's important for me to get a fair price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? This is a good compromise, and it allows for a smooth transaction.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,250 is still higher than Bob's desired price of $12,000.  While it's a compromise, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since John is offering the product for Bob's target price of $12,000, it makes sense for Bob to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
