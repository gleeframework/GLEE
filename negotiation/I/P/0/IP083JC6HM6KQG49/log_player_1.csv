Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate but still leaves you with a decent profit.
* **It's below your minimum price:** You're not giving away the product for less than your minimum.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** The negotiation can progress from here, giving you a chance to either increase your profit or accept a slightly lower price.

Remember, you can always go to John if Bob rejects your offer. This gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,500.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired sale price. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $15,000. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum. I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $12,500.  It's important for me to get a fair price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? This is a good compromise, and it allows for a smooth transaction.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13250}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** This shows Bob you're willing to negotiate, but you're also firm on your minimum. 
* **Meet in the middle:** By offering $13,250, you're halfway between your previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($12,500).
* **Positive phrasing:** The message is phrased in a way that emphasizes a ""good compromise"" and a ""smooth transaction,"" making the offer more appealing to Bob."
