Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate without feeling like he's being taken advantage of.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still making a profit, and there's potential to get closer to your desired price.
* **It's a clear and direct offer:** This allows Bob to respond quickly and easily.

By starting with this offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and see if you can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Remember, you always have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to your minimum than Bob's initial offer, it's still a bit lower than what you're aiming for.  You have the option to sell to John for $15,000, so it's worth exploring if you can get closer to that with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $13,500.  This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to still make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is firm on his $13,000 offer, and while it's tempting to continue negotiating, the risk of going lower and lower outweighs the potential gain.  Selling to John guarantees you the $15,000, which is your minimum and a safer option than risking further negotiation with Bob."
