Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price that is closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $150. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my desired range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm offering a price of $160, which is still above my minimum acceptable value but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while maintaining a price that's closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140

This is the best offer Bob has made so far, and it's above my minimum acceptable value of $150.  I'm accepting the offer to secure the sale and maximize my profit."
