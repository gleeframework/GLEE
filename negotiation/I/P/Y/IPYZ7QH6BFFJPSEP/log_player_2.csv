"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an exclusive price. Given its value and quality, we believe it's worth more than what you'd find elsewhere. Considering its worth to you is $100, I propose to offer it to you for $95. This is a great opportunity to secure a high-quality item at a reasonable discount. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.
