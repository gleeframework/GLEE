Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe would be a great asset for you. I'm asking for $18,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation and secure a good deal. I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I believe $15000 would be a fair price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility and encourage further negotiation. However, I'm still above my minimum, leaving some room for a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I think $15500 would be a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $15,500 is a good price, and it's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  I don't want to risk losing a deal and getting stuck with the lower offer from John."
