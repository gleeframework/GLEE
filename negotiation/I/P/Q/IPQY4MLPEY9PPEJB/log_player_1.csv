Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a time-sensitive offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high.  A price of $1,450,000 aims to capture some of the value the product holds for Bob while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting that this is an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a sense of urgency and potential value in Bob's mind. 
* **Time sensitivity:**  Putting a gentle time pressure on Bob encourages a quicker decision.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** This strategy assumes you have no prior information about Bob's negotiating style. If you know he's particularly averse to high starting prices, a slightly lower offer might be more strategic. 
* **Relationship:** If building a long-term relationship with Bob is important, a less aggressive starting price could be beneficial."
