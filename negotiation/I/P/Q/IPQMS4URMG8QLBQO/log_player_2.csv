"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming to save a significant amount.  He's offering $1,000,000, which is still within his budget, but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This will test Alice's willingness to negotiate and hopefully push her towards a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, but there's still room for improvement. Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open for a potentially better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate strategically. He's increasing his counteroffer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise.  $1,025,000 is a reasonable midpoint between his previous offer and Alice's current offer, making it a more enticing deal for Alice while still allowing Bob to save a significant amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob would like to continue negotiating, Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is approaching his maximum willingness to pay.  At this point, it's wiser for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product.  Further negotiation could lead to a lower price but also risks losing the deal altogether. Buying from John would be more expensive, and the offer from Alice is a good compromise that allows Bob to save a significant amount."
