``` 

This offer starts high, but it's important to remember that I can always lower it later. By starting high, I give myself room to negotiate and potentially earn more. I'm also framing the offer as an exclusive opportunity, hoping to pique Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. I am willing to pay $1500000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above that price point.  Considering the unique value and potential of this product, I'd be willing to come down to $1,750,000.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired amount.  I'm also emphasizing the product's unique value to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I'm glad we're finding common ground. I would like to propose a price of $1600000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is closer to my desired price and still significantly higher than John's offer.  It's a good deal that I'm happy to accept."
