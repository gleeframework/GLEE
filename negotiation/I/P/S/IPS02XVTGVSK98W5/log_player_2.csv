"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are aiming to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, you can likely get it for less.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Offering $10,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer. This shows your willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for a potential compromise.  It's a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is a good price, considering your maximum budget is $15,000.  It's a significant saving compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate might save you a little more, but the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially driving the price up again is not worth it.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal."
