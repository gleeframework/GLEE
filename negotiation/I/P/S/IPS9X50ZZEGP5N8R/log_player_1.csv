Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights and I wouldn't offer it to just anyone.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit beyond our minimum.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The message emphasizes exclusivity and value perception, potentially making the price more palatable to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The price is negotiable. If Bob counters, we have room to decrease slightly while still staying above our minimum acceptable price.

This approach balances securing a good deal with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
