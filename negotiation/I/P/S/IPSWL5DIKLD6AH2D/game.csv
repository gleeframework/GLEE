"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product.  However, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows at this time.  I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price considering your cost and my need to remain within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. This product holds immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $875,000. This is a good compromise that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  It seems we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle at $887,500? This represents a fair deal for both of us.",887500.0,Alice,5,
