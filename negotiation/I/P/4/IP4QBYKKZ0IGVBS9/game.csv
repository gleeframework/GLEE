"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,500 for it.  What do you think?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you do $7,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $7,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $9,500. I think it's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $9,500 is still pushing it for me.  I'm willing to offer $8,000. That's the absolute maximum I can justify for this purchase.   Let me know if you're open to it.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. Let's try $9,250. I think this is as close as I can get to your offer while still meeting my minimum price. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,7,
