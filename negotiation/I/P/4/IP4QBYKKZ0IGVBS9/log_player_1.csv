Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,500 for it.  What do you think?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you do $7,500? I think that's a fair compromise.
