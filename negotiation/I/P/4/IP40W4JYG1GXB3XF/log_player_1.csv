Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000. Let me know if you're interested, as I have other potential buyers lined up."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning ""other potential buyers"" creates a sense of urgency, making Bob less likely to stall or lowball you.
* **Value Justification:** While I don't explicitly state why the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, the message implies that I believe it holds significant value beyond even my minimum.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize profit:**  If Bob accepts the $15,000, you earn a significant profit.
2. **Secure a fair price:** If Bob negotiates, you have room to lower the price while still staying above your $12,000 minimum.
3. **Avoid losing out:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a guaranteed backup buyer at your minimum acceptable price."
