"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives us bargaining room and allows us to gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be.
* **Polite and Professional:**  We maintain a polite and professional tone to encourage a positive negotiation process. 
* **Expressing Interest:**  We reiterate our interest in the product to signal that we are a serious buyer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! However, $10,000 is too low for me. How about we split the difference at $12,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Great Deal:** Alice meeting us at $12,000 is a fantastic deal. It's the price she values the product at, meaning we're getting it for what it's worth to her. 
* **Saving Money:** This price is also $3,000 less than John's offer and $2,000 less than her initial offer.  
* **Time Saved:** Accepting now avoids further negotiation rounds and secures the product."
