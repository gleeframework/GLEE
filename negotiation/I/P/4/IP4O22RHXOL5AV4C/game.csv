"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a significant discount while still allowing me to make a profit.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to reduce the price to $950,000. This still allows you to acquire the product at a significant discount, and it gives me a reasonable profit. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've given this some thought, and I'd like to counter your offer with $925,000. This still keeps my investment within my desired range while providing you with a good profit margin.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $925,000 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $940,000, which is a good compromise that allows both of us to benefit.  Let's close this deal!",940000.0,Alice,5,
