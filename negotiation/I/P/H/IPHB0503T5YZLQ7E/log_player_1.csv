Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to consider $13,000? I think that's a fair price that would be mutually beneficial.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
