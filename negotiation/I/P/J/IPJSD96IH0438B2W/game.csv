"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would still be a worthwhile purchase for you. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
