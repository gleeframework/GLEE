"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested but $150 is a bit high for me.  How about $100?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do $135, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?  It's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite willing to meet you at $120, Bob. I was thinking more along the lines of $130. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",130.0,Alice,5,
