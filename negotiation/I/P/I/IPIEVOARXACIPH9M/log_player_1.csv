"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and open to discussion.  This should hopefully make Bob more receptive to the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than what the product is worth to me. I'm confident that I can get a better price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $9,000 for this.  Let's keep talking."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground. By dropping my price slightly, I'm showing willingness to compromise.  But I'm still keeping it above Bob's offer, demonstrating that I value the product and won't accept anything too low.  I'm also keeping the conversation open, hoping to find a price we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for that price.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer, and if that doesn't work, I'll sell to John.  I'm confident I can get a better deal than $8,500 with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm willing to go down to $9,500.  This is the best I can do. If you're serious about this product, let's finalize this. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price again, but it's still above Bob's offer. I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, hoping to push Bob to accept.  I'm also adding a touch of urgency, reminding him that we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, but no more. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. We're getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds, and I don't think I'll be able to get a better deal with Bob. It's time to move on and take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
