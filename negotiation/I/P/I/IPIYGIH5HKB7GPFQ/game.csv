"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand $60 is low, Alice. How about meeting halfway at $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 still isn't quite right for me. I'm willing to come down to $85, which is a fair compromise, don't you think?  Let's see if we can reach an agreement this time.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle on $80? That's my final offer.",80.0,Bob,6,
