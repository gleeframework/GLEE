Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** You're aiming for much more than your floor price of $800,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** By offering $1,200,000, you're still leaving a substantial profit margin for Bob, making the deal attractive.
* **It sets the stage for a balanced negotiation:** This initial offer establishes a clear starting point for back and forth, allowing you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is a good price, I'm still aiming higher. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

This counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to meet him halfway, but still maintaining a good profit margin for myself."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is approaching my minimum, I'm not willing to settle yet.  I believe I can still get a better deal, and rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation alive."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This time, I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price,  I've gone through several rounds of negotiation and it seems like this is the best deal I can get from Bob.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations that might lead to a lower price, or even a failed deal. I also don't want to risk losing the deal completely and having to settle with John for the lower price of $800,000."
