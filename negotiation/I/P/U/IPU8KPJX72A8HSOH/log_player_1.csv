{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $11,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my target price. I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. $9,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $10,000?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd still prefer a slightly higher price, $9,500 is a good compromise and gets me closer to my target. I'm confident I won't find a better deal elsewhere, and I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer."
