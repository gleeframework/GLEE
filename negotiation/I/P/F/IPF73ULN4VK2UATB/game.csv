"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about we split the difference and go with $125? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $125 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $137.50?  That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's make this deal happen!",137.5,Alice,3,
