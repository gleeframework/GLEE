"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is too low. The product is worth significantly more to you than that. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? This gives you a good deal, and ensures I get a fair price for my product.",775000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to negotiate further, but $740,000 is still too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to accept $760,000. This price reflects the product's worth and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",760000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob,  $750,000 is still a bit below what I need.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $755,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if you're able to accept this.",755000.0,Alice,7,
