"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's worth to you.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm prepared to pay $500,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $550,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",550000.0,Alice,3,
