{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This initial offer allows for a few rounds of negotiation, giving me a chance to understand Bob's willingness to pay. 
* **Protecting My Minimum:** I'm aware that John is willing to pay $15,000, so I'm not willing to go below my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Building Rapport:** A friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for a Counteroffer:** I can still make a counteroffer and potentially reach a compromise with Bob. 
* **Protecting My Value:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean losing out on a significant amount of money, especially since John is ready to pay my minimum. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer to try and bridge the gap."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I can't go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about $11,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering $11,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $11,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and closer to my minimum.
* **Showing Flexibility:** My message demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests. 
* **Encouraging Agreement:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, hoping to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $10,250 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point of $15,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can potentially push for a higher price.
* **John's Offer:** John is willing to pay $15,000, so I have a strong backup option if negotiations with Bob fall through.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a slightly lower price but still above my minimum, to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,250.  How about we split the difference this time and go with $10,750?  It's a good compromise for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising, but Not Too Much:**  I'm offering $10,750, which is halfway between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $10,250. This shows flexibility without significantly compromising my bottom line.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $10,750 is still above my minimum of $15,000, so I'm not losing out on a substantial amount of money.
* **Creating Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the need to reach a compromise, suggesting that this could be the last offer before I move on to John.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and positive tone to keep the negotiations moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $10,375? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,375 is still significantly below my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  The negotiations have been going on for a while, and there's limited room for further compromise without significantly impacting my profit. 
* **John's Offer:** John is willing to pay my minimum, which guarantees me a much better deal than what Bob is offering.

At this point, it makes more sense to sell the product to John and secure a more favorable price. While I'm disappointed that negotiations with Bob didn't work out, it's important to prioritize my financial interests."
