"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I can't go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about $11,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can we meet in the middle at $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,250.  How about we split the difference this time and go with $10,750?  It's a good compromise for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $10,375?",10375.0,Bob,6,
