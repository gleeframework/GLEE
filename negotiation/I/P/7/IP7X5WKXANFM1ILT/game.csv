,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about $175?  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",175.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob. I can do $180, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to make a deal with you at that price.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $180 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to pay $165.  That's the absolute most I can do.",165.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you really want this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll do $170. That's the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",170.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to get this product, but $170 is still a little too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $168, and I think that's a fair compromise. If you can meet me there, we can make a deal.",168.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $168, but I'd like to add a small premium for the hassle of negotiating with you. I'll do $169, and that's my final offer.",169.0,Alice,7,
