,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $90. How about we meet at $95? That's as high as I'm willing to go.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $95 is still a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $100.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
