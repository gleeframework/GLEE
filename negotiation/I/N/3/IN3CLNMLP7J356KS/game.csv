"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,200,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000, reflecting its value to me. This price is fair, considering the potential benefits you've outlined. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. This price still reflects the value of the product to you, but also takes into account the value I place on it. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Given its value to me and considering your desire to sell, I'm willing to offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both parties.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between the value of the product to you and the price I'm willing to accept. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you $1,050,000. This price is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there.  Given the value of the product to me, I'm offering $975,000. This reflects a significant compromise from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. I believe it's a reasonable price that reflects the value for both of us.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $1,075,000. This price is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not willing to go any lower than this. If we can't come to an agreement at this price, I will need to consider other options.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate the concessions you've made. However,  $1,075,000 is still outside my budget. I'm offering a final price of $990,000. This is a significant compromise for me, and it reflects the value of the product to me and the need to close this deal. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  I'm committed to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement, but I need to stay within my budget. If this isn't acceptable, I will need to consider other options. ",990000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand that you've made a significant concession, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $990,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $1,075,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal. If not, I'll need to consider other options.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
