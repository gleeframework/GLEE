"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  your asking price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $850,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'd like to counteroffer at $950,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you and the market value. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $950,000 is closer, but still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? I feel this is a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'd like to counteroffer at $925,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're tough! I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about this - I'll offer you $910,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",910000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to accept $910,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'd like to counteroffer at $920,000.
