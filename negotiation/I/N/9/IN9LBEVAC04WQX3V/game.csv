,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is the maximum I can afford. Can you consider this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,500, but I'm still unable to go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $10,250.  This price is still a great deal for both of us, and it's the absolute lowest I can go. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
