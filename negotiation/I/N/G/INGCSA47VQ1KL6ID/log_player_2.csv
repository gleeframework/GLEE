It's always beneficial to try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better deal from Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's about 22% lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal and hopefully prompts her to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $800,000 is a good deal, I'm still aiming for a lower price. It's worth seeing if I can get Alice to come down further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 775000}

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $825,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to save more. I have a few rounds left, so I'll see if I can squeeze a little more out of Alice before turning to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm now offering $800,000. This is a big jump from my previous offer, but still a significant saving compared to Alice's latest offer. It's possible Alice might be willing to close the deal at this point, as we're nearing the end of the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's getting close to the end of the negotiation, and Alice's offer hasn't come down as much as I'd hoped.  At this point, I'm only one round away from having to buy from John.  To avoid potentially being stuck with a price I'm not happy with, I'll take John's offer and secure the product."
