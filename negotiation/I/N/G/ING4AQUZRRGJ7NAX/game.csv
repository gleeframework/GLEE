"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $10,500 is lower than my initial price, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $12,000? This would still give you a substantial benefit, and it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Alice,3,
