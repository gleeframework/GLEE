"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to meet your needs and enhance your daily life. I believe it's worth more than its face value of $120, but let's start our negotiation at $150. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice is willing to come down, and you can save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $125. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's more appealing to me while still leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. After considering your offer, I've decided to counter with $140. This is my best offer for now. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $150 to $140, which shows she's willing to negotiate.  I still think I can get a better deal, so I'll reject her offer and try to counter again.  It's worth risking another round to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $125."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $140, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about $135? I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a smaller reduction this time, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still pushing for a better price. This should signal that I'm serious about buying the product and am not just trying to haggle for the lowest price possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. Considering your proposal, I would like to counter with $137.50. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $137.50, which is only $2.50 away from my last counteroffer. This is a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk going another round and potentially having Alice raise the price again. It's worth accepting this offer to secure the product at a good price."
