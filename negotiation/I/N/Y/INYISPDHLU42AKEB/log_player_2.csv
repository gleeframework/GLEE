"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500.  It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her initial value of $12,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. 

Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer, potentially lowering the price further.  It's a strategic move to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a little high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000.  This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. While it's closer than her initial offer, Bob has a better option. 

Buying from John for $10,000 guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
