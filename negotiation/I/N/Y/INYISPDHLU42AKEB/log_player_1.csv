Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a little high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price, but it's close.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him closer to my price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
