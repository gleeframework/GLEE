"Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product that aligns perfectly with your needs.  I'm confident it will be worth significantly more than the price I'm offering. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This represents a substantial gain for you, and it allows me to earn a fair price for this unique asset.  Let me know your thoughts. ",1400000.0,Alice,1,
