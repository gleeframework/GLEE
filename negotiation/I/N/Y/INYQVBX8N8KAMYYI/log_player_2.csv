"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it would be even more valuable to you. I'm starting at $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. He wants to save as much money as possible and there are still 9 rounds to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to be aggressive in the first counteroffer. He knows the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice and is hoping to get a deal close to that value.  He's also highlighting the fairness of his offer by considering the value to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,100,000 is a good starting point, I'm still quite a bit away from my minimum. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This reflects the value the product holds for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price but still above his target. He's still aiming for a lower price and with 7 rounds left, there's room to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially close the deal at a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's try to bridge the gap and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's moved slightly from his previous offer of $1,100,000, showing a willingness to compromise. He's also reiterating the fairness of his offer and emphasizing the need to close the deal."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer! I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,175,000.  This price reflects the value the product holds for both of us, and it's a significant compromise on my end. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,175,000, which is very close to Bob's desired price but he's still hoping to save even more. With 5 rounds remaining, there's still room to negotiate and potentially reach a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to close the deal at a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. I'm willing to go to $1,160,000, which is a substantial compromise from my previous offer. This price is a fair reflection of the product's value for both of us. Let's finalize this deal now."", ""product_price"": 1160000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to close the gap. He's raised his offer slightly from $1,150,000 to $1,160,000, showing willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal. He's also emphasizing the fairness of his offer and urging Alice to finalize the deal. This is a strategic move to try and secure a favorable price before the pressure of limited rounds starts to affect negotiations."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're almost there.  I understand your position and I'm willing to meet you at $1,165,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us. Let's seal this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,165,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,165,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,165,000, which is just $5,000 above Bob's most recent offer. With only 3 rounds remaining, the pressure to close the deal is increasing.  It's unlikely that Bob will be able to get a lower price with so few rounds remaining.  Accepting the offer ensures that he gets the product at a good price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a significantly higher price."
