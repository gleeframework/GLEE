"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,000. I know it's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe this price reflects its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

While $11,000 is lower than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. This might lead her to propose a lower price in a counter-offer. If not, you can always fall back on buying from John for $12,000."
