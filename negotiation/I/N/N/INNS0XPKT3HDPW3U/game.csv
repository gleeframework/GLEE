"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This price still gives you a great value and allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price that's closer to my budget and still allows you to make a good profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,500 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,000, which reflects a fair compromise for both of us.  This price allows me to stay within my desired range while still offering you a good deal.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us very close to a deal. Let's see if we can make it happen.",9800.0,Bob,6,
