Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit. I'm offering the product to you for $12,000.  Let's find a price we're both happy with."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12000 is still outside my budget. I'm firm on $8000, which is the absolute maximum I can pay. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Bob seems determined to pay only $8,000, and I'm not willing to go that low.  John is a safe bet at $10,000."
