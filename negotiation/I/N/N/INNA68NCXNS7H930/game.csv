"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to go down to $130? I'm really interested in this product and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're interested in the product, and I appreciate you making a counteroffer. While $130 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for it. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $135? Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",135.0,Alice,3,
