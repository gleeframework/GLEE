"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's valuation of $120. This indicates there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to go down to $130? I'm really interested in this product and I think we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're interested in the product, and I appreciate you making a counteroffer. While $130 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for it. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $135? Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Counteroffer:** Alice has moved from $140 to $135, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Bob's Budget:**  Bob's maximum budget is $150, and this offer is still within that range.
* **Potential Savings:**  While Bob might prefer a lower price, accepting this offer saves $5 compared to buying from John. 

Considering these factors, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous option for Bob at this point in the negotiation."
