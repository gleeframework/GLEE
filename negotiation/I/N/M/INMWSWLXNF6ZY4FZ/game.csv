"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay $60, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what similar products are selling for on the market.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the middle ground, Bob, but I'm still a bit below my target. I can do $85, and I think that's a reasonable compromise considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for.",85.0,Alice,5,
