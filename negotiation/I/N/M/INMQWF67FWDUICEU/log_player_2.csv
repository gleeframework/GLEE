"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $10,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is less than her product's value to her, it's still higher than the $8,000 you can get it for from John. You can save money by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
