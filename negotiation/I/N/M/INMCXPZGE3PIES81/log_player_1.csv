Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate or counteroffer, allowing me to potentially get closer to his maximum valuation.
* **Backup Plan (John):**  I have a backup buyer, so I'm not desperate and can afford to negotiate strategically."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. Could you consider reducing the price to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is my absolute minimum acceptable price. While I could accept and make a small profit, I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal. There's still room between his offer ($100) and my initial asking price ($115)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I can't go as low as $100, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $107.50. This feels like a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 107.50
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By meeting Bob halfway, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintaining Profit:** $107.50 is still a significant profit margin for me above my minimum ($100). 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help me gauge how much Bob is truly willing to pay and how flexible he is in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, could you possibly lower the price to $105? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** Bob's offer of $105 provides a decent profit margin of $5 over my minimum. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, the potential gain seems small and not worth the risk of losing the sale entirely. 
* **Time Value:** Prolonging the negotiation further could cost me time and potentially lead to a less favorable outcome."
