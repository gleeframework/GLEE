"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product, in terms of its potential and unique advantages, is significantly higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has unique advantages, but I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the sweet spot. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value here, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a point we can both agree on. How about $1,275,000?  This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your position.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,275,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,6,
