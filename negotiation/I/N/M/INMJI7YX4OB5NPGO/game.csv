"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly beyond my budget. Given my maximum spending limit, I'd be willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation considering the value I place on it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the product's value to you.  However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true worth and potential of what I'm offering. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This takes into account the unique benefits and scarcity of this product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product has unique value, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my acceptable range.  To reach a compromise, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This reflects a significant step towards your price, and demonstrates my strong interest in acquiring this product.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
