"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $90 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice since the product is worth less to her than it is to you.  You can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $90 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
