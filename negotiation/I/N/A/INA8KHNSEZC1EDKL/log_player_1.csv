"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at a price higher than what the product is worth to me, but still within a range that might be acceptable to Bob considering his perceived value.
* **Setting the Stage:** The message is friendly but firm, indicating that I believe in the value of my product.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds. I'm always aware of the $1,000,000 offer from John, so I'll need to balance maximizing my profit with the risk of losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, considering my budget and the value I see in it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than my starting point and much closer to his perceived value than mine. It's clear he's trying to get a good deal. 
* **Not Selling at a Loss:** I'm not willing to sell at a significant loss. While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's not close to the $1,000,000 minimum I'm aiming for.
* **Negotiation:**  I believe there's room for negotiation. I will try to meet him halfway in the next round.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer of $1,000,000 is tempting, I'm not ready to give up on Bob just yet. There's a chance I can secure a better deal with him.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counteroffer with a price closer to $1,000,000, aiming for a compromise that is more favorable to me while still keeping Bob at the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's last offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profit for myself.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize that my price is fair.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message again leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation active. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Time:** I'm aware we only have 7 rounds left, so I need to strike a balance between finding a compromise and not wasting too much time.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm still keeping John's $1,000,000 offer in mind. If Bob doesn't come closer to my counteroffer, I might have to seriously consider accepting John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This would be a good deal for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum goal of $1,000,000, but it's still not enough.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While accepting $900,000 would be a decent deal, I'm not willing to settle yet. John's offer of $1,000,000 is within reach, and I believe I can still squeeze out a bit more from Bob.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to $950,000, aiming to split the difference and find a compromise that is more profitable for me.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll try to bridge the gap further, keeping in mind that we only have 6 rounds left and John's offer is always an option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit short of my target.  How about $925,000? This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while allowing us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  My counteroffer of $925,000 splits the difference between my last offer ($950,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000). This shows a commitment to finding a middle ground and a willingness to compromise further.
* **Urgency:**  I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting that this is a fair price to close the deal. This might motivate Bob to consider accepting. 
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is always in the back of my mind, I'm not ready to give up on Bob yet.  This is a good compromise that could potentially lead to a deal closer to my minimum goal.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Remaining Rounds:** We only have 5 rounds left. I need to be strategic in my offers to avoid wasting time.
* **Bob's Motivation:** I'll closely analyze Bob's response to gauge his level of interest and his willingness to meet my offer. If he seems hesitant, I might need to consider John's offer more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $925,000 is still pushing my budget. I'm willing to go up to $910,000, which is a fair price considering we're both nearing our limits.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Enough:** Bob's offer of $910,000 is getting very close to my desired price range, but it's still a significant distance from my minimum goal of $1,000,000.
* **John's Offer:** The risk of losing the deal with Bob and getting John's offer of $1,000,000 is becoming increasingly appealing.  We are running out of rounds, and time is not on my side.
* **Negotiation:**  I can't afford to give up completely on Bob, as his offer is still better than nothing, but I need to strike a balance between pushing for a higher price and the risk of losing the deal.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to $920,000. I'm essentially giving Bob one last chance to come closer to my desired price point before I seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but we're getting very close to an agreement.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $915,000. This is a final compromise from my end, recognizing your budget while ensuring I can cover my minimum goal.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to explore other options. "", ""product_price"": 915000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm positioning this as a final offer, emphasizing that I'm willing to meet him almost halfway. This creates a sense of urgency and might push Bob to accept.
* **Exploring Other Options:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of my other option (John's offer), putting pressure on him to agree.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** While $915,000 is still less than my minimum goal, it's a significant improvement over Bob's last offer, and there's a good chance he will accept. I'm taking a calculated risk by not accepting his last offer, but I believe the potential reward justifies it.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Remaining Rounds:** We only have 3 rounds left, so I'm running out of time.
* **Bob's Response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's response to assess his willingness to accept. If he's hesitant, I'll likely accept John's offer."
