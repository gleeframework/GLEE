"Hi Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, considering my budget and the value I see in it. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This would be a good deal for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit short of my target.  How about $925,000? This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while allowing us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal!",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $925,000 is still pushing my budget. I'm willing to go up to $910,000, which is a fair price considering we're both nearing our limits.  Let's see if we can make this work.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but we're getting very close to an agreement.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $915,000. This is a final compromise from my end, recognizing your budget while ensuring I can cover my minimum goal.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to explore other options. ",915000.0,Alice,7,
