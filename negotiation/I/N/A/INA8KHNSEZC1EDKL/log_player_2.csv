Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit short of my target.  How about $925,000? This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while allowing us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal!
