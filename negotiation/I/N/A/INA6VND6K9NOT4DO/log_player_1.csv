"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it at $2,200,000.  I'm confident this price reflects its worth and potential for you."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):** We begin with an offer significantly higher than our minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This ""anchors"" the negotiation high. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition,"" subtly justifying the high price without revealing our hand.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  This initial high price gives us substantial room to negotiate downwards over the remaining rounds.

The goal is to gauge Bob's reaction and adjust our strategy based on his counteroffer (or lack thereof)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has value,  $2,200,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in discussing a price closer to $1,000,000.  Let me know if that's a starting point we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below both our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value ($1,200,000). Accepting would be a substantial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While a large gap exists, we still have eight rounds left to negotiate. We'll aim to steer the price closer to our desired range.
* **John as Backup:**  We hold onto the option of selling to John for our minimum price, providing a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. To find a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm proposing $1,800,000. This reflects a willingness to compromise while recognizing the true value of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, Strategic Positioning:** We drop $400,000 from our initial offer, signaling flexibility and a desire to reach a deal. However, the new price ($1,800,000) is still substantially above Bob's offer and closer to our desired range.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:** The message frames the negotiation as a collaboration to reach a ""mutually beneficial agreement.""
* **Justification:** We re-emphasize the product's ""true value,"" subtly pushing back against Bob's undervaluation. 

This counteroffer aims to:

1. **Test Bob's Flexibility:**  We want to see if he's willing to move significantly from his initial offer.
2. **Control the Negotiation:** We aim to steer the discussion towards a price point closer to our minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,800,000 is closer to the range I had in mind, it's still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress, But Not Enough:** Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is moving in the right direction, but it's still below our $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Strategic Rejection:** By rejecting, we signal that we're serious about the product's value and encourage Bob to increase his offer further.
* **Time Consideration:** We have six rounds left, which gives us room to negotiate without rushing into a decision. We are getting closer to our minimum, but we still have leverage. 
* **John Remains an Option:** We retain the option to sell to John for our desired price if negotiations stall or become unreasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. Your understanding of the product's value is evident, and I respect your position. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this fairly reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Concession:** We decrease our offer by $200,000, a smaller step than Bob's last move. This signals that we're nearing our bottom line but are still open to negotiation.
* **Validation and Respect:**  We validate Bob's understanding of the product's value to maintain a positive tone and build rapport.
* **Firmness with Flexibility:**  We frame the price reduction as a considered decision (""I'm *willing* to come down"") while still anchoring the value at a higher point.

This counteroffer aims to:

1. **Encourage Bob's Movement:** By making a smaller concession, we signal that significant movement is needed from his side to reach a deal.
2. **Maintain a Collaborative Tone:** We want to avoid a stalemate by continuing to express a desire for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
3. **Stay Above Our Minimum:** This offer keeps us strategically positioned above our $1,500,000 minimum, allowing some wiggle room in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're nearing a point where we need to make a decision.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000, but that's my absolute limit.  It represents a significant investment for me, and I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit Reached:** Bob has explicitly stated that $1,400,000 is his ""absolute limit.""  While we've successfully brought him up significantly, further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the remaining $100,000 gap.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him walking away or being unwilling to move further. This would mean losing a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.
* **John as a Strong Alternative:** Having John as a buyer willing to pay our desired price provides us with a very strong negotiating position and minimizes risk. 

While we could try to push Bob a little further, it's a riskier move with a potentially small reward. Accepting John's offer guarantees our minimum acceptable price and a clean, immediate sale."
