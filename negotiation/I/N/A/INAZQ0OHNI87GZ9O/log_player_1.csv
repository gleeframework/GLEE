Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given the value of the product to you, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a decent price, I'm aiming for a higher profit. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product to both of us, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,100,000? This gives you a great deal while still allowing me to achieve a reasonable profit. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. I've given this some thought and believe we can find a middle ground. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product to both parties and allows for a fair transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $1,050,000 is a good price, and it's closer to my initial goal. It's better than selling to John for $1,000,000, and we've reached a fair agreement after a few rounds of negotiation."
