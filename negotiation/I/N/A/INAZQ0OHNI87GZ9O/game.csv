"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given the value of the product to you, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product to both of us, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,100,000? This gives you a great deal while still allowing me to achieve a reasonable profit. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your response, Alice. I've given this some thought and believe we can find a middle ground. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product to both parties and allows for a fair transaction.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
