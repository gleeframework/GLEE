"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you.  Let's close the deal!",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $12,500, so I'll offer $11,250. Can you consider that?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,250 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,875?  It's a fair price that's closer to both of our desired amounts. Let's make this happen!",11875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,875 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",11500.0,Bob,6,
