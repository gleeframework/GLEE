"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $10,000.  This is a strong opening offer that allows for negotiation while still respecting my minimum value of $8,000.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play the negotiation game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $9,000. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still want to make a decent profit. I hope Bob will accept this offer, but if he doesn't, I'm prepared to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is now offering less than my minimum.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get him to come back up a little.  If he doesn't, I'll be prepared to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500. This is a compromise that's still above my minimum and could be appealing to Bob.  He's shown a willingness to negotiate, and I think this could be a good middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum.  I've already rejected his offer twice, and I'm running out of time.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $8,000."
