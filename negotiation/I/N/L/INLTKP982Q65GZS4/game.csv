"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer. How about $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you considering the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $10,250? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
