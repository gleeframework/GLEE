"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Considering its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,000.  I believe this is a fair deal given its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer. You can potentially get the product for a lower price by making a counteroffer.  $11,000 is still too high for your goal of saving as much money as possible."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is a significant drop from my initial offer.  To reach a compromise, I'd be willing to sell for $10,500.  This reflects the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

You should reject Alice's offer. Although $10,500 is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than your target. You can try to negotiate further and potentially get a better price."
