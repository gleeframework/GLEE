"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're beginning with a price significantly higher than our minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly mentions openness to discussion, signaling to Bob that we're willing to negotiate. 
* **Justification:** While the price is high, we're not giving a specific reason for it yet.  This allows us to adjust our justification based on Bob's reaction in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to make a more substantial saving. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise that benefits both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has correctly identified our minimum acceptable price, which puts us in a tough spot. However, settling for $1,200,000 at this stage leaves potential profit on the table. We still have ample rounds to negotiate, and selling to John is our guaranteed backup. By rejecting, we signal that we're aiming for a higher price and are willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, I believe the product's inherent value and potential benefits warrant a higher price point.  Would you consider $1,450,000?"" , 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're lowering our price significantly from $1,600,000 to $1,450,000, showing Bob we're willing to negotiate. However, this is still substantially above both his offer and our minimum.
* **Justification:** We're hinting at the ""inherent value and potential benefits"" without being too specific, leaving room for Bob to justify a higher price to himself. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will help gauge how much further Bob is willing to go. We're aiming for a sweet spot between maximizing profit and keeping him engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to make a significant saving. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to compromise further. I'd like to propose a price of $1,100,000. This is a more reasonable price point that still reflects the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering less than our minimum acceptable price. While he's trying to position it as a ""compromise,"" it's clear he's aiming for a deal that heavily favors him. We need to stand firm to signal we won't accept a price below our minimum. We're still safe with our option to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your current offer falls significantly below the product's true worth.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.  However, I value our discussions and believe this product would be a great asset to you.  My final offer is $1,350,000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial ask and reflects my desire to close this deal."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness & Urgency:** We're communicating that this is our final offer and implying we're serious about the other buyer (John). This creates a sense of urgency for Bob to act.
* **Justification:** We're emphasizing the ""significant reduction"" to make our offer seem more appealing in contrast to our previous price.
* **Final Push:** We're still aiming for a price above our minimum but showing some flexibility. This round will likely determine if Bob is willing to move closer to our range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you have another buyer interested, but I'm still willing to make a deal. Considering your initial offer was $1,600,000 and your current offer is $1,350,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to propose a price of $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value and your desire to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is above our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While we could push for more in the remaining rounds, there's a risk:

* **Bob might walk away:** He's consistently aimed for a lower price and might be reaching his limit. 
* **Time is a factor:** We have fewer rounds left, and there's no guarantee we'll reach a better deal with Bob.

Accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids the potential loss of selling to John at our minimum price."
