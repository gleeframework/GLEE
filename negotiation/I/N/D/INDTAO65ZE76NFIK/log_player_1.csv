"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This initial offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. It also shows confidence in the product's worth. This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate while still leaving you with a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum goal of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I can't go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make this deal work.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit and reflects the true value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering the value of your product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to my goal, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm not desperate for a sale and still believe there's room for negotiation. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still not comfortable going below $11,250. This is a significant compromise on my end, but it's the closest I can come right now.  Let's try to bridge the gap and reach an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $11,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for a slightly better deal.  There are only 4 rounds left, so I need to be careful about rejecting offers too quickly. However, I think I can still push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I'm willing to come down to $11,100. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope we can finalize the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $11,050. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,050
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, there's not enough time to negotiate further.  While $11,050 is close to my goal, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit and ensures a successful transaction."
