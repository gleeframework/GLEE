Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects its value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise that benefits both of us.
