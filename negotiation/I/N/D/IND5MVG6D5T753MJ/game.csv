"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course, but I believe this reflects a fair starting point considering the significant benefits it offers.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I'm looking to make a more significant saving. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects its value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to compromise further, but I think we can find a better middle ground. How about we meet at $975,000? This is still a significant discount from your initial offer, but I'm willing to make a serious commitment to the product if we can agree on a price.",975000.0,Bob,4,
