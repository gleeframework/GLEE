"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering how much you value the product at $15,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly aware you value the product, and her starting price leaves a significant gap between her valuation and yours. By rejecting this offer, you open the door for a potential counter-offer closer to a price you're both comfortable with."
