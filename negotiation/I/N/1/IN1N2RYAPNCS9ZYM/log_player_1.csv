Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows Bob values the product, just not as much as she does. By starting with an offer above Bob's valuation, she leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Close to Bob's Limit:** The offer of $11,500 is close enough to Bob's $10,000 valuation that he might consider it, especially if the product is something he needs or wants. 
* **Backup Plan:** Alice is safe knowing she has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John if Bob rejects the offer. This allows her to be a bit bolder."
