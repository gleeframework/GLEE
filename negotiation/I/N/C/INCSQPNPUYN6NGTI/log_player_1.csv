Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $140 is a good starting point. It's a price that's still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($100) but might tempt him if he's interested.  
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might reject this offer. However, it's worth trying to secure a higher price before accepting the guaranteed $150 from John."
