Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is important to you, but my budget is quite limited. Could we perhaps aim for a price closer to $15,000? I'm willing to negotiate and find a fair price that suits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm not going to sell for the minimum price right away. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate. While your offer is tempting, I'm not quite ready to sell for that price yet. I'm willing to come down to $16,500.  This reflects the value of the product to me, and hopefully, it's also a fair price for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, could we possibly meet somewhere around $15,500? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's only $500 less than John's offer and it's getting closer to my minimum. I'm confident that I'll be able to get a better price from someone else in the future."
