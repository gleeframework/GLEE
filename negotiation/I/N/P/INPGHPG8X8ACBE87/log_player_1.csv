Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're still significantly above John's offer, so there's room for negotiation.  We need to bring Bob closer to our desired price point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to ensure this deal reflects the true value of the product. Let's settle on $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** This counteroffer conveys a sense of firmness while still demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic positioning:** By stating it's our final offer, we incentivize Bob to seriously consider it rather than continuing to lowball. 
* **Time constraint:** As we progress through the rounds, highlighting the value of time and a secured deal becomes increasingly important."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,050,000 is getting closer to my budget. I'm willing to pay $980,000 for it, which is my best offer so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant profit:** $980,000 is a substantial profit margin, exceeding John's offer by $180,000. 
* **Diminishing returns:** While we could push for more, Bob's increments are getting smaller. It's unlikely we'll gain significantly more in subsequent rounds.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** By continuing to negotiate, we risk Bob walking away or significantly lowering his offer.  

Taking this offer secures a great price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
