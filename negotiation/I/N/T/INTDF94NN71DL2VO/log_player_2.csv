# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have other potential buyers lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's significantly higher than his maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for $10,000."
