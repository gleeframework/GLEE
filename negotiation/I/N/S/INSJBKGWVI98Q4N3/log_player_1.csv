Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $13,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel more inclined to engage.
* **Value Emphasis:** I subtly emphasize the product's value to Bob by stating ""I think you'd be really interested in it."" 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $12,000 from John gives me the confidence to be firm in my negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay $12,000 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer is exactly at my minimum acceptable price. However, since I started the negotiation at $13,000, I have some room to maneuver. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher, as I believe he might be willing to pay more. 
* **No Immediate Need:** I have a guaranteed $12,000 from John, so there's no urgency to accept Bob's offer immediately. 
* **Strategy:** By rejecting, I can test the waters and see if I can secure a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which reflects the product's true value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm sticking to my plan of trying to get a slightly higher price.  
* **Reasonable Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by reducing my initial price by $500, showing flexibility.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reiterate that $12,500 is a fair price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and respectful tone to encourage Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still unable to exceed $12,000 for the product. Could we meet at $12,250? I believe this price respects the product's value while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $12,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **No Further Room:** I've already lowered my price twice, and it's unlikely Bob will go higher.
* **Time is Money:** Further negotiation might be time-consuming and unlikely to yield a significantly higher price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a profit of $250, which is better than selling to John for $12,000. 

It's important to balance maximizing profit with the efficiency of the negotiation process. In this case, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice."
