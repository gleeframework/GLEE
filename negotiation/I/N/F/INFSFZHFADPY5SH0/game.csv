"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but $105 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $127.50? I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",127.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $127.50 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $115. This is a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll come down to $122.50. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",122.5,Alice,5,
