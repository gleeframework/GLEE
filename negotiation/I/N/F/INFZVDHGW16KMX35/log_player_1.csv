Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is higher than Bob's value but lower than your minimum. This allows for some negotiation space while still ensuring you make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to find a price closer to $90. I'd like to make a counteroffer at $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is a profit, it's still significantly lower than the $120 you could get from John. It's worth trying to negotiate with Bob further to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $105? Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $120 from John is a better deal, it's worth considering the time and effort involved in selling to John.  $100 from Bob is still a profit, and it's likely Bob won't budge further.  It's a reasonable compromise."
