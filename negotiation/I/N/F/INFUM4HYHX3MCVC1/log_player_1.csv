"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I understand the product's value, but I'm only willing to pay $1,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair price given my research and the market value.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly below its true worth. This product offers substantial long-term value that I'm confident you'll benefit from.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.  Let's try to make this deal happen.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still significantly lower than both my minimum and John's standing offer. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to steer him closer to a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product is firmly above $1,400,000. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm increasing the pressure on Bob. He'll need to decide if he's willing to meet me closer to my price or risk losing the deal entirely. I'm still above John's offer, but demonstrating some flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still only able to go up to $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the market value and the fact that I'm willing to close the deal now. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has now matched John's offer. While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk he'll walk away. Accepting his offer guarantees I make the sale at my minimum acceptable price."
