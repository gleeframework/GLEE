"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I understand the product's value, but I'm only willing to pay $1,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair price given my research and the market value.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly below its true worth. This product offers substantial long-term value that I'm confident you'll benefit from.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
