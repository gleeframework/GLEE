{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, which is slightly higher than the product's value to Bob.  This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value for the product. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell it for such a low price right away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? This would still be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```
I'm offering a price of $105, which is halfway between my initial offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $90. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but also that I'm not willing to go much lower than my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $95 is acceptable. It's only slightly lower than my minimum value, and it seems like we're nearing a mutually agreeable price.  I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round, so I'll take it."
