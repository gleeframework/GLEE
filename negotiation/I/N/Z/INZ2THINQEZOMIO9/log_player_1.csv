"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. It's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $110 is better than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer. I believe there's still room to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counteroffering at $130. This is a compromise from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. I hope this shows my willingness to negotiate while also demonstrating the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's a slight improvement over his previous offer, it's still significantly below my initial offer and counteroffer. I believe there's still room to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to my desired price.  I don't want to rush into a deal that leaves me feeling like I under-sold the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $125. This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway.  Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to make a final move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get a bit closer to my initial price, I'm accepting Bob's offer of $120. We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  $120 is a good profit margin for me, and I'm confident I can find another buyer in the future if I need to sell another similar product."
