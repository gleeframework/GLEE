Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $150. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum value of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I'll be ready to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not satisfied with that. I'm going to try and get closer to my original offer of $150. I will counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, while still getting a better price than Bob's initial offer.  Hopefully, this will lead to a quick and mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is just above my minimum acceptable price and I'm not sure I'll get a better offer.  I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
