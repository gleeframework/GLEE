"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",180.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that price is a little steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only justify spending around $80. Would that be something you'd consider?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a little closer, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $130. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,
