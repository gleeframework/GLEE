"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum, I aim to anchor the negotiation higher. This might make Bob's counteroffers more favorable to me. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** I'm fully aware that $2,000,000 is a high starting point. However, this leaves ample room for negotiation over the remaining rounds.
* **Signaling Value:** The high initial price also subtly communicates the product's high value, potentially influencing Bob's perception."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price and his own perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.  While I anticipated a lower counteroffer, this is too drastic to accept. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal over the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is quite a way from what I have in mind. To move this forward, how about we consider $1,600,000? This reflects the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** I've made a significant reduction from my initial offer to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, the new price is still comfortably above both Bob's offer and my absolute minimum.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""true value"" of the product, I'm subtly reminding Bob of its worth and why my price is justified.
* **Guiding the Negotiation:** My goal is to slowly guide the negotiation towards a price point that works for both of us. This counteroffer keeps us moving in that direction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I recognize the value, I need to stay within a reasonable budget. How about $1,000,000? That's my best offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now offered his true perceived value of the product. While this is a significant jump from his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to push him a bit more. Accepting his ""best offer"" at this stage is premature."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget.  I'm trying to find a solution that works for both of us. Let's meet in the middle – how about $1,300,000?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm signaling a willingness to compromise by proposing a price exactly halfway between our last two offers. This shows Bob I'm taking his budget into account and am genuinely interested in finding a solution.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** Importantly, this price is still well above my absolute minimum of $1,500,000, giving me some room to potentially negotiate down slightly further if needed.
* **Encouraging Agreement:** By framing it as ""meeting in the middle,"" I'm nudging Bob towards a collaborative mindset and hopefully encouraging him to accept this offer or propose something closer to my range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer! I can tell we both want to make this deal happen.  How about we settle at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now getting into the later rounds of the negotiation. While Bob is definitely warming up to the idea of a higher price, $1,100,000 is still too far below my minimum. I need to hold firm and signal that I'm not going to drastically drop below my previous offer. There's a chance Bob will come up to $1,200,000, which would be a more acceptable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we are getting close! I appreciate you moving closer to my position. To be frank, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to accept.  How about we make this the final push – $1,250,000, and we have a deal?"",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm making it clear that I'm not willing to go as low as his previous offer, but I'm still offering a compromise. 
* **Creating Urgency:** By calling it the ""final push"" and implying this is my last offer, I'm introducing a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to make a decision.
* **Strategic Concession:** The $1,250,000 price is strategically chosen. It's a concession from my previous offer, but still above my absolute minimum, leaving a small buffer for a potential final counter from Bob."
