Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again, closing the gap between my offer and Alice's. This shows my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good price. With only four rounds remaining, I need to find a balance between pushing for a lower price and potentially losing the deal."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and while I'd like to get it lower, Alice's offer is very close to my last counteroffer. Accepting this offer secures the product for a price within my budget and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether or having to buy from John at a significantly higher price."
