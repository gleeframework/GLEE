"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a budget in mind. I could go up to $9,500, but that's my limit.  It's a fair offer considering John is offering the same for $10,000.",9500.0,Bob,4,
