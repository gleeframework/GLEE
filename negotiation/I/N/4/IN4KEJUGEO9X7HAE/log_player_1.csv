Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price, especially since I have 8 more rounds to negotiate.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not going to accept it yet. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, aiming for a higher price. I still have 6 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,500,000.

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum, but with only 4 rounds left, I'm taking the risk out of the equation. I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000, ensuring I get my minimum value."
