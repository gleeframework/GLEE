"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget considerations, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This product truly offers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your investment.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $16,000, but I don't think I can go any higher than that.",16000.0,Bob,4,
