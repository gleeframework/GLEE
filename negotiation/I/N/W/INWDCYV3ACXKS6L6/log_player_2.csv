You can do better than $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point to see if she's willing to come down."

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows you're willing to meet her halfway, but still trying to save some money."

Alice is coming down in price, but I'm still not ready to accept. I can likely get a better price if I continue negotiating."

This counteroffer is closer to Alice's latest offer, showing you're getting serious about buying the product. It leaves some room for negotiation, but it also signals that you're willing to close the deal at a price that's still within your budget."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

Alice is not willing to budge much lower, and at this point, it's starting to feel like a losing negotiation. Buying from John for $15,000 is still within my budget, and it's quicker and less stressful than continuing this back and forth."
