Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the initial price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $900,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is inching up, but slowly. We're still significantly above his perceived value and have room to negotiate down while staying above his $800,000 valuation. The risk of going to John is that we lose this negotiation progress."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, $980,000 is a significant profit and very close to our last counter-offer.  Continuing to push risks Bob walking away, leaving us with the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.  Taking the sure win at this point is strategically sound."
