"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $15,000. Bob can do better than that. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $15,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500 for the product. This is a great compromise, considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?

Bob is still better off buying from John for $12,000 than accepting Alice's offer of $13,500.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Bob is better off buying from John for $12,000. Alice is offering $13,000, which is still higher than Bob's maximum budget. There is no point in continuing the negotiation, as Alice is unlikely to go any lower, and John is offering the product at a price Bob can afford."
