{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This gives me more leverage in the initial stages.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale with John for $15,000, I can be more aggressive with Bob and less worried about losing the deal entirely.
* **Room for negotiation:**  $12,000 is a good starting point that leaves room for potential counteroffers and a final price that is still profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's a step in the right direction, $9,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept a price this low without trying to get a better deal.
* **John as a backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me the confidence to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me some wiggle room."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  By offering $10,500, I'm making a significant concession from my initial offer of $12,000, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Reasonable counteroffer:**  This price is still above Bob's offer, but it's closer to his range and might be tempting enough for him to accept.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:**  If Bob still rejects, I can consider going lower, but I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $10000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **No guarantee of a better offer:** While I could try to push for a higher price, there's no guarantee Bob will budge further, and I might risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could take longer, and I might be able to sell to John in the meantime, but there's no guarantee. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that is within my acceptable range and ensures a relatively quick transaction."
