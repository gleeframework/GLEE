"Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a fair price considering its worth to you is $80, and I'm willing to make a slight profit. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me at $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $82.50. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you is $80. What do you think?",82.5,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $75. Would you be willing to meet me at $75? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a good middle ground.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I can offer it to you for $79. This is a compromise that still gives me a reasonable profit, considering the product's value to you is $80. What do you think?",79.0,Alice,5,
