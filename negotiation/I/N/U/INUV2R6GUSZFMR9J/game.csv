,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product but would only be able to pay $1000000.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on this price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount from my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1400000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1400000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000, which is closer to my budget and a fair price for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $1100000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time at $1300000. This is a very good price for the product, and I think you'll find it a great value.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm still not quite there with $1300000.  How about $1150000?  This is a fair price for the value of the product, and it's within my budget.  I'm confident we can close this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, $1150000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1250000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're nearly there. I'm willing to go to $1225000, which is a fair compromise for both of us. I'm confident this is a price we can both agree on and finalize the deal.",1225000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1225000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get as close to my target as possible. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1350000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident it's the best we can do.",1350000.0,Alice,9,
