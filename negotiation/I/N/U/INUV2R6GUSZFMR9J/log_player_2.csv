# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $1100000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time at $1300000. This is a very good price for the product, and I think you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I'm still not quite there with $1,300,000.  How about $1,150,000?  This is a fair price for the value of the product, and it's within my budget.  I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, $1150000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1250000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're nearly there. I'm willing to go to $1,225,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us. I'm confident this is a price we can both agree on and finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1225000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1225000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get as close to my target as possible. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1350000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident it's the best we can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's final offer of $1,350,000 is still above Bob's limit. Since he only has one round left, it's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially ending up with a higher price. Buying from John at $1,200,000 is the most sensible option."
