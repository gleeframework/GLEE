``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common strategy in negotiations to leave room for bargaining.  I'm also keeping the message positive and friendly to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $8,500. This is a compromise that is closer to my desired price, but also gives Bob some room to negotiate.  I'm also reinforcing the value of the product to keep him motivated."
