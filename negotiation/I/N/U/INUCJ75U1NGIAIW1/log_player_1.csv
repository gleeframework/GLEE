Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it.  I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $90, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm open to negotiation, and this initial offer sets the stage for a potential counteroffer from Bob.

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** Starting higher gives me a better chance of getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Test the waters:**  Bob's reaction will tell me if I need to adjust my strategy. If he immediately rejects, I might have to lower the price quickly.
* **Keep John as a backup:**  If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can still sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $75 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob, as he's shown interest. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I have the option to sell to John for $100 if negotiations fail. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to reach a mutually agreeable price. This gives me a better chance of maximizing my profits."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $75 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $85.  This would still be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I reiterate that the product will be a good deal for Bob.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message encourages further negotiation and invites Bob to respond.

By offering $85, I'm trying to:

* **Find a middle ground:** It's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  A counteroffer shows I'm serious about selling to Bob.
* **Maintain my position:** I'm not giving in completely, showing that I'm confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I've already found another seller who is willing to sell it to me for this price, so I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $80 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for lost deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, he might go with the other seller, and I would be left with only John's offer of $100.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate might take longer, and John's offer is a sure thing. 

While I'd prefer to get closer to $100, accepting Bob's offer ensures I make a sale and get a reasonable price without risking losing the deal altogether."
