"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price seems quite high to me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,400,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I can offer $700,000.  I need to be mindful of my budget.  Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. Let's try this - $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects my desire to find a deal that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
