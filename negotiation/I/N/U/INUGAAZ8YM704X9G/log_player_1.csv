Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $14,000, which is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and direct, emphasizing the value of the product to Bob. This helps build a positive relationship and encourages him to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while still leaving space for negotiation. By starting with a high offer, I can potentially secure a good price.  However, if Bob rejects, I can always lower the price if necessary. The ability to sell to John for $10,000 gives me a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, it's still lower than my desired price. Since I have the option of selling to John for $10,000, there's no rush to accept Bob's offer.  By rejecting, I can continue negotiating with Bob and try to reach a price closer to my target.

**Strategy:**

* **Counter-offer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer, ideally closer to $13,000.
* **Leverage:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer gives me leverage in the negotiations. I don't have to settle for a price I'm not comfortable with.
* **Flexibility:**  By maintaining flexibility, I keep the potential for a better deal open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me.  Considering the value this product holds for you, I'd be willing to come down to $12,500.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm offering $12,500, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer but still above my minimum price.  
* **Reasoning:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, suggesting that the compromise is in his best interest.
* **Call to action:** The message ends with a call to action, urging Bob to accept and close the deal.

**Strategy:**

By making a counter-offer, I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate while also demonstrating my value proposition. This strategy aims to reach a mutually agreeable price while maintaining a respectful and collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to $12,500, Alice.  How about we settle at $11,750?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,750 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but more importantly, it's a fair compromise. It demonstrates that he's willing to negotiate and that we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. Accepting this offer means I can secure a sale without risking a potential stalemate or having to sell to John for a lower price. 

**Strategy:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer is a good middle ground, allowing me to secure a sale at a price that's reasonable. 
* **Time-saving:**  Continuing negotiations could take more time and might not result in a significantly higher price.
* **Securing a sale:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
