"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum price of $100.
* **Rejecting the offer keeps options open.** It allows you to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** If you can't get a lower price from Alice, you can always go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $90 right now. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is within your budget:** $90 is still below your maximum price of $100.
* **Reasonable starting point:** It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing you're serious about negotiating.
* **Positive tone:** The message expresses your interest in the product while clearly stating your price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $90 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more for this product.  How about $93? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's closer to your preferred price, you can likely still get it lower. 
* **Continuing to negotiate is worthwhile.**  You've already shown willingness to compromise, and Alice seems open to negotiation as well.
* **Buying from John is still a backup.** You can always go with John if you can't reach an agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $93 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $92. This is my final offer, as I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 92} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** Stating this is your final offer adds pressure and incentivizes Alice to consider your offer seriously.
* **Small increase:**  The counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise but still trying to save money. 
* **Emphasis on budget:** Reinforcing the budget constraint makes your position clear."
