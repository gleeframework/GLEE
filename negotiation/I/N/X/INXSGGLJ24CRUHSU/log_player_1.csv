{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
It's not worth selling to Bob for $5,000 when I can get $15,000 from John. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial price. How about $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500

$6,500 is still too low for me. I'm not ready to give up on negotiating a better price with Bob, and I have some rounds left."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $6,500 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value you place on the product.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 8000}
