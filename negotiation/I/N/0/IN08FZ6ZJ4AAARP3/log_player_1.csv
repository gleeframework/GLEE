{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation and get as close to my desired price as possible.  I'm also highlighting the value of the product to make the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking of offering $120 for the product. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's still above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, increasing the likelihood of a deal. I also emphasize the value for Bob to further encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. While $140 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price with Bob's offer of $130, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm confident that John will pay my minimum price of $150, which is a better deal for me."
