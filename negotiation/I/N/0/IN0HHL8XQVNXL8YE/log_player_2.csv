"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together. I'm willing to offer you the product for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product but $100 is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price?"", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $85. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget, Alice.  How about $75?  That's a fair compromise between our two positions."", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not comfortable with $75, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product for $90. It's a good compromise, considering the value I'm bringing to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to go below $85.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $80, it makes more sense to take that deal and save the extra money."
