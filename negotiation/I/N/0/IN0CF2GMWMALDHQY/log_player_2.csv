"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let you have it for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $150 for the product, and Alice is offering it for $120. While this is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation to try and save some money.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $120 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $100?  I'm really interested in the product, and this price would make it a great deal for me."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I've already discounted the price to $120 and you're asking for another $20 off. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has met you halfway by dropping the price to $110. This is still a good deal for you, as you are willing to pay up to $150. Accepting this offer saves you $40 compared to buying from John. While you could continue to negotiate, the potential savings are small and the risk of Alice rejecting your offer and you having to buy from John at a higher price is present."
