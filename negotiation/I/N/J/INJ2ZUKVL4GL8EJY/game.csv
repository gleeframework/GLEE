"I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000?  It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll offer $950,000. Can you consider this compromise?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's aim for a win-win.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it ensures we both get a good deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
