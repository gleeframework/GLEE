"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and quality, we believe it's worth $12,000. We're confident this investment will pay off for you in the long run. Let's discuss how we can make this opportunity work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay $12,000 for the product and John is selling it at that price, there's no point in negotiating with Alice. You can save time and effort by buying from John."
