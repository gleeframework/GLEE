{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but $80 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $105.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 105}

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.
