{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth the price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. I'm hoping to get as close to my ideal price of $10,000 as possible while also leaving room for negotiation. I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option if the negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum price of $10,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I'll keep John in mind as a backup option if negotiations with Bob break down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? I'm sure we can both agree on that."", ""product_price"": 9750} 
```

I'm trying to find a price that's fair to both of us. I'm hoping to get closer to my target price of $10,000, but I'm also willing to compromise a bit to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but I still believe there might be room for negotiation. I would like to propose a price of $9,600 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell for closer to my ideal $10,000, $9,600 is still a good price, especially considering Bob is a potential buyer. It's better to secure a sale than continue negotiating with the risk of losing Bob entirely and having to settle for John's offer of $10,000."
