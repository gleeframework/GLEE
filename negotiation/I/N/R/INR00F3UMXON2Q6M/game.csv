"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree there's value in the product, $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $600,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still reflects the significant value of the product and leaves room for you to profit. I believe this is a fair compromise, let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  I'm still interested but $900,000 is a bit of a stretch.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the compromise you're showing.  While $750,000 is still a bit below my target, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $850,000. This price acknowledges the value of the product for you and gives us both a good outcome. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is close, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $780,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the value and keeps us both happy.",780000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $820,000. This is a good price for both of us, allowing you a solid return on investment while ensuring I get a fair value for my product. I'm confident we can reach a deal if we work together.
