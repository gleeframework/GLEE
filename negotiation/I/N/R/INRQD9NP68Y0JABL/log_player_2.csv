Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $200 is already a significant discount on this product. How about we meet in the middle at $155? It's a win-win!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. $150 is my absolute bottom line for this product.  I can't go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has stated $150 is her bottom line.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to result in a price I'm willing to pay. Buying from John guarantees I get the product at my target price of $100."
