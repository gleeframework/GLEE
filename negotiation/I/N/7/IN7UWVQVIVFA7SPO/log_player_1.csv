Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $140.  This leaves room for negotiation, but is still above my minimum price of $100. I'm confident Bob will see this as a good deal given the product is worth $150 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still willing to hold out for a higher price. I'll counter with a lower offer, but one that still keeps me above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm offering $135. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeps me above my minimum. I hope Bob will see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, and I'm confident that I won't get a better offer in the next round.  I'll accept his offer to avoid the risk of having to sell to John at a much lower price."
