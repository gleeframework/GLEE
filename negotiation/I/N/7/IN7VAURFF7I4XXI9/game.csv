"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $9,500 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a little more. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? This would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to walk away satisfied. Let me know what you think!",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $9,800? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my limits.",9800.0,Bob,4,
