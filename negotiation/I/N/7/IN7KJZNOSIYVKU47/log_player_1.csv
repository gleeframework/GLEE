Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. I'm asking for $1,200,000. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have room to start high.  A price of $1,200,000 gives you a significant potential profit margin. 
* **Gauging interest:** This high offer allows you to gauge Bob's level of interest. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he rejects, you can always negotiate down or move on to John.
* **Confidence:**  The message projects confidence in the product's value, potentially influencing Bob's perception. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you have some time and are willing to potentially negotiate with Bob. 
* If you need to sell quickly, a lower offer closer to $800,000 might be more practical."
