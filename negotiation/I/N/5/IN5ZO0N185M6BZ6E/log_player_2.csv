"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. Given its exceptional value and quality, we believe it's worth more than $12,000 to you. However, I understand that sometimes, finding the right price point can be challenging. Therefore, I am offering you the opportunity to acquire this product for $11,000. This price not only represents a significant saving for you but also allows us to fairly compensate for the investment and value we've put into creating this product. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice's offer of $11,000 is lower than John's $12,000.
* **The offer is within Bob's budget:** Bob is willing to spend up to $12,000, and Alice's offer is below that.

Therefore, it makes sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer to save $1,000."
