Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product but can only offer $10,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair starting point considering my budget and the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $19,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $12,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in the product. I believe this price reflects the value of the product to me while acknowledging your needs.

{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that.  While $12,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's say $17,000, and we have a deal."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $14,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I have a guaranteed offer from John at that price. It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale."
