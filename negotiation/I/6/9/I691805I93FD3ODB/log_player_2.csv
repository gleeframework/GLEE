"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I believe it's a fair starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $22,000 is far above my maximum budget of $10,000.  It's too risky to accept at this stage, as I'm confident I can negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting allows me to start the counter-offering process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product but can only offer $10,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair starting point considering my budget and the value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. To make this work, I can come down to $19,000.  This reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $19,000 is still significantly more than my maximum budget of $10,000. I'm determined to get the best price possible and am confident I can negotiate further. Rejecting allows me to continue the counter-offering process and potentially reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $19,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $12,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in the product. I believe this price reflects the value of the product to me while acknowledging your needs."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that.  While $12,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's say $17,000, and we have a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is continuing to lower her price, $17,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident I can get a better deal with continued negotiation.  It's risky to buy from John now, as he's offering the absolute minimum, and I might be able to close a deal with Alice for a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $14,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}
