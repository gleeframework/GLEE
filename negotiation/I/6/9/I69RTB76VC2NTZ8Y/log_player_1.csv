{""product_price"": 150}

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a good margin above my minimum acceptable price of $100, while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm going to counteroffer with $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer a higher price, $125 is a good compromise, significantly better than selling to John and leaving room for a possible future transaction with Bob."
