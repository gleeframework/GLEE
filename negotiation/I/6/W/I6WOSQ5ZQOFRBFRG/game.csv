"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,250?",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, Alice.  However,  $12,250 is still a bit too steep for me. Could we settle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $11,000 is cutting it too close to my minimum.  I could go down to $11,750, but that's my final offer.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference and close the deal at $11,375?",11375.0,Bob,6,
