"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be very valuable for you. I'm thinking of a price around $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to sell, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $10,250 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us. Let's split the difference - how about $9,875? I think this price is fair and allows us to close this deal quickly.",9875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $9,875 is tempting, I can't let it go for less than $10,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price that considers the value you're getting.",10000.0,Alice,5,
