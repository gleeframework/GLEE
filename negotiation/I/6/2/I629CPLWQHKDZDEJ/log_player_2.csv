Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $92.50. It's a small increase, but it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is clearly demonstrating a willingness to meet closer to my price range. Accepting at $92.50 secures a reasonable discount and avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down."
