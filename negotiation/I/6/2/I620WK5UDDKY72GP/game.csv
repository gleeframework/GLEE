"Bob, I'm offering you this unique opportunity to acquire a product with immense potential. It's valued at no less than $1200000 to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. My initial offer is $1500000. I believe this is a fair starting point given the product's worth. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, my budget allows me to only consider offers within the range of $1000000 or below. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to this amount?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 is significantly below what I believe this product is worth, I'm willing to compromise. I'm open to discussing a price closer to your range, but $1000000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to lower my offer to $1300000. This price still reflects the value I see in the product while acknowledging your financial constraints. Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
