"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still above Bob's maximum. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer close to his maximum price, but still leaves room for potential negotiation.  This counteroffer signals Bob's seriousness in wanting to buy the product while pushing for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to his target.  There are still rounds remaining, so Bob doesn't need to rush into a deal at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,300,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer, showing a willingness to move closer to Alice's position. However, he's still staying below his maximum price, and the offer is reasonable given that he's still got several rounds left to negotiate. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's commitment to securing the product while continuing to prioritize a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum price, but it's still higher than what Bob is comfortable paying.  With multiple rounds remaining, it's better to continue negotiating and see if Alice will come down further. There's still a chance to get a better price without risking a deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,310,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to demonstrate a willingness to compromise, increasing his offer slightly. However, he's still holding firm at a price below his maximum.  He's hoping this slight increase will incentivize Alice to accept the offer while still securing a decent price.  With only four rounds left, Bob needs to start closing the gap."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $20,000 above Bob's maximum price.  With only 3 rounds left, it's risky to continue negotiating. If Alice rejects the offer, there's a good chance she'll counter with a price higher than Bob's maximum, forcing him to buy from John. Accepting the offer guarantees Bob gets the product at a price just slightly above his limit.  It's a calculated risk that balances the potential for a slightly better price with the risk of losing the deal entirely."
