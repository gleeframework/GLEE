"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer.  $1,200,000 is still too high, and there's room for negotiation. Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Moving to the next round allows him to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above Alice's minimum value. This shows a willingness to negotiate while also trying to secure a favorable price.  It's a reasonable starting point for the counter-offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should still reject the offer. While $1,100,000 is lower than the initial offer, it's still higher than the price Bob is aiming for.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows him to continue working towards a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product, but still wants to get a good deal. It's a moderate increase that could be acceptable to Alice, especially if she wants to close the deal."
