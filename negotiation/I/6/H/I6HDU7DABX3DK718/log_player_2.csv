"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique and valuable item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly special, and I think it's a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always worth seeing if you can get a better deal!  Since you have a fallback option with John, rejecting and making a counteroffer is a good strategy."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's still a bit higher than your offer, but still reasonable. How about $11500? I think this is a fair middle ground that could work for both of us. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to make one more concession. I think $11000 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11250?
