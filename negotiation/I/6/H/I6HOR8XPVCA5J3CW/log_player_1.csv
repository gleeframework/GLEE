"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring you get a good return. It also opens the conversation with a friendly tone to encourage a positive negotiation."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort, but I believe I can negotiate a better price. How about $820,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $820,000 is above my minimum, I believe I can get a better deal with Bob. I'll counter his offer and try to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $880,000. It's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 880000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $860,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my ideal price.  While $860,000 is tempting, I think I can push for a slightly higher offer.  We have a few rounds left, so I'm going to counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $870,000.  This offer is a good compromise, and it allows us to both get a good deal. Let's finalize this now."", ""product_price"": 870000}
