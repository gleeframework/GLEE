"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,025,000, which would be $1,062,500. What do you think?",1062500.0,Alice,5,
