"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make a deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
