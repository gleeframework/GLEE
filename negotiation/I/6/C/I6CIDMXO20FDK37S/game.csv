"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product, $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $750,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, so I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $800,000. This is my final concession, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, you're really holding firm, and I respect that.  It seems like we're getting close, but I need you to come down just a bit more.  Would you consider $787,500? This splits the difference and could be a good way to finalize our deal.",787500.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $787,500.
