Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  Bob has a strong incentive to accept, as he values the product at $1,000,000. This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while also being appealing enough to encourage Bob to engage in further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still below what you believe the product is worth. You've already established a higher price point and can leverage your position to potentially secure a better deal.  Rejecting this offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired amount, increasing your potential profit."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
``` 
This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a higher price than his initial counteroffer.  It signals that you're willing to negotiate but also that you believe the product is worth more than $900,000. This strategy keeps the negotiation moving while increasing the likelihood of reaching a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

While $875,000 is higher than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and your own minimum acceptable price. There's still room for negotiation to increase the price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to your desired $950,000."
