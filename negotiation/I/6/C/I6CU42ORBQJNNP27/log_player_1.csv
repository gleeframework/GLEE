"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product.  Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional returns."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This establishes a strong initial position and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique"" qualities and ""exceptional returns"" to justify the high price, even without revealing specifics about its value.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer helps gauge Bob's interest and negotiation style. His response will guide my strategy in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. I have ample room for negotiation and a strong alternative (selling to John).  Rejecting this offer shows I'm serious about a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly substantial. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects the product's unique capabilities and potential for significant returns."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant price drop to signal flexibility and movement towards Bob's offer. However, the new price is still comfortably above both my minimum and Bob's initial offer.
* **Reiterating Value:** The message reinforces the product's high value and potential benefits without revealing specific details that could weaken my negotiating position. 
* **Guaging Seriousness:**  This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's seriousness and willingness to move closer to my desired price range.  A strong negative response might indicate I should consider John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $2,000,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer now matches my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Strong Alternative:** While I could push for a higher price, there's a risk of losing the deal. Accepting ensures I get a good price and avoid potential losses from extended negotiations. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal sooner rather than later has its own value, even if it means accepting a slightly lower price than I might achieve with further negotiation."
