# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a limited time. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer of $120 is less than your maximum price of $150 and also less than buying from John for $150. This saves you money and gets you the product."
