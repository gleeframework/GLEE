"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting high, at $13,000. This is above Bob's value, but it gives us room to negotiate. I'm aiming for a deal close to my minimum value of $12,000.  I'll be ready to counter if Bob rejects this offer, but I'll keep an eye on the clock and consider selling to John if the negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $11,000 is below my minimum value, and I'm not desperate to sell right away. I'm willing to try to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still above Bob's perceived value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering $12,500. This is a compromise: it's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. Hopefully, this will be enticing enough for him to accept, but I'm also ready to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $11,500 is still below my minimum, and I'm not yet willing to settle.  It's getting a bit late in the game, but I still have a few more rounds to work with and I'm hoping to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering my minimum price of $12,000. We're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds, and I'm feeling the pressure to close a deal. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm hopeful that Bob will accept and we can finalize the sale.  If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
