"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $140 is getting too close to John's price of $150. At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice.  You can get the product from John at a slightly higher price, but the negotiation process has become too time-consuming and the price difference is not significant enough to justify continuing."
