Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product and understand your position. While we aim to accommodate all our clients' budgets, we must also ensure the value of our offerings is respected. In light of this, I am proposing a counteroffer of $875,000 for the product. This price reflects a balance between our desire to maintain the product's value and your request for a more favorable price. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations and allows us to move forward towards a mutually beneficial agreement.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  At $875,000, he's getting a significant discount from John's price, and it's likely Alice won't go lower. There's not much more to gain from further negotiation."
