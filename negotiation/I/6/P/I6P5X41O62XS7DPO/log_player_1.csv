I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum value, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'll see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While I could take it and be done, I believe I can do better. I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my desired value. Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair price for the product."
