Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting offer. It's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it's also lower than what I'd be willing to sell it for to John.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while ensuring I still get a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'll counter Bob's offer, aiming to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $16,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. "", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,500. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $14,500 is close to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees my minimum profit and avoids further negotiations."
