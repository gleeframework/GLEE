Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair deal, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle again at $1,093,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,093,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,093,750

{

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is consistently meeting in the middle and the offer of $1,093,750 is a significant profit.  Continuing to push for a higher price could risk Bob walking away.  It's better to secure a very good deal now than to risk getting stuck with John's lower offer later."
