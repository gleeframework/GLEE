"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which is a significant compromise. This price still allows me to achieve a decent return on the product, and it's a much fairer reflection of its value.  What do you say? ",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $825,000 for the product. This is a significant amount of money for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on it. I'm hoping we can reach a deal that benefits both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,
