"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. This is a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is below your maximum budget, but there's room for negotiation. You want to try and get a better price.  By rejecting the offer, you can see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a great starting point. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000 for this product.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is a good compromise and still a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price, and Bob can save $1,000. There's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether."
