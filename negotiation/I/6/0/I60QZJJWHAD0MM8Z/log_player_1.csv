Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  It's below the product's value to Bob, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's a strong starting point:** This price shows you're confident in the product's worth. 

Remember, you can always adjust your price based on Bob's responses and your own assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is still a profit for you, it's a significant drop from your initial offer.  You can likely get closer to your desired price by countering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you'd ideally get closer to $12,000, $10,500 is still a decent profit and very close to the middle ground.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob entirely, especially since John is waiting in the wings."
