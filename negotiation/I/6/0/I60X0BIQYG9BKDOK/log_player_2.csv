"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. My asking price is $120.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Since the product is worth $100 to you, Alice's offer of $120 is too high.  You'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your maximum value of $100. You'll counteroffer again to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
