Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm letting Bob know I'm willing to negotiate, which might encourage him to make a counteroffer.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product by saying it's ""amazing"" and that he'd ""really love it."" This helps create a positive first impression."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price and it avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower offer or no sale at all."
