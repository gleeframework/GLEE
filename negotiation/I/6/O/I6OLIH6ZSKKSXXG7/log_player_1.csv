"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a fairly high starting point, but I believe it gives me room to negotiate down if Bob is interested. I'm also confident in the value of my product, so I'm not afraid to push for a good price.  Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a decent price, it's still below what I consider the product's minimum value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,100,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will show Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I'm not willing to sell for anything less than what I consider fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still above Bob's latest offer and closer to my minimum. I'm hoping that this demonstrates my willingness to compromise, while also putting pressure on Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but I'm feeling a bit pressured.  I'm going to reject his offer and make one final counteroffer in the next round.  If he doesn't accept it, I'll likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to accept $1,000,000, which is my minimum price. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll sell to John."
