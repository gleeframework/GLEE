Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and a potentially quicker sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a sense of urgency (limited-time offer) and positions it as a good deal for Bob, even though it's significantly higher than his perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** There's a possibility Bob might counter-offer, giving me the chance to secure a price even closer to my desired $1,200,000.
 
This strategy aims to balance securing the highest possible profit while increasing the likelihood of closing a deal with Bob before resorting to the guaranteed sale with John."
