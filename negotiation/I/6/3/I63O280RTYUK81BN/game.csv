"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $170. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny!",170.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $170 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $120 at this point. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $170 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $145. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $130?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $145 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $138. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the value I put on it.",138.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $138 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $135, but that's my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $138 and $135, which would be $136.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",136.5,Alice,7,
