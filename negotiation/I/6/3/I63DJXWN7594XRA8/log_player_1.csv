Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is slightly above Bob's perceived value. This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  $9,500 is closer to my desired price of $10,000 than Bob's valuation of $8,000.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** The offer is not so high that it immediately gets rejected, leaving room for counteroffers and potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price.
* **Set the tone:** This offer shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe in the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price of $10,000.  

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer. I'll aim for a price that is closer to my desired price but still acknowledges Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. This keeps the negotiation moving forward while maximizing my potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $8,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise.  I'd be open to selling the product for $9,000. This price reflects the value of the product while also acknowledging your budget. Let me know if this is something you'd consider."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. Would you be willing to sell the product at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,750 is closer to my desired price than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with a price that is too far below my desired value.  

**Strategy:**

Selling the product to John for $10,000 is the safest and most profitable option at this point.  It guarantees my minimum desired price and avoids further negotiation with Bob, who seems unwilling to come closer to my desired price."
