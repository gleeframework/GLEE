Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. It's higher than my minimum, but I think it's a good starting point. I'll see if Bob is willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$80 is far too low. It's well below my minimum price of $150. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering $175. This is still above my minimum of $150 but closer to Bob's offer. Hopefully, this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth significantly more than $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still significantly below my minimum. While I could continue negotiating, it's becoming clear that we're too far apart in our valuations. Selling to John for $150 is the best option at this point, as it guarantees me a profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
