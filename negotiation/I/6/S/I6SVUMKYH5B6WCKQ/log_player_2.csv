"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe is a perfect match for your needs. Considering its value to you, I propose a price of $1,300,000 for this exceptional item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,300,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's valuation of $1,200,000.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have a strong value for your product, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. This price recognizes the quality of the product while allowing me to make a more comfortable investment.  Let's reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:**  This counteroffer offers a midpoint between Alice's previous offer and Bob's last offer. It demonstrates Bob's willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Budget:**  Highlighting ""budget"" reinforces the idea that Bob is serious about the price and isn't just trying to get the lowest possible price.
* **Mutual Benefit:**  The message emphasizes a ""win-win"" scenario, making it more likely Alice will consider the offer.

**Note:**  At this point, Bob is trying to bridge the gap and reach a mutually acceptable price."
