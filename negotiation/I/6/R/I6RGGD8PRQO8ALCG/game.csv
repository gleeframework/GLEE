"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's work together to find a price we both agree on.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit low for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $12,800.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to get a good deal.  What do you say?",12800.0,Alice,5,
