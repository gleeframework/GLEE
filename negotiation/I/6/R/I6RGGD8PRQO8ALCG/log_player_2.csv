```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's work together to find a price we both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit low for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $12,800.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to get a good deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been trying to get the price down to $12,000, and Alice has come down to $12,800.  While this is not Bob's ideal price, it is still a significant saving compared to both John's offer and Alice's initial offer.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to buy the product while still saving money."
