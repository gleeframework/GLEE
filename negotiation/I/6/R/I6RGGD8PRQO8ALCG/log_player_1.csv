"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than the maximum Bob would be willing to pay, leaving some room for negotiation while still securing a good profit for myself.  I'm also highlighting the potential value to Bob in my message, hoping to motivate him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'll counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's work together to find a price we both agree on."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a decent profit margin. I'm also reminding Bob of the product's value to him in an attempt to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $12,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that doesn't meet my minimum value. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit low for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $12,800.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to get a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12800}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's last offer, showing my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profit margin above my minimum.  I'm emphasizing fairness and a win-win situation, hoping to close the deal this round."
