"Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a unique item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. I think this is a great deal, considering its value to you is $100. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to pay $95 for it.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $105.  This is a fair price considering I'm saving you some time and effort by not buying from John.  What do you say?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is a bit more reasonable for you, but I'm not willing to give up on the extra $5. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $107.50. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",107.5,Alice,5,
