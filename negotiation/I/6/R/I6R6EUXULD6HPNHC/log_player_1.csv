"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and allows for potential compromise.  I'm also considering the fact that I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum price, which gives me some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000 and leaves me with a substantial loss. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I have several rounds left, and I can still potentially reach a price that's closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise. However, I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value. I believe that $11,000 is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm hoping to get closer to $11,000. I still have several rounds left and can potentially reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm still aiming for a value that's closer to my desired value. $10,500 is a significant compromise but still allows me to make a decent profit.  I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now in Round 6, and Bob's offer is still significantly below my desired value. While we are getting closer, I've only got 4 rounds left. This isn't enough time for me to feel confident that I can get close to my desired price. Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed profit and ensures I reach my minimum value.  There is no point in risking losing a good deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
