Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to the right buyer, and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering it at $10,000, there's a chance Bob might counter-offer, but still be above your $8,000 minimum. 
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you're not losing anything because you have a guaranteed buyer in John at $8,000."
