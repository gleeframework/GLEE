""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. I'm willing to part with it for $950,000.  This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll recognize it as a sound investment."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and the potential to secure a deal quickly.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still represents a $50,000 discount from John's offer. This creates a sense of urgency and potential gain for Bob.
* **Confident Messaging:**  The tone is assertive but not aggressive, highlighting the product's value and Bob's business sense to make the offer more appealing."
