"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to resist. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering your offer of $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering the product for $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering the product for $1,050,000. This is a slight reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is unlikely to go below $1,000,000 and at this point you're better off taking the sure thing."
