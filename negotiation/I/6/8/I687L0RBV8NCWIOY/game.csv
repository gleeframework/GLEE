"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's a valuable asset, and I believe it has the potential to be a great investment for you. I'm willing to part with it for $1400000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1200000 is simply not enough for me to consider selling.  I'm prepared to come down a bit to $1350000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's work together to find a solution.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1300000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 still isn't quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $1325000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, while also being within your budget.  Let's make this happen!",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to go up to $1290000, but I don't think I can go any higher. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1290000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I truly appreciate your persistence and understanding. I'm willing to come down just a bit more, to $1295000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal!",1295000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down further, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to go up to $1285000, but I don't think I can go any higher. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1285000.0,Bob,8,
