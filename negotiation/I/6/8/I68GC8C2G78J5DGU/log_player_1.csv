""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Creating a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Backup Plan:** We have John as a safety net, guaranteeing us at least $800,000.

By offering the product at $925,000, Alice aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference between her minimum price and Bob's maximum valuation."
