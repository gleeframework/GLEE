"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This is a fair price that I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. How about we meet at $1,250,000? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to negotiate no further if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
