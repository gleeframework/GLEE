Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start high to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters. This allows you to potentially secure a deal above your minimum while still being appealing to Bob.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" subtly reinforces the product's worth, justifying the high price.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still giving Bob a chance to make a deal that works for him."
