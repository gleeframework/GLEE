"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm hoping to get a price closer to $800000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and it gives you a good profit margin.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
