"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $14,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.  Let me know your thoughts.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $15,500. This is a fair price, and I'm sure it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's try to make this work.",15500.0,Bob,4,
