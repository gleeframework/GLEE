"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $14,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}

Round 3

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it is a better price than the first offer, it is still more than Bob is willing to pay. It is worth seeing if they will lower the price further."
