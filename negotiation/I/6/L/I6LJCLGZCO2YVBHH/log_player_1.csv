Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $800,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still too much for me. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $800,000. This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product and my budget.  If you're not willing to come down to this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is firmly rooted at $800,000 and unlikely to budge. It's clear that further negotiation with him won't bridge the gap between his valuation and my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer would mean a significant loss.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is the most logical decision in this scenario to ensure I receive a fair value for the product."
