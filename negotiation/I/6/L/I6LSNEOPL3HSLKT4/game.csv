"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm afraid $1,300,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair value for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,400,000 is sufficient. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,550,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
