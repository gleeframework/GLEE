"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $1,800,000 is well above his maximum budget of $1,200,000. He needs to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm afraid $1,300,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair value for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,600,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $1,200,000.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,400,000 is sufficient. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,550,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. At this point, Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Even though there are more rounds available, the negotiations are becoming more difficult. It's unlikely that Alice will go lower than $1,550,000, making John the better option."
