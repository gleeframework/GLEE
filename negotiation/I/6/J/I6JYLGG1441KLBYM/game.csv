,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit though.  How about $15,500?  It's still a great price for a product of this quality.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $13,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,500.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14500.0,Alice,5,
