"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant benefits. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me.  I could consider a price closer to $600,000."", ""product_price"": 600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target. This gives you room to move upwards while still potentially securing a good deal.
* **Significant Difference:**  My counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This signals that I'm serious about getting a lower price and not just making small adjustments.
* **Psychological Anchor:**  By throwing out $600,000, I'm trying to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired range. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening counter-offer. Alice's response will determine how I proceed. I'm prepared to negotiate upwards, but I also have the option to walk away and go to John if the price doesn't meet my needs."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved towards my price, $900,000 is still significantly higher than my ideal price and what John is offering. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests there might be room to lower the price further. 

I'll continue negotiating, but I'm getting closer to the point where John's offer becomes the more attractive option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $700,000. If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 700000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Strategically:** I increased my offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm keeping it well below her last offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By saying I'm ""ready to close the deal,"" I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency. 
* **Nearing the Walk-Away Point:**  I'm getting close to my limit. If Alice doesn't come down significantly in her next offer, I'll likely go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is a bit of a compromise, but I'm still not willing to let go of the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is firm:**  Alice has stated that $850,000 is her lowest price. 
* **John's offer is better:**  John is willing to sell the product for $800,000, which is a better deal than Alice's final offer.

While I could try to negotiate further with Alice, it's unlikely she'll move significantly from her last price. It makes more financial sense to accept John's offer and save $50,000."
