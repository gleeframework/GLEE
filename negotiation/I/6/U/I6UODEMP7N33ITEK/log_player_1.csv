"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss the sale of this unique product with you.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable figure, so let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  Beginning with a strong offer anchors the negotiation. While Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation while aiming for a higher final price. 
* **Confidence and Openness:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value while signaling a willingness to negotiate.  This encourages Bob to engage seriously.
* **Alternative in Mind:** It's important to remember that John offers a reliable $1,000,000 backup plan.  This knowledge allows for bolder opening moves."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is substantial, there's still a significant gap between his valuation and my minimum. Rejecting this offer allows me to:

* **Gauge Bob's Seriousness:** His response to my counteroffer will reveal how determined he is to acquire the product.
* **Maintain Negotiating Position:** Accepting too quickly could signal desperation and limit potential gains. 

I'm confident that with strategic counteroffers, I can close a deal with Bob above $1,400,000.  The risk of him walking away entirely seems low at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000? This reflects my willingness to make a deal, but also recognizes the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but not by a huge margin. This shows flexibility while still aiming high.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""true value"" reinforces its worth and provides a rationale for my counteroffer.
* **Seeking Common Ground:**  The ""meet in the middle"" phrasing encourages a collaborative approach and suggests a path towards agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,550,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating strong interest. While $1,550,000 is tempting, I believe I can push for more, especially with several rounds remaining. The risk of losing him by countering again seems minimal given his engagement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's find a number we both feel good about. How about $1,600,000? It's a fair reflection of its value and brings us very close to a deal."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** My counteroffer is a smaller decrease than Bob's increase, signaling I'm nearing my bottom line while still encouraging movement on his end.
* **Positive Language:**  Phrases like ""serious,"" ""fair reflection,"" and ""very close"" maintain a constructive and optimistic tone.
* **Time Awareness:**  With rounds passing, I'm applying gentle pressure by emphasizing we're close to an agreement.  This discourages Bob from stalling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,570,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,570,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,570,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob's offer is now very close to my desired range. While I could potentially squeeze out a bit more, the risk of losing the deal increases significantly. 
* **Time Value:** Accepting now secures a substantial profit well above my minimum.  Dragging out the negotiation further has diminishing returns and could backfire.
* **Relationship Building:**  Accepting demonstrates good faith and sets a positive tone for any future dealings with Bob. 

Overall, $1,570,000 is a favorable outcome, and securing it now is the most strategic decision."
