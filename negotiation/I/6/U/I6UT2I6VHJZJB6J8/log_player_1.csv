"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $9,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $22,000 is my initial asking price, I am open to negotiation.  How about we meet halfway at $15,500?  This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll see its value."", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer, but that's still much higher than I can justify. If you're willing to come down to $11,000, I think we could make a deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is less than I'm hoping to get for the product. I could be persuaded to go as low as $13,000.  That's a very fair offer considering the value this product offers."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can see the value in the product, but I have a strict budget. Would you consider $11,500? That's the most I can offer.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate that this is your final offer, but I can't go that high. If you're willing to reconsider and accept $11,750, the deal is yours. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:

It's time to cut bait with Bob. He's clearly unwilling to budge beyond his budget, and while we're getting closer to a potential deal, every further counteroffer risks leaving more money on the table.  We have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John, and it's not worth risking that for a slightly higher potential offer from Bob."
