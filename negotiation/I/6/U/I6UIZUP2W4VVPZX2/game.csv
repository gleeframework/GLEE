"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. This feels like a fair starting point considering what you'll gain from it. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a significant investment for me and closer to my budget. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  To move forward, I could consider $1,050,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise, reflecting the product's worth while acknowledging your investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. However, $1,050,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant investment and a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations remains substantial.  I'm willing to make a final offer of $1,000,000. This is a firm offer, reflecting the absolute lowest price I can consider given the product's worth. I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your final decision.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
