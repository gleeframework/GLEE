"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation and maximize my potential profit.  Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to go higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm still trying to get a price closer to my initial offer, but I'm also being realistic that I might not get my full asking price.  $115 is a good compromise, and hopefully Bob will see that it's a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal to another buyer.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
