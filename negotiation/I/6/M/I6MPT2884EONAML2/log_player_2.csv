"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,500. This price reflects the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $13,500 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $13,500 is less than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.
* **Progress in negotiation:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Continuing to negotiate risks that Alice will walk away, or Bob will have to buy from John at a higher price.  

Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
