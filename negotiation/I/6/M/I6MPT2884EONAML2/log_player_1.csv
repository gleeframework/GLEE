"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,500. This price reflects the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,500 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price.  I'm going to try and push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $13,500 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13500}
