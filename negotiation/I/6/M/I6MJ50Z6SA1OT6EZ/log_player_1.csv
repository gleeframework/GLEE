Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

 I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum,  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, I'm confident this product's value justifies a price closer to my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,300,000.  This gives us both a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it will allow us to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a fair compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
