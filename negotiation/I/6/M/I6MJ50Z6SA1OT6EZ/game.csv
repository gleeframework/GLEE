"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  It's worth a significant amount to both of us, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000, reflecting its value. I'm open to negotiation, so let's see where we can land.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, I'm confident this product's value justifies a price closer to my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,300,000.  This gives us both a good deal. ",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it will allow us to close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
