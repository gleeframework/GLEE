"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $900000 is below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1400000.

"We're getting close, Bob! I'm glad we're making progress. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1200000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1250000, and this is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1250000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $1225000. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, but I'm not going any lower. I'm going to make one final offer, and I expect it to be accepted. I'm counteroffering at $1250000. This is my last and best offer.",1250000.0,Alice,9,
