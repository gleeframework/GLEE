"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, $8500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9500. This would give you a good deal on a product that you've said is worth $8000 to you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9500. However, I'm still only able to go as high as $9000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering I can get the product for $8000 elsewhere. Let's make this deal happen.",9000.0,Bob,4,
