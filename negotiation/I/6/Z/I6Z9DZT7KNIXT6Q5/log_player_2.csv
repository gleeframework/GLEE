"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $10,000 is still too high for him. He can get it for $8,000 from John, so he should try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, $8500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9500. This would give you a good deal on a product that you've said is worth $8000 to you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his ideal price, he can still get the product for less from John.  He should try to negotiate further with Alice to get closer to his target price of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9500. However, I'm still only able to go as high as $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering I can get the product for $8,000 elsewhere. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}
