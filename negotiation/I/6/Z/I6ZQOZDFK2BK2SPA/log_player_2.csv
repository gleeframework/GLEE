"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present you with our flagship product, which I believe will significantly enhance the efficiency and profitability of your operations. Given its value to you, I understand it's worth $12,000 to you. Considering its exceptional quality and the unique benefits it offers, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $14,000. This is an opportunity to secure a high-quality product at a price that is higher than what you perceive its value to be, while still allowing me to recover my investment and maintain a reasonable profit margin. I look forward to your consideration and hope we can make this transaction beneficial for both of us.
