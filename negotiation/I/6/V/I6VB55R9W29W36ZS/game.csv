"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. As we've discussed, the product is worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your life. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree the product is valuable, but $12,000 is a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we settle on $11,800? This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",11800.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $11,800 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $11,200?",11200.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the price down, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,200. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,500 is very close, but I'm afraid my budget is firm. I'd be happy to buy it right now for $11,250.  Otherwise, I'll need to check other options.",11250.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,250. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $11,400. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",11400.0,Alice,7,
