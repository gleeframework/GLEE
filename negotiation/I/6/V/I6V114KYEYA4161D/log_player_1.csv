"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport with Bob.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $140, there's room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for potential negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $120. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush. I can try to get a higher price.
* **Negotiation Space:**  Rejecting his offer gives me the opportunity to counter and potentially reach a compromise closer to my initial asking price.
* **Testing the Waters:** I want to see if Bob is willing to increase his offer or if he's firm at $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer but still above Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that even at $130, he's getting a good deal for a product he values at $150.
* **Finding Common Ground:** I'm emphasizing the need for both of us to find a price that works for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. I would like to propose a price of $125, which is closer to my budget while still reflecting the value of the product. I hope this suggestion is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $125 is only $5 away from my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Time is Money:** We've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Even though it's not my ideal price, accepting this offer might lead to future opportunities with Bob."
