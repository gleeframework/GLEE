Alice's offer is far too high. You should reject it and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

Alice's offer is still too high. You should continue negotiating and see if you can get a better price.  It is likely you can get a price closer to your budget."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $10,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to consider $14,000 as my final offer. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to reach a deal.

Alice's offer is still too high, and it is unlikely she will go lower.  It's time to take the sure thing and buy from John."
