"Hi Alice,  $20,000 is way above my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $17,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I understand the product's value, but I'm really pushing the limit at $10,000.  If we can find common ground at this price, I'm ready to make a deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $10,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to consider $14,000 as my final offer. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to reach a deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,
