Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice will accept no less than $1,500,000 for the product.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **John's Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $1,500,000 if Bob refuses.

**Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim to sell the product for the highest price Bob is willing to pay, knowing that she has a backup offer.  Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, Alice should start negotiations slightly above that amount.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Positive:** The message is clear and highlights the product's value.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price is set above Bob's valuation but below Alice's minimum and John's offer. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Confidence:** By expressing confidence in the offer's fairness, Alice sets a strong negotiating position.

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might outright reject the offer. However, this strategy maximizes Alice's potential profit while keeping the John backup option available."
