"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $11,500 is less than Bob's maximum of $15,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** Bob already made a counteroffer and it was rejected. Further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Time is a factor:**  As the rounds progress, the risk of losing the deal to another buyer increases.  
* **Value for Bob:**  The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, so even at $11,500, he's still getting a good deal.

Accepting Alice's offer at this point balances the desire for a lower price with the need to secure the product before other opportunities disappear."
