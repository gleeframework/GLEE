"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $125 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in that price.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $130? It's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
