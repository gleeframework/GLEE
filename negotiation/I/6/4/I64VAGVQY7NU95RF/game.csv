"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. How about $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit high for me. How about $108?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your price, but $108 is still a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $109?  I'm confident this will be a good deal for both of us.",109.0,Alice,5,
