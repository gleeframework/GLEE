Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 1400000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired price, leaving room for negotiation. This also anchors Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher point. 
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly break down the product's value, it alludes to it by mentioning ""value and potential."" This aims to justify the high initial price.
* **Alternative:**  It's important to remember you have John as a backup buyer. This gives you leverage in negotiations, allowing you to be firmer with your pricing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is higher than his perceived value ($1,000,000) but still significantly below your minimum ($1,200,000). There's room for negotiation. You have the security of John's offer, allowing you to push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. This product offers unique advantages, and its value goes beyond typical market comparisons. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This message acknowledges Bob's offer but firmly reiterates that your price is non-negotiable below a certain point. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique advantages"" reinforces the value proposition, justifying the higher price.
* **Compromise:**  Meeting in the middle signals a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price above your minimum. This leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has unique advantages, but I still think $1,250,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,200,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches John's offer, meeting your minimum acceptable price. There's no strategic advantage to continuing the negotiation with Bob, as you have a guaranteed buyer at that price with John. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation breaking down."
