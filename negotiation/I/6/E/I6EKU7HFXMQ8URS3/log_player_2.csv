Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,225,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

Alice is clearly holding firm on her price, and while another counteroffer might shave off a little more, it's unlikely to be a significant amount. Accepting the $1,225,000 offer secures a good deal for Bob, saving him $275,000 off John's price."
