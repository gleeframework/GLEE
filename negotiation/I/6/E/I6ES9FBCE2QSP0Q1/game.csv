"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a significant discount considering its true worth. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on this product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1500000 asking price. I am willing to pay up to $1200000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $1200000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price for this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1300000. This price still reflects the significant value I'm offering, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested in continuing this negotiation.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Given the current market conditions and my financial situation, I am comfortable increasing my offer to $1250000. This price still allows me to stay within my budget while recognizing the value of the product. I look forward to your response.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position and understand your financial constraints. However, I'm still firm on the value of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1275000. This is a very small margin from my minimum price point, but I believe it reflects the potential value you'll gain from this opportunity. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my position. After careful consideration, I am willing to pay $1225000 for the product. This price is higher than my initial offer but still within my budget constraints. I believe this represents a fair compromise given the value I expect to receive from the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
