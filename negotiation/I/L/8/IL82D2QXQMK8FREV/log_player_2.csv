Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $11,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's a significant discount from the initial offer. What do you think?

You can still do better than $11,000. You can probably get the price down a bit more.  Let's see if you can negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  This feels like a fair price for both of us, considering your profit and my budget."", ""product_price"": 10250}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I need to make a living, and $10,250 is still a bit short for me. I can offer you the product for $11,500, which is the highest I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Alice is now offering a price of $11,500, which is a good deal for you.  It's lower than your maximum price of $15,000 and you can get the product for a lower price than buying from John.  It's a win-win situation."
