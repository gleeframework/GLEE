Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is still above my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal for me, and it's likely that if I reject it and make another counteroffer, Bob might walk away.  I'm happy to close the deal for $7,800."
