Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit above my minimum ($12,000).
* **Secure the Sale:** Offering a price significantly lower than Bob's perceived value increases the likelihood he'll accept without trying to haggle me down too much. 

This strategy aims to balance profit maximization with a high probability of securing the sale with Bob."
