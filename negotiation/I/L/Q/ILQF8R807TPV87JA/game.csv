"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price of $10500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I can't quite meet you at $10500. I can offer you a price of $11200, which is a bit more than my initial offer, but still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your previous offer and my initial counteroffer. Can you consider a price of $10800?",10800.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I can appreciate that. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $10800. I can offer you a price of $11500, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to find a balance, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go down to $11000. Can you consider that?",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $11800, which is getting closer to your budget. However, I need to emphasize that this is my final offer within this range. What do you think?",11800.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11400.
