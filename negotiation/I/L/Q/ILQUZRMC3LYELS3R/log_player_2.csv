"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price just for you, Bob. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000, which is a great deal considering its true value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is a terrible deal!  You would be paying $4,000 more than it's worth to you and $4,000 more than John's offer. Always go for the best deal."
