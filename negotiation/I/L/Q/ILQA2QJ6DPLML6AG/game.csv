"Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a fortune, and I believe it will be a game-changer for your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000, a significant discount considering its true value.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and our desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for your business.  Consider the potential impact it could have on your bottom line. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a great deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's find common ground and make this deal happen.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay right now.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a significant investment on my part.  Let's try to bridge this gap and finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still quite a bit below the true value of this product.  It has the potential to generate significant revenue for your business.  To demonstrate my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit.  Let's close this deal, and you'll see the impact this product can have for your company.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $1,175,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,160,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to close this deal.",1160000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting close.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,160,000 still doesn't reflect the true value this product brings.  To show my commitment, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,165,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth while allowing us to close this deal.  What do you say?",1165000.0,Alice,7,
