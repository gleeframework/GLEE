{""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a fortune, and I believe it will be a game-changer for your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000, a significant discount considering its true value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and our desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below the product's value to him. By rejecting, I can try to push for a higher price in the next round, aiming for a more equitable deal.  Selling to John right now would mean leaving a lot of money on the table, considering Bob is willing to pay more."

Round 3

Consider the potential impact it could have on your bottom line. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a great deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's find common ground and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay right now.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a significant investment on my part.  Let's try to bridge this gap and finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.
