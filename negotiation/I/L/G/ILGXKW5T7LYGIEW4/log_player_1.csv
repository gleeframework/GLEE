{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it! I'm offering it to you for $150.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point.  It's above your minimum, but not so high that it immediately scares Bob away.  We'll see how he responds and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is more than our minimum, we can try to push for a higher price. We'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! $120 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135. That's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $135 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer to our desired price, and we're running the risk of losing him entirely. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit greater than selling to John."
