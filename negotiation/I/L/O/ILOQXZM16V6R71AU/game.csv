"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can offer it to you for $12,750. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better offer elsewhere.",12750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $11,500.  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not willing to sell at $11,500. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",13000.0,Alice,7,
