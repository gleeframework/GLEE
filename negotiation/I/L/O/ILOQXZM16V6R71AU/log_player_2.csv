Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not willing to sell at $11,500. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems unwilling to budge from her price range around $13,000. It's clear she's aiming for a price above her product's value to her ($12,000).  Continuing negotiations is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome.  It's more strategic at this point to cut my losses and buy from John for $15,000. While not ideal, it's better than getting stuck in a stalemate with Alice and potentially missing out on the product entirely."
