Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests, and I'm confident you'd find it beneficial. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000 for this exclusive offer."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, you aim for a price within that range to maximize profit.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a substantial profit above Bob's valuation.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob, potentially increasing his perceived worth and justifying the price. 

This strategy balances securing the sale with maximizing your potential earnings."
