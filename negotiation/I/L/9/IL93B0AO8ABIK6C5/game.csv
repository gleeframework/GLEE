"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique qualities and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to me.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $500,000 is significantly below its true value.  This product offers substantial benefits that justify a higher price. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we need to find some middle ground here. Your offer is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000. I'm hoping you can see that I'm serious about purchasing this product.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. To demonstrate my commitment, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me but your counteroffers aren't reflecting the urgency to close this deal. I'm raising my offer to $750,000, but this is my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll need to explore other options.",750000.0,Bob,6,
