"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,600,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is still a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is too low for me to consider.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's close this deal!",1250000.0,Bob,4,
