Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than the product is worth to you, giving you room to negotiate. 
* **It's not too high:** It's within the realm of reason for Bob, who values the product at $80.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust your price based on Bob's response. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $75 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $75 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? "", ""product_price"": 82.50}
```

This counteroffer does the following:

* **It's a compromise:** It's in the middle of your original price and Bob's offer.
* **It's still above your minimum:** You're still earning more than the product is worth to you.
* **It demonstrates flexibility:** You're willing to negotiate to reach a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $82.50 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $78 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $78 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'll make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're trying to work with me here.  $78 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet at $80? That's a fair price for both of us, and I can let the deal go through right now."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

This counteroffer is my final attempt to close the deal with Bob:

* **It's a fair price:** It's my minimum acceptable price, and it's also the price John is willing to pay.
* **It's a clear signal:** It shows Bob that I'm serious about selling at this price, and I'm not willing to go lower.
* **It's a final offer:** If Bob rejects this offer, I will sell to John."
