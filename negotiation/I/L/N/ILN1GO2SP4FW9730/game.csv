"Thanks for your counteroffer Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $75 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? ",82.5,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $82.50 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $78 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to work with me here.  $78 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet at $80? That's a fair price for both of us, and I can let the deal go through right now.",80.0,Alice,5,
