"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's something I've valued at no less than $1,000,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us. Would you be interested in discussing a potential sale at $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than the product's worth to her.  This means there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting, Bob can potentially get a better deal from Alice or at least force her to come down further in price.  Buying from John is the worst option as it's the highest price."
