Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $1,200,000. It's a significant value for you, and I believe this price is fair considering its worth to both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $900,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a higher price from Bob. I'm going to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. This price still reflects a significant value for you, and leaves room for us to both walk away happy.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This price reflects the value to me and is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach a deal in this round. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$950,000 is closer to my desired price, but I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can close the deal in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in trying to find a good price. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000, which is a good compromise considering the value this product offers you.  Let's seal the deal in this round!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $975,000. This is a fair price considering our previous negotiations and leaves some room for both of us to walk away happy. Let's settle this in this round. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $975,000 is getting closer to my desired price.  While I'd love to push for more, we're nearing the end of the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  This is a good price, and I'm going to accept it."
