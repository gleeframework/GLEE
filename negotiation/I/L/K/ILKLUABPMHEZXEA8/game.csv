"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. This price still reflects a significant value for you, and leaves room for us to both walk away happy.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
