"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm asking for $20000 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $10000 is lower than I hoped, I'm willing to come down to $17000. This reflects the unique value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it is still above Bob's budget.  Bob is willing to pay $10,000, so rejecting and counter-offering again is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $17,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to go that high.  I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a solution."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're firm on your budget.  While I'm still confident this product is worth more than $10000, I'm willing to go down to $15000 to finalize this deal.  This is the lowest I can go, and I'd hate to miss out on the opportunity to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's price point, but $15,000 is still above his budget.  Bob is willing to pay $10,000, so he should continue negotiating.  There are still a few rounds left to reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but unfortunately, $15,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I can only offer $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
