Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Offering the product at $19,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.  
* **Negotiation Room:**  This price leaves room for negotiation if Bob shows interest but finds the initial price too high. You can always lower the price closer to $15,000 during the negotiation.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response and be ready to walk away if he's not willing to meet a price that's beneficial for you."
