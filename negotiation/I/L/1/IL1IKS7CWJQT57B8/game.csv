,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? I'm willing to pay a fair price for a great product like this.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, would you consider $102.50? I'm really interested in the product and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",102.5,Bob,4,
