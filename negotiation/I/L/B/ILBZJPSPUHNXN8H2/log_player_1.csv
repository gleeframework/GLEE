Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your proposal, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,100,000. Would you consider reducing the price to $950,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a psychologically pleasing number, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum acceptable price. It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
