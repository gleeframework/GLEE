"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1400000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1400000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1600000. This is a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1600000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1500000 for it, which is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. I can offer it to you for $1700000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value this product brings.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
