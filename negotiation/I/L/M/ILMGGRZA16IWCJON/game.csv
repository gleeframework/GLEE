"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $22,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",12000.0,Bob,4,
