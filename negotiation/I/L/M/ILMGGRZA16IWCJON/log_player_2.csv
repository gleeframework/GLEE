"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $22,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  It's too early to give in, so I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $22,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I believe this price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, $18,000 is still too high. I'll reject and try to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon."", ""product_price"": 12000}
