"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a fair price.  What do you think about $125? Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Buying from Alice for $125 saves you $25 compared to buying from John. 
* **Alice's offer is within your budget:**  $125 is within your maximum budget of $150. 

It makes sense to accept Alice's offer to get the product at a lower price."
