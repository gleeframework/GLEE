"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, my budget for this acquisition is around $1200000.  I'd be happy to explore this further if you're willing to consider a price closer to that figure.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1300000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1300000 is still a bit outside of my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to offer $1250000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
