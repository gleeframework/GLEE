Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of what the product can achieve."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes ""value"" and ""potential"" to justify the higher price, framing it as an investment rather than a purchase.
* **Exclusivity:** By presenting it as an ""exclusive opportunity,"" it creates a sense of scarcity and urgency for Bob to act. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While you know the product's worth to Bob, he might need further convincing to accept a price significantly higher than your minimum.
* **Negotiation:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You can then negotiate down from your initial price, knowing your bottom line is $1,200,000."
