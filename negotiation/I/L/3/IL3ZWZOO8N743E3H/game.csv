"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective, however,  the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer. I could come down to $1,950,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  What do you say?",1950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,950,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
