"Hello Alice, thanks for offering! $150 seems a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I can do better than $60, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, Alice. However, $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  How about $75? ",75.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $90, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great product, and I think it's worth more than that.",90.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, I do like the product, but I have a budget!  $90 is close, but I can only do $80.  Take it or leave it!",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already told you, Bob, I won't go below $90. I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product. If you're willing to meet me at $90, I'll consider it. Otherwise, I'll have to look elsewhere.",90.0,Alice,7,
