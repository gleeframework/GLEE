Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate, but still allows me to potentially make a profit.  I'll be prepared to negotiate, but I'm also ready to walk away and sell to John if Bob is unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is a better price than John's offer, I still think I can get closer to my ideal price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get him to come up a little higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,750.  This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still leaves a bit of room for negotiation. I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair price and agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can push for a higher price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500. This is a final offer that's a compromise between my desired price and Bob's current offer. I'm hoping he'll see that this is a fair price and agree. If he doesn't, I'm ready to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not confident that we'll reach a deal. It's better to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John than risk further negotiation with Bob."
