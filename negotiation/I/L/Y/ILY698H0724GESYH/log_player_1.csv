Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $80 (your guaranteed price from John).
* **Maximize Profit:**  Offering it for slightly less than Bob's maximum value ($119) gives him a small incentive to buy while maximizing your profit.

This strategy aims to leave Bob with a small gain ($1) while you secure almost the full potential profit ($39)."
