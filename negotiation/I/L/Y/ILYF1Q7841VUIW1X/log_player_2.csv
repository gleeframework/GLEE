"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is a good price, Bob can likely get it for less.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway, offering a price that is still above her minimum but significantly lower than her initial offer. This shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is only $10 more than Bob's counteroffer and a significant drop from her initial offer.  This is a good deal for Bob, as he can purchase the product for less than the $120 he would pay John.  There's a chance he could get it for even less, but the risk of Alice rejecting his next counteroffer and the time pressure (only 7 rounds left) make accepting the offer the best choice."
