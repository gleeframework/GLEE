"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is valuable to me, but $11,500 is a bit steep.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in your product. Let's work together to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need a price closer to my asking price to make this work. How about $11,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be happy. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob wants to save as much as possible and can likely get a better price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - $10,750.  This price is fair to both of us and will allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $10,750 simply isn't enough for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,900. This price is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price:** $10,900 is a good price for Bob. It's lower than John's offer of $12,000 and within Bob's budget.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and further negotiation might not yield a much lower price.
* **Time:** It's round 5, and Bob might want to close the deal before running out of rounds. 

Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a decent price and avoids the risk of losing the deal to John or running out of negotiation rounds."
