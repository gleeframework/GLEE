"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand that $1,500,000 is a bit steep for you. However, $800,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,200,000 is closer, but still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference again and do $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to compromise again. I'll meet you at $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
