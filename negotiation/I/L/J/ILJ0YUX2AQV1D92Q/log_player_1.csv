Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
 **Reasoning:** 
 
 * **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($150) to maximize profit. 
 * **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 allows some room for Bob to negotiate down, while still keeping us well above our minimum acceptable price ($80).
 * **First Offer Importance:** Since Bob can outright reject the first offer, we want it to be enticing enough to consider. 
 
 This strategy aims for a win-win scenario where Bob gets a product he values for a perceived fair price, and you earn a significant profit."
