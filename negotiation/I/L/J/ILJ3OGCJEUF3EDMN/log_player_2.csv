"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's starting price is too high.  There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."

{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Could you do $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Respectful but Firm:** The message is polite but clearly states that the initial offer is not acceptable. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer gauges Alice's flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While Alice has come down, we're still $1,000 away from her value ($10,000) and there's a $2,000 buffer before John's offer becomes a factor. 
* **Strategic Concession:** By rejecting this offer, we signal to Alice that we're serious about getting a better price but are willing to continue negotiating."

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  To be honest, $10,750 is about as high as I can go. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 10750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slowing Down Concessions:** We are reducing the size of our counter-offers, signaling that we are getting closer to our limit.
* **Targeting Above Her Value:** Our goal is to land a price somewhere above Alice's $10,000 valuation, but well below John's offer. 
* **Direct and Clear:**  This offer is straightforward and avoids ambiguity, aiming for a quick and agreeable resolution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob. But I still need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet at $11,200? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Testing the Waters:** Alice is signaling that she's close to accepting. We need to see if she's willing to come down further or if we're reaching a stalemate. 
* **John's Offer is Approaching:**  While $11,200 isn't terrible, the difference is small enough now that we need to consider if the potential savings from Alice are worth the risk of her walking away and us having to pay John's $12,000 price."

{
""message"": ""This is a fair offer, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be completely transparent, $10,800 is the absolute highest I can go. If that works, we have a deal!"",
""product_price"": 10800
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This message conveys a sense of finality.  We're making it clear this is our best price.
* **Slightly Above Midpoint:** This offer splits the difference between her last offer ($11,200) and our last offer ($10,750), demonstrating compromise while still trying to secure a favorable price.
* **Time for Decision:**  We're pushing for a decision from Alice. If she rejects this, it may be time to move on to John to avoid potentially missing out entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm really close to accepting your offer, Bob. But I still need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to meet you at $11,100. It's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,100.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, meaning further negotiation is unlikely.
* **Minimal Savings from John:** Accepting this offer saves $900 compared to John's price. Further haggling carries the risk of Alice walking away, forcing us to buy from John and lose any potential savings.
* **Time Value:** Reaching a deal now avoids potentially lengthy back-and-forth and ensures we secure the product.

While we might be able to squeeze out a few hundred dollars more, the risk of losing the deal and paying a higher price with John outweighs the potential benefit."
