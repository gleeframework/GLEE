"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200, which is a very fair price considering its value. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I agree it's a great item, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $60 is significantly below the product's value. I could consider letting it go for $160.  This is my final offer.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $160 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $110? It's a fair offer considering the current market value.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, I can't accept anything less than $130 for this product. It's a final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to make this work, and I'm willing to stretch my budget a little. How about $115? That's the absolute highest I can go.",115.0,Bob,6,
