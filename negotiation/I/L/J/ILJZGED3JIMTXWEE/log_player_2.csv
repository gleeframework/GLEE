"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200, which is a very fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I agree it's a great item, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it."",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

This counter-offer starts significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but leaves room for negotiation. By anchoring our offer low, we increase the chances of getting a better deal, even if we don't reach our ideal price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $60 is significantly below the product's value. I could consider letting it go for $160.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice lowering her price but stating ""final offer"" is likely a negotiation tactic. We're still far from our budget, so we'll push back and see if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $160 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $110? It's a fair offer considering the current market value."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

We're increasing our offer to show willingness to negotiate but staying firm below our $120 limit. Mentioning ""market value"" subtly challenges Alice's perception of the product's worth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, I can't accept anything less than $130 for this product. It's a final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is slowly coming down, but $130 is still too high. We'll reject and counter-offer one last time, pushing closer to our limit to signal our interest while being prepared to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to make this work, and I'm willing to stretch my budget a little. How about $115? That's the absolute highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

We're making a smaller counter-offer this time, close to our limit. By saying it's our ""absolute highest,"" we're signaling firmness and the possibility of walking away if Alice doesn't budge."
