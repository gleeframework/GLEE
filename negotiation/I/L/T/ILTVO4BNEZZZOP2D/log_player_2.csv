"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'll reject the offer. The product is worth $800,000 to me, and Alice is asking for $1,200,000, which is $400,000 more than I'm willing to pay. I'll look for a better deal.
