"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle - how about $2,100,000?",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above my budget with that offer. I'd be willing to go up to $1,600,000, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is simply too low for a product of this caliber. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,950,000. This is my bottom line, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Take some time to consider it.",1950000.0,Alice,5,
