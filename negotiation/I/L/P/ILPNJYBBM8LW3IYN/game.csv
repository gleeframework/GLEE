"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go for $110? That's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $110, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $108? That's the best I can do.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $108 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, but that's my final offer. If you're not interested, I can always sell to John for $120.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm willing to go up to $110, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $109? That's the best I can do.",109.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. However, $109 is still a little too low. Let's split the difference again and go for $110. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the value.",110.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to walking away, but I'll make one more offer. How about $107? That's the absolute lowest I'm willing to go.",107.0,Bob,8,
