Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value, making the higher price seem more reasonable.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $8,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you don't lose out.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know Bob values the product at $8,000, he doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer. This lack of information could work in your favor.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a strategy for negotiating down to a price you find acceptable is important."
