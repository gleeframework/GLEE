Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,500,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price, you're in a strong position.  You should aim for a price that's beneficial for you while still being enticing enough for Bob to accept.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,450,000. I'm confident this is a competitive price considering its benefits and the high demand I'm seeing from other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You highlight the exclusivity and value of the product.
* **High but Reasonable Price:**  $1,450,000 is significantly above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation if he's very interested. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning ""other interested parties,"" you create a sense of competition and encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, a more moderate initial offer might be preferable. 

**Remember:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You always have the option to accept his counter, make another offer, or walk away knowing you have John as a backup buyer."
