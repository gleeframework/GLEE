``` 

This product is worth $10,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $11,000. That's a clear indication she's willing to negotiate. There's no reason to accept that offer when we can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is getting closer to my price point. However, $9,500 is still higher than my limit. I can likely get a better price with a counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While I'd prefer to pay less, $9,400 is within my budget, and with only 5 rounds remaining, it's risky to keep negotiating. There's a chance Alice won't come down further, and I might have to settle for buying from John at a higher price."
