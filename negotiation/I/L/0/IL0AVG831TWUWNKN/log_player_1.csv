"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good starting point. I know Bob values it at $8,000, so this leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum.  I want to see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. I want to see if I can push for a higher price before potentially selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher price than Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise. This gives me a chance to get closer to my desired price without risking losing the deal completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $9,250 is closer to my minimum, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9400}
```

I'm going to compromise a little more, but still trying to push for a higher price.  I believe Bob is getting closer to my price point, and I think I can squeeze out a little more."
