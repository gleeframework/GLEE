(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  $75 is a good starting point, but you might be able to get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $60. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Alice is willing to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$65 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to negotiate a little more. I'll try to get it down to $60 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 62}
```

I'm going to offer $62.  This is a small step closer to my ideal price, and I think Alice might be willing to accept it at this point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $63. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $63
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $63, which is a good price considering my initial target of $60.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid potentially losing out on a good deal by continuing to negotiate."
