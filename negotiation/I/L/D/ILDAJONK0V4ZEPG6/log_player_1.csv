"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's value to see if he's willing to negotiate.  I'm confident I can get at least $8,000 from John, so I have some room to play with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $500 less than my initial asking price, and it's above my minimum.  I'd rather secure the sale now than risk further negotiation and potentially end up selling to John for less."
