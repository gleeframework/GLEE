"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $800000. Let me know if this is more in line with what you're thinking.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still not convinced the product is worth $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1000000. Can you consider this offer?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $1150000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already decided to buy the product from John for $1000000, so I'll have to decline your offer. Thank you for the negotiation, and I wish you the best with the product.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
