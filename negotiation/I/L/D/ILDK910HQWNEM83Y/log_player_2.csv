# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to make this deal happen.

I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $12,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly coming down on price, it's unlikely she'll reach a price significantly better than John's $10,000 offer. Further haggling might save a small amount, but the risk of Alice walking away and the time spent negotiating make John's offer the safer and more efficient choice."
