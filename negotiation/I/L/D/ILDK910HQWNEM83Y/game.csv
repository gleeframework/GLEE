"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to make this deal happen.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $12,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming closer to my price range. However, $12,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Could you do $9,500?  I think that's a fair price that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $11,000. This is still a good deal for me, considering the product's worth to me is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,5,
