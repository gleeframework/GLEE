,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is a little lower than I was hoping for. This product is truly unique and offers a lot of value. How about we meet in the middle at $19000? I'm confident you'll be happy with this price and I'm willing to negotiate further to make this work.",19000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $19000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $17500. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",17500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a little hesitant to go down to $17500.  This product is truly unique and holds a lot of value. How about we split the difference and go with $18250?  I'm confident this price reflects both the value of the product and your budget. Let's close this deal and make it happen!",18250.0,Alice,5,
