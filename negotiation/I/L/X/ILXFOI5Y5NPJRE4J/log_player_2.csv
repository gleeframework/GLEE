"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it is still above Bob's budget.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer gives Bob the chance to potentially reach a price he is comfortable with."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and he has a strict budget of $8,000.  While Alice has come down to $10,000, this is still above Bob's budget.  Since he can buy the product from John for $8,000, it is more advantageous for Bob to take John's offer and save $2,000 compared to accepting Alice's offer."
