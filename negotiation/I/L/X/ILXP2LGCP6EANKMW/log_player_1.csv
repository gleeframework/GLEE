"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable price ($100).  This allows for some wiggle room during negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being positive and highlighting the value of the product to Bob. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Set a high initial price:** This gives me a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Show confidence:** A confident approach can make Bob more likely to take the deal seriously. 
* **Focus on value:**  By mentioning the product's value, I'm subtly reminding Bob of the potential benefit he'll get from buying it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get a price closer to my desired value.  There are still 8 rounds remaining, giving me time to explore other options with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is still too low for me.  How about $95? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and it gives you a good deal. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a counteroffer at $95, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows willingness to compromise while maintaining a reasonable profit.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and emphasizing the fair price and the good deal Bob will get.  I'm also using a positive and encouraging tone to encourage Bob to accept. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell and that I expect a better price.
* **Signal flexibility:** While not accepting Bob's offer, I'm showing a willingness to compromise and move closer to his price. 
* **Reinforce value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob, making it clear that my price is justified."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let's split the difference and make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still see room for improvement. I'm confident I can get a better deal with a few more rounds of negotiation.  I'm willing to take the risk and see if Bob is willing to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up.  $90 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  How about $92?  It's a small difference, and it shows that we're both making compromises.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price of $92, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a continued willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a price closer to my desired value.
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and persuasive tone, acknowledging Bob's compromise and emphasizing the small difference between our offers.  I'm framing this as a way for us to both find a mutually agreeable solution.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain pressure:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing a willingness to negotiate, putting pressure on him to increase his offer again.
* **Signal flexibility:**  By making a small counteroffer, I'm demonstrating that I'm flexible and willing to work toward a deal.
* **Highlight compromise:**  I'm emphasizing the mutual compromise needed to reach an agreement."
