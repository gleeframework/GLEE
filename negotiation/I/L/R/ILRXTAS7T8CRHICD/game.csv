"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,250? It's a fair price that would make us both happy. Let's try to work this out!",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,100 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,150. This is a very fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon. What do you say?",11150.0,Alice,5,
