"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but significantly below my minimum ($12,000).  This leaves room for negotiation without immediately making him feel like I'm trying to rip him off.
* **Friendly Tone:** Using a friendly tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation and builds a rapport.
* **Focus on Value:** Highlighting that it's a ""great deal for both of us"" subtly emphasizes the potential for him to get a good price while ensuring I get a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. However, I would like to make you an offer of $11,000 if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $11,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my $12,000 minimum.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  Since Bob is willing to negotiate, there's still potential to close a deal closer to my desired price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John guarantees $12,000, there's still a chance to get a slightly better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob.  The risk of Bob walking away is balanced by the potential reward of a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,250? It's a fair price that would make us both happy. Let's try to work this out!"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to work towards a deal.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language like ""split the difference"" and ""make us both happy"" to create a sense of mutual benefit and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Continued Negotiation:**  While closer to my minimum, $11,250 still allows for potential for further negotiation if Bob is still hesitant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose an offer of $11,100 for the product. This is my best offer within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,100 is still below my minimum of $12,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Even though Bob claims it's his ""best offer,"" there's still a chance to squeeze out a few more dollars by continuing to negotiate. 
* **Weighing risk vs. reward:**  While selling to John guarantees $12,000, I'm still motivated to get the best possible price. The risk of Bob walking away is less significant than the potential for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,100 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,150. This is a very fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession by dropping my price from $11,250 to $11,150. This shows flexibility without compromising my bottom line too much.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as ""very fair"" to encourage Bob to see the value in accepting.
* **Time Constraint:**  I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency by mentioning ""reaching an agreement soon."" This can nudge Bob towards accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer of $11,150. I've carefully considered my budget and I believe I can meet you halfway at $11,125. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $11,125 is very close to my minimum of $12,000.  It's only $87.50 less than my desired price.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  There's a high risk that if I reject Bob's offer, he'll walk away, and I might end up selling to John for less than I could get from Bob.
* **Time Constraint:**  We're already at Round 6, leaving only 4 rounds left to reach a deal.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a decent price while minimizing the risk of losing the deal altogether."
