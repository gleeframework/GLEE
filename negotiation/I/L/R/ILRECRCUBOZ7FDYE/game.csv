"I'm very interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a deal for $17000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to offer $14500. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made a serious offer, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14500. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, which is a compromise from my previous offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and your previous offers.",16000.0,Alice,5,
