"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.
* It's worth exploring further negotiation with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $10,500? This is a fair compromise and a good value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget. 
* Bob can still try to negotiate further and see if he can get a better price. 
* There are still several rounds left, and Bob has time to try to reach a deal that is more favorable to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to go up to $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price that's closer to my budget.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to drop my price a bit further, but $9,500 is still a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $10,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price.
* Bob is determined to get the best deal possible, and he's only a few rounds away from potentially buying from John for $8,000.
* He still has time to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, so it's worth continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,750. This is a good deal for both of us, and it gets us closer to a final agreement.  Let's finalize this now."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,750 is still a bit lower than I'd like.  Let's compromise one last time. I'm willing to offer you the product for $10,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to be satisfied.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's ideal price.
* With only three rounds left, Bob is running out of time to negotiate a lower price with Alice.
* Buying from John for $8,000 is the most financially advantageous option at this point, as it guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget.
* While there's a chance of negotiating further with Alice, the risk of not reaching an agreement and ending up with no product is too high."
