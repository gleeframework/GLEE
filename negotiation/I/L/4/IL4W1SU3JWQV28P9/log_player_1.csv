"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than nothing, I can likely get closer to my desired price range. I'll counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $10,500? This is a fair compromise and a good value for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to go up to $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price that's closer to my budget.  Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my goal, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  I'll see if I can push for a slightly higher counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to drop my price a bit further, but $9,500 is still a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,750. This is a good deal for both of us, and it gets us closer to a final agreement.  Let's finalize this now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,750 is getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal with a counteroffer.  The negotiation is getting down to the wire, but I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,750 is still a bit lower than I'd like.  Let's compromise one last time. I'm willing to offer you the product for $10,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to be satisfied.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
