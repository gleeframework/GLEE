Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, it's always best to try for a higher profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 allows some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's interested, bringing the price closer to your minimum. 
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:**  Offering it at a price too close to $15,000 might discourage Bob immediately. This offer leaves the door open for a deal while still aiming high."
