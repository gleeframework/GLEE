# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $150 by you. I am proposing to sell it to you for $135, which I believe is a fair price considering its quality and value. This offer is exclusive to you and won't be available to anyone else. Please let me know if you're interested in securing this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Buying from Alice for $135 is cheaper than buying from John for $150.
* **You're willing to pay up to $150:** Even though the product is only worth $100 to Alice, it's worth $150 to you, so you're willing to pay up to that amount. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option for you, as it allows you to buy the product at a lower price than what you're willing to pay."
