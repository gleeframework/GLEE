"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase, but I need to stay within my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. I believe the product's value is worth a premium, and I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for it.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1400000. This is my final offer, and I'd appreciate it if you could consider it.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1700000. I believe the product's value is worth a significant premium, and I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get closer to my target price.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $1600000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. This is my last offer, and I'd appreciate it if you could consider it.",1600000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering $1650000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal happen.",1650000.0,Alice,7,

I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal happen.",1680000.0,Alice,9,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best price possible, but I'm not willing to go above $1550000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. I'm open to other options, including buying from John for $1000000.",1550000.0,Bob,10,
