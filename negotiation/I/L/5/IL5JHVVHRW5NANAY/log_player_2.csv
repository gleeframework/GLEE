"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  There are 9 rounds remaining, so there's time to explore a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counteroffer:** A $150,000 reduction from Alice's opening offer is a substantial move, showing serious negotiation intent.
* **Appealing to Value:** Mentioning the product's value to Alice reinforces the idea of a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** $950,000 is still above Alice's minimum, allowing for further negotiation in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is closer to my ideal price range, it's still above my budget. I have 7 rounds remaining and the opportunity to negotiate further. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to offer $987,500. This is a fair compromise that allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my budget.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 987500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Move:**  Offering $987,500 is a smaller increment than the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise while still being within my budget.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  Highlighting the ""fair compromise"" and ""reasonable profit"" for Alice reinforces the idea of a win-win situation.
* **Time Pressure:**  With 6 rounds remaining, a slight increase in the offer could lead to a deal sooner rather than risking further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $987,500 is a tempting offer, I'm still confident this product is worth more.  How about $1,005,000? This slight adjustment reflects its true potential while acknowledging your budget considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,005,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,005,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer, $1,005,000 is still above my budget.  I have 5 rounds left, and I'm confident I can negotiate a lower price. I'll counteroffer once again to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're definitely narrowing the gap.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again. How about $1,000,000? This would allow us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  Offering $1,000,000 splits the difference between my previous offer and Alice's current offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** The message emphasizes reaching a ""satisfying"" deal, creating a positive atmosphere for negotiation.
* **Urgency:**  With only 4 rounds left, suggesting a final decision (""Let's make this happen!"") increases the pressure to reach an agreement."
