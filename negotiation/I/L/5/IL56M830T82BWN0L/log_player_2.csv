"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is better than $12,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're bringing to the table. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $8,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's below his maximum budget of $12,000, and it's closer to his ideal price of $7,500. Accepting the offer allows Bob to get the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiation that could lead to a higher price or a deal with John."
