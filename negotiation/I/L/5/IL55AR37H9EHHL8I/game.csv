"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you see the value, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we split the difference from our previous positions and settle at $1,025,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $1,025,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be willing to agree on $980,000?",980000.0,Bob,4,
