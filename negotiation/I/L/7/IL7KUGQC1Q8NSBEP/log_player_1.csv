Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it will be highly valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While starting high, offering it for $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, still netting you a good profit.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John provides a safety net. This allows you to confidently aim high with Bob."
