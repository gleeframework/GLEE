Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a price that is higher than what it's worth to him, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me some room to negotiate if he rejects the offer, while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $105. This is a compromise between my previous offer and his counteroffer.  It's still a bit higher than what the product is worth to him, but it's closer to his price, which might make him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm starting to run out of time and negotiation space. It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John than risk getting a lower offer from Bob."
