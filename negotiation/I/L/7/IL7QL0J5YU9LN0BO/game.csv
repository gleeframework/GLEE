,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about $90? I'm willing to meet you halfway.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit far from $90. Would you be willing to go down to $87.50? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer.,87.5,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not willing to go up to $89. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $88? I'm really interested in buying this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",88.0,Bob,6,
