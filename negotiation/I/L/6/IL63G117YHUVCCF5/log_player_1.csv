"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for a price of $1,200,000. It's a significant opportunity, and I believe it holds great value for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:** Starting at $1,200,000 is a high opening offer that leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** The message highlights the potential value of the product to Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation without immediately jumping to the ""John"" option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal is to maximize profit:**  $900,000 is significantly lower than my starting offer and still doesn't reflect the true value of the product.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's counteroffer is lower, it shows he's interested. There's room for further negotiation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John immediately guarantees $800,000, but the potential to get more from Bob is worth the risk of continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm not able to go that low at this time.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This price reflects the unique value of this product and still leaves room for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's keep the conversation going."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** The counteroffer is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's, showing a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Reiterate value:**  Emphasizing the product's uniqueness and potential value to Bob helps him understand the justification for the price.
* **Maintain momentum:** The message encourages further negotiation and keeps the deal moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying above the ""John"" price:**  $950,000 is still closer to my ideal outcome than John's offer of $800,000.
* **Room for further negotiation:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, there's still potential to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Risk assessment:** With several rounds remaining, the risk of rejecting Bob's offer is outweighed by the possibility of getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm still confident that this product can provide significant value for you. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This offer still reflects the unique value of this product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight compromise:**  This counteroffer lowers the price by $50,000, demonstrating flexibility. 
* **Focus on value and benefit:**  The message re-emphasizes the product's value and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Keep negotiation open:**  This counteroffer leaves room for Bob to make a final counteroffer before considering the ""John"" option."
