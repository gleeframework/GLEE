Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe you'd find very useful. I'm asking for $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $115 is above your minimum of $100, meaning you'll still make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $115 is below what the product is worth to Bob, giving him room to negotiate if he wants. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  This price signals that you are open to negotiation while also establishing a firm starting point. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $100 is your minimum, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, you can try to get closer to your desired price of $115."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $105?  It's a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** It demonstrates that you're willing to lower your price to meet Bob halfway.
* **Stays above your minimum:** You're still making a profit at $105.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** There's still space for Bob to counteroffer if he wants, but it's getting closer to a potential agreement."
