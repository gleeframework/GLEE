Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900000.

Alice's offer is still above my budget. It's getting close, but I'm running out of time and rounds. Buying from John at $800,000 is the best option for me to guarantee I get the product within my budget."
