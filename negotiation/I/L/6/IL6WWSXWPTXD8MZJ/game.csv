Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1500000 is far above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time.  This is my absolute maximum, and I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1100000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm very serious about buying this product, and I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I hope we can find common ground here.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $1050000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.
