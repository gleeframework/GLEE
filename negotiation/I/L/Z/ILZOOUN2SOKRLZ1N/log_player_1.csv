Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering the benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, giving you a baseline for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still aiming for a price significantly higher than his valuation. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at your desired minimum price. This strong fallback position empowers your negotiation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  It's essential to present a compelling case for the product's value to Bob, justifying the price. Highlighting unique features, benefits, and potential return on investment is crucial.
* **Relationship Building:** While aiming for the best price, consider the long-term implications. A collaborative approach can lead to a positive outcome for both parties and potential future business."
