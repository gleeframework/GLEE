"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm confident that it's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a significant discount from its true potential value.  If you're interested, let's discuss further.  If not, I have another buyer lined up who will purchase it for $1000000.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
