"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I'm ready to close the deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While I understand your perspective, $850,000 is a significant drop from my initial proposal. The value this product brings is substantial, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This acknowledges your interest while reflecting the product's true worth.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and demonstrates my commitment to closing this deal. I'm confident that this price reflects the value of the product to me while also being fair to you.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle at $887,500? This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value and your interest.",887500.0,Alice,5,
