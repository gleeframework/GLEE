Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from its true value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to make him more motivated to negotiate. 
* **Room for Counteroffer:**  $900,000 is a good starting point for a negotiation.  It's higher than my minimum, but I expect Bob will counteroffer. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  This price is still significantly higher than John's offer, giving me a solid fallback option if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Better Deal:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, there's still potential to get a better price. He clearly values the product at $1,000,000, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **Avoiding a Loss:**  Accepting Bob's offer would mean missing out on a potential $50,000 in profit.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  I'll make a counteroffer closer to my initial price, aiming to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm not giving in completely to Bob's price, demonstrating that I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* **Keeping the Negotiation Moving:**  This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise that hopefully leads to a swift resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $860000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Difference:** Bob's offer is only $10,000 less than my last counteroffer.  There's minimal room for further negotiation.
* **Near Minimum:**  The price is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $800,000.
* **Time and Risk:**  Continuing the negotiation could prolong the process and risk Bob backing out entirely. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a sale that's close to my desired price and avoiding the risk of losing the deal altogether."
