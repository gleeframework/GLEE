Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000.  It's in excellent condition and I believe it's a great deal for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, giving me room to negotiate down.
* **Value proposition:**  I'm highlighting the product's quality to incentivize Bob to accept the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending the message with an open-ended question, making it clear that I'm willing to discuss the price further.

**Important Notes:**

* This is just an initial offer. The negotiation process will be dynamic, and I'll need to adapt my strategy based on Bob's responses.
* I'm aware of the backup option of selling to John for $15,000. This will influence my decisions during the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested. There's still potential for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as a safety net:**  I'm comfortable rejecting Bob's offer because I know I can sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations fail. This gives me leverage in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 15500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within range:** I'm proposing a price that's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider my counteroffer.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to maintain a good rapport with Bob.
* **Open to discussion:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by suggesting we find ""common ground.""

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a price that's close to my minimum acceptable price while also being attractive enough for Bob to consider.
* I'm willing to compromise slightly, but I'm not willing to go too low.
* I'm keeping John as a backup option, which gives me confidence in my bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down. I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  Could you do $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $14,000 is only $1,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I recognize that Bob might not be willing to go higher.  Accepting his offer allows for potential future negotiation with him, as he's clearly interested in the product.
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming and potentially lead to a stalemate. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and prevents the risk of losing him as a buyer.
* **John as a safety net:**  Even though I'm accepting Bob's offer, I still have John as a backup buyer, providing me with security in case the deal with Bob falls through."
