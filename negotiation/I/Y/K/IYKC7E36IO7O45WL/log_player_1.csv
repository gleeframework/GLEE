Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. Bob values the product at $15,000, so he has a reason to consider this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, I can likely do better.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $13,500. This is a compromise, but still gives me a decent profit. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in the product and accept this offer."

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob is firm on $13,000 and I've already had a chance to make a counteroffer.  Selling to Bob for $13,000 is a better deal than selling to John for $12,000."
