"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to pay closer to $8,500, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,200 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,800?  I'm confident we can reach a deal that benefits both of us.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,800. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think about my bottom line. How about we try $9,100? I'm willing to give you a bit of a discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too.",9100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  I'm still a bit above my target price, but I'm willing to go to $8,900.  I think this is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal.",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're really close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $8,900, but I'd like to make one more concession. How about we do $8,950? I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",8950.0,Alice,7,
