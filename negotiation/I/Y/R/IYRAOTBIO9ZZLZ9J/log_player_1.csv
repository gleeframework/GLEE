"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price. I would like to propose an offer of $1,200,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  There are still rounds left, and I want to explore if I can get closer to my desired price. I'm also aware of John's offer, giving me a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 is still quite a bit below what this product is truly worth. To demonstrate my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I must stick to my budget. I am proposing an offer of $1,500,000. This is the maximum I can afford without compromising other business needs. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it aligns with John's offer. Accepting this deal ensures I get my desired price without risking further negotiation or losing the sale entirely."
