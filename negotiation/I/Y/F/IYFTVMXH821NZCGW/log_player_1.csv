Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $700000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd like to offer you $650000 for it.  This is a fair price considering your value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000.
