"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. This is a great deal, as you know the product is worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's best to see if she'll go lower. You know you have John as a backup, and $120 is still a significant chunk above Alice's perceived value."
