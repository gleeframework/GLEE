"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and presenting the price as a good deal. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counter, encouraging him to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** This price gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, but still allows for a good profit.

**Note:**  This is just my initial offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's initial offer is low, there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to meet him halfway and see if we can reach a compromise.
* **Selling to John is still an option:** I haven't ruled out selling to John for $15,000 yet. This option remains available if the negotiation with Bob fails. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price that is closer to his offer but still above my minimum. I'll also try to emphasize the value of the product and the benefits of closing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and meet him halfway.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and highlighting the ""great deal"" aspect for him.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language and emphasizing a win-win situation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer still leaves room for further negotiation, depending on Bob's response.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects my counteroffer, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer, try a different approach, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another offer. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to make it work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the deal:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Time is running out:** We are already in round 4, and every round that passes makes selling to John for $15,000 more attractive.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, there's a risk that we won't reach an agreement, and I'll be forced to sell to John for $15,000, missing out on a potential profit of $5,000.

**Conclusion:**  While $10,000 is less than my ideal price, it's a good deal given the circumstances and the risk of not closing a deal. It's better to secure a profit of $5,000 now than to risk getting nothing by continuing negotiations."
