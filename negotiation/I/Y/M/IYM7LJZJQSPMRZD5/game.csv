"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another offer. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to make it work.",10000.0,Bob,4,
