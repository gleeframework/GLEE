"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being higher than the product's value to me. It's a bold opening that might encourage Bob to counteroffer quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than the product's value to me and to Bob.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round to try to get a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $13,000. This is still a good price for me, but it shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate. It's also a price point closer to his counteroffer, encouraging him to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,200 is only slightly below the product's value to me. It's worth accepting this offer, as it's close to my minimum and I'm not sure if we'll get closer.  It's also more than I'd get selling to John."
