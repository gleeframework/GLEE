"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $750,000 falls short of what I believe is fair. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. I think this price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but I still think $925,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer and is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to push a bit further to see if I can get closer to $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $890,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true value of what's being offered."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still not comfortable with $890,000. I'm willing to meet you at $860,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While I'd prefer a price closer to $900,000, Bob's offer of $860,000 is a reasonable compromise. Accepting now ensures I get a good price without risking further negotiation that might not land much higher."
