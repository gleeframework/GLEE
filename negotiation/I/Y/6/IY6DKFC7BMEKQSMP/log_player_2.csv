"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. What do you think?

Alice's first offer is closer to your maximum price than it is to her minimum. There's room for negotiation here."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a little too high for my budget. Could you do any better on the price?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming for a better deal. Let's keep negotiating."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the new offer.  I appreciate you being willing to work with me. $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you consider $8,500?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $8,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8,800. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling this is her final offer. While we could push for a slightly lower price, the difference is now relatively small and we risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting at $8,800 secures a good price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at $12,000."
