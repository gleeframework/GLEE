"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While your initial offer is a bit too low, I'm willing to move closer to your range. To find a compromise, I propose a price of $1,900,000.  This reflects the product's exceptional potential and allows us both to benefit significantly.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,900,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to offer $1,500,000, which reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
