"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the substantial return on investment you'll experience."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** The message highlights the product's ""unique value"" and ""potential,"" subtly justifying the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrasing ""initially proposing"" and ""starting point for negotiations"" signals that I'm open to discussing the price.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize potential profit:**  Even if Bob negotiates down, starting high increases the likelihood of a final price well above my minimum.
2. **Understand Bob's position:** His response will reveal how eager he is to buy and how much he might be willing to pay.

Remember, I always have John as a backup, ensuring I won't settle for less than $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1,200,000, reflecting the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is above his perceived value but still significantly below my minimum of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to secure a deal quickly, I have room to negotiate and aim for a better outcome.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price, especially since I have John as a guaranteed backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While your initial offer is a bit too low, I'm willing to move closer to your range. To find a compromise, I propose a price of $1,900,000.  This reflects the product's exceptional potential and allows us both to benefit significantly."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've reduced my price by $400,000, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. However, the new price is still significantly above both his offer and my minimum.
* **Justification:**  I'm reinforcing the product's value to justify the price, using phrases like ""exceptional potential"" and ""allows us both to benefit.""
* **Encouraging a Counter:** By stating I'm ""willing to move closer,"" I encourage Bob to make another offer, ideally bridging the gap further.

I believe this approach balances firmness on price with a willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,900,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to offer $1,500,000, which reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches my minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. While I might have been able to push for a slightly higher price, accepting now guarantees the best possible outcome in this scenario. There's no guarantee Bob would go higher, and I risk losing him as a buyer if I counter again."
