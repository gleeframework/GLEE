"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know is of great value to your business.  I'm asking $1,000,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price given its potential benefit to you.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price given the market value of similar products.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the unique value this product offers. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, but this is a significant concession on my part. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $900,000, which would be $850,000. Can we discuss this further?",850000.0,Bob,4,
