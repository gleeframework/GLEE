"I'm really interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $1,200,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and shows my commitment to working with you.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,700,000, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one. Let's settle at $1,550,000. This is the best I can do, and it's still a great price for you. Let me know what you think.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
