"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1750000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which still reflects the value this product offers.  Let's meet halfway and see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1200000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget limitations.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $950000 is still below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise one more time. Let's meet at $1100000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a great deal.  If we can agree on this, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I may need to explore other options.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $1100000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1000000.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints.  I truly believe this is a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this and move forward.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and see your desire to reach a deal.  However, $1000000 simply isn't enough to cover the value of this product.  I'm willing to consider $1250000 as a final compromise. This price recognizes both the value of the product and your budget constraints.  Let's close this deal and make this happen.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
