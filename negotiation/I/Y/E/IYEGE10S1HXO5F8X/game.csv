"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000 for this product.  Would you be willing to consider that?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to spend closer to $1,000,000, but I have to consider my own valuation of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering it to you for $1,350,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you is $1,500,000.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing me to secure the product and you to get a good deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my minimum acceptable price. I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. It's a fair price, considering the value you place on the product and my own valuation.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering your valuation and my budget. This would allow us both to get a good deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
