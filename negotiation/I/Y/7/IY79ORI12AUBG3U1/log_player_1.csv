"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:**  By offering $100, I leave room for Bob to counteroffer and for us to eventually reach a price that's mutually acceptable. 
* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit, but I also want to avoid losing the deal entirely.  I'm prepared to accept lower offers, but I'll be watching my profit margin closely. 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing I can sell to John for $120 gives me leverage and allows me to be more assertive in my negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $85 is closer to his perceived value than mine. I'm not ready to accept that yet. 
* **Profit Margin:**  While $85 is better than nothing, it's not enough for me to make a good profit. I want to try to squeeze more out of this deal.
* **Negotiation:**  I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm going to reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.
* **John's Offer:** I'm aware I can sell to John for $120, which gives me a strong negotiating position. However, I'm still willing to try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to let it go for $92.50.  This way, we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This is a common tactic in negotiation. I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise and can be seen as a reasonable and fair gesture. 
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:**  $92.50 is still a respectable profit for me, even though it's lower than my initial goal. 
* **Moving Closer to a Deal:** By offering a price closer to Bob's, I'm increasing the likelihood that we'll reach an agreement in the next round. 
* **John's Offer in Mind:** While I'm aware of John's offer, I'm still committed to negotiating with Bob if possible. I believe I can get a better price from him by continuing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $88 for it. This feels like a fair price considering my budget. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $88 is getting closer to my ideal price, it's still a bit lower than I want to accept.
* **Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to take a slight risk to try and get a better price.
* **John's Offer:** While selling to John for $120 is tempting, I'm not yet willing to give up on getting a better deal with Bob. I'm still confident I can improve on $88.
* **Counteroffer:**  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle.  

I'm not yet at a point where I'm willing to accept a profit margin that is too low for me. I'm committed to exploring all possible options to maximize my earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $90 for the product. This way, we both get a good deal, and I can make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding the Middle Ground:** This round, I'm choosing to split the difference once again.  My last offer was $92.50, and Bob's was $88, so $90 feels like a reasonable compromise.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  I'm aware that I could sell to John for $120, but I'm still prioritizing a deal with Bob. I believe that getting $90 is a good outcome, and I'm willing to take a slight risk to close the deal.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that we both get a good deal with this price.  I'm trying to appeal to his sense of fairness and make it clear that this is a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Time Running Out:** With only five rounds left, it's getting more important to reach a deal.  I'm demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $90.  I'm willing to go up to $89. This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $89
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's final offer of $89 is still below my minimum acceptable price, even though it's a small increase from his previous offer. 
* **John's Offer:** I'm getting closer to the point where John's offer becomes more appealing.  I only have four rounds left, and I'm not sure I can get a better price from Bob.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** I'm weighing the risk of rejecting Bob's offer and potentially losing the deal against the potential reward of getting a higher price.  
* **Next Round:**  I'm going to make one more counteroffer in the next round to try and bridge the gap. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely move forward with selling to John. 

I'm trying to push for a higher price while remaining realistic about the possibility of selling to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $89 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $90.  This is really my final offer.  If you're not able to meet me there, I'll have to consider selling to someone else."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer. This creates a sense of urgency and puts pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Slight Compromise:** I'm making a small compromise by dropping to $90. This shows flexibility and increases the likelihood of Bob accepting.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I'm reminding Bob that I have other options, specifically mentioning selling to John. This reinforces my position and makes Bob more likely to reconsider.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only three rounds remaining, the time pressure is increasing. I need to reach a deal soon or risk losing the opportunity.
* **Balancing Risk:** I'm still aiming for a price closer to my ideal, but I'm also recognizing the possibility that I might not get it. I'm trying to balance the risk of losing the deal with the potential reward of a slightly higher price."
