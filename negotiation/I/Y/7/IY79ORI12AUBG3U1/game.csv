"Hi Alice, $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to let it go for $92.50.  This way, we both get a fair deal.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $88 for it. This feels like a fair price considering my budget. What do you say?",88.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $90 for the product. This way, we both get a good deal, and I can make a fair profit.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $90.  I'm willing to go up to $89. This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",89.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $89 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $90.  This is really my final offer.  If you're not able to meet me there, I'll have to consider selling to someone else.",90.0,Alice,7,
