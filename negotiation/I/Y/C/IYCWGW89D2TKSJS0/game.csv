"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  How about $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal today.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,250? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal at this price.",10750.0,Bob,4,
