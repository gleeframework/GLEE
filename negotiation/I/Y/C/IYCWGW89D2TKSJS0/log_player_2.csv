"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can do better than $12,000. You are willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice values the product at $15,000.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer lets you try to get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  How about $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,250? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,250 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You can likely still negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting allows you to make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to your $10,000 limit."
