"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. I think it's a fair price considering its quality and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $120, and John is selling it for that price, there's no point in negotiating with Alice. There's a chance you could get a lower price from Alice, but there's also a chance she'll reject your counteroffers and you'll end up paying more or wasting time. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your maximum price point."
