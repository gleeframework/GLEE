"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's below your estimated value, there's still room for negotiation.  
* **You want to save more:**  You can likely get a better price by rejecting and making a counteroffer.

This strategy keeps the negotiation open and allows you to potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000. This would give you a good profit and would be a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive, but reasonable:** This offer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your desire for a deal but not being unreasonable.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** The message emphasizes a fair deal for both parties, making it more likely for Alice to consider. 
* **Room for compromise:** There's still some wiggle room to negotiate further if Alice rejects this counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900000 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950000, which still leaves room for you to make a good profit. Let's meet in the middle on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:**  Alice has come down from her initial offer, and $950,000 is a good compromise point. 
* **Value still intact:** While it's not the absolute lowest price you could potentially get, it still leaves you with a significant savings compared to buying from John.
* **Time is a factor:**  You've already gone through a couple of rounds, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal or having Alice become less willing to compromise. 

Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price without risking a further stalemate or losing the opportunity altogether."
