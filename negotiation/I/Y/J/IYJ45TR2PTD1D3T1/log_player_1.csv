I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, aiming for a good profit. If he rejects, we can negotiate further.  However, I'm always aware that I can sell to John for $8,000, so I won't go too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, but it's still closer to my valuation than John's offer. I'll counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}

I'm willing to drop my price a bit, but I'm still aiming for a decent profit.  This price is a compromise, and hopefully, Bob will find it acceptable."

Bob's offer is getting increasingly low, and I'm not willing to go lower than $8,000.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
