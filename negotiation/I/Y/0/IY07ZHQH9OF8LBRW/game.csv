"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Could you consider a lower price point? I'd be willing to pay $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $950,000 to be comfortable. Can you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, I'd like to throw in an additional incentive to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5% discount on the purchase price if you're willing to make a decision today. Would you consider $760,000?",760000.0,Alice,5,
