Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product, which might make Bob reconsider his initial valuation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** Great! I've made a good profit.
* **If Bob Rejects:** I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer based on his offer and how much time I want to spend negotiating.
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a backup buyer provides security. If negotiations with Bob fall apart, I have a guaranteed sale at my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8500 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $12,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** Having John's offer of $12,000 gives me a strong bargaining position. I can use it to push Bob closer to a price that's more acceptable to me.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob that's higher than his offer but lower than my initial price. This will show him that I'm willing to negotiate but also maintain a good price for myself. 
* **Monitoring Time:** I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John if negotiations with Bob become too time-consuming."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about $9,500?  That's a fair compromise that still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Profit:**  $9,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  This ensures I don't lose money on the sale. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Great! I've secured a good price.
* **Bob Rejects:**  I'll consider his next counteroffer. If it's too low, I might need to move on to John.
* **Time Management:** I'll be mindful of how much time I'm spending on this negotiation.  I'll need to weigh the potential gains against the time investment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $9000, which is the highest I can go. Can we make it work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  While $9,000 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Time is Money:**  We've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  Continuing to negotiate further risks losing time and potentially a sale altogether.
* **Potential for Future Business:**  Accepting Bob's offer could potentially lead to future business opportunities with him.

**Next Steps:**

* **Proceed with the Sale:**  I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the transaction. 
* **Potential for Future Deals:** I'll keep Bob in mind for future sales opportunities, especially if he is happy with this purchase."
