"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire [product name] at a price that's below its true market value. I know this product would be a valuable asset to your operations, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let's discuss a price that's fair to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
