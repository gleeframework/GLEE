"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,800,000."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations with an ambitious offer. This anchors the discussion at a higher point and leaves room for potential concessions. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** The initial offer is significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This will give you valuable information about Bob's eagerness and flexibility.  
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind that you have the option to walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000 at any time. This strengthens your position in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am not able to pay such a high price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than your initial ask. Rejecting this offer sends a clear message that you're serious about achieving a higher price. You're willing to negotiate, but not at the expense of a substantial profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it falls significantly short of what I had in mind. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,700,000?"",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While rejecting Bob's offer indicates firmness, a large counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving. 
* **Targeting the Midpoint:**  This counteroffer aims for a price point closer to your initial ask while still acknowledging Bob's counter. It encourages him to consider a compromise within a more agreeable range.
* **Maintaining Strength:** We're still significantly above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, demonstrating continued confidence in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I still believe we can find a better solution. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 represents a significant profit margin over your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating a serious interest in closing the deal.  
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging the negotiation further carries the risk of smaller concessions from Bob. Accepting now secures a substantial profit without unnecessary delays."
