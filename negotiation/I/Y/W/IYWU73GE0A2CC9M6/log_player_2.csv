"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's potential to save more.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price.  It's risky, but the potential reward of a lower price outweighs the potential loss of getting a better price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  He starts with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for negotiation.  The goal is to push Alice towards a lower price while still leaving room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, but there is still room for negotiation.  Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price, and rejecting this offer keeps that goal alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's raised his offer from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise, but he's still below Alice's current offer. This strategy aims to create a sense of urgency and encourage Alice to accept a price closer to Bob's ideal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,175,000 is a significant improvement from her initial price, and it's very close to Bob's last counteroffer.  At this point, the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of Alice walking away or Bob losing out on a good deal.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price well below his maximum limit."
