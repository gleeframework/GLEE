"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture a significant portion of the potential surplus value.  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, this offer is still attractive to him, leaving him with $3,000 in potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll reject this offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while demonstrating that I'm confident in the value of the product.  This price also provides a good balance between maximizing profit and ensuring the deal is likely to close."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now higher than selling to John, and  it's getting closer to my ideal price.  I'm accepting the offer to secure the sale and avoid risking further negotiation rounds that could lead to a lower final price."
