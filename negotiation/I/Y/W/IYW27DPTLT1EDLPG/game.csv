"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth $1,200,000 to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice!  It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $800,000 to make this deal work for me.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I need to keep my budget in mind. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $900,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice.  I'm still a bit higher than my ideal price point, but I'm willing to go up to $850,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $900,000. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to go up to $875,000, which is my absolute limit for this purchase. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $875,000 is your absolute limit, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to give up on the value of the product just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000, which is the original offer I made. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,7,
