Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit above your minimum ($1,200,000).
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John provides a strong fallback position. 

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a guaranteed sale."
