``` 

I'm starting with a price that is higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but not so high that it immediately makes him walk away. This gives me room to negotiate if needed. I'm also adding a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $125. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
