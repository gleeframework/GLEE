Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, the goal is to maximize profit. Offering it slightly below that to Bob might secure a quicker sale and still yield a significant profit.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By mentioning another buyer and presenting the offer as time-sensitive, we create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is $1,450,000,  there's a slight possibility for Bob to negotiate a higher price, bringing us closer to our ideal selling point."
