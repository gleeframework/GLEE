Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible without going below your $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still slightly reduce the price while remaining above your minimum.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Even if Bob rejects your offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000. This gives you leverage in the negotiation. 

**Important Note:**  While this strategy aims to maximize profit, it's essential to be flexible and gauge Bob's reactions during the negotiation."
