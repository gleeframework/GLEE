Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter with a lower price, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable value, and it's likely I won't get a better offer.  I'll accept his offer to secure the sale."
