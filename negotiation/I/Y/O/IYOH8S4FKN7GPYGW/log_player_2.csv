"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still within your budget and there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to get a lower price from Alice.  You can potentially save $100,000 or more by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer of $900,000, but it still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.  It also shows a willingness to negotiate seriously, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $920,000 is higher than your initial counteroffer of $850,000. While you could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice getting more stubborn and raising the price further is high. At this point, buying from John for $1,000,000 ensures you get the product within your budget, even if it's not the ideal price."
