Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 900000} 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to me, hoping to maximize my profit. I'm confident Bob will be interested, as the product is worth $800,000 to him.  Let's see what he offers!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for less than $800,000, which is the product's value to me. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still need to ensure I get at least $800,000. This price is a fair compromise considering both of our interests. Let's see if Bob agrees."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially losing more money. Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees I get my minimum desired value."
