"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe holds significant value for you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I appreciate your perspective on the value. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,200,000 is a significant step down from where we started.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  This recognizes the value you've highlighted while still reflecting the true worth of what I'm offering.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Alice, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $1,250,000? I think this is a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find common ground. It seems like we both see the value here.  To bridge the gap, I'm prepared to come down slightly.  How about $1,300,000? This reflects my commitment to making this work while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,275,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
