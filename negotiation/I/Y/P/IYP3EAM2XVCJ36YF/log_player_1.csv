"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe holds significant value for you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** We don't want to start at Bob's maximum, leaving space for negotiation and counteroffers.
* **Polite and Professional Tone:**  We maintain a collaborative tone to foster a positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower:** While $1,200,000 is a good profit, it's a substantial drop from our initial ask and still leaves a lot of potential money on the table. 
* **We have time and leverage:** It's only round 2, and we have eight more rounds to negotiate. Plus, Bob clearly sees value in the product. 
* **John's offer is our safety net:**  We can always fall back on John's $1,000,000 offer if negotiations with Bob completely stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I appreciate your perspective on the value. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,200,000 is a significant step down from where we started.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  This recognizes the value you've highlighted while still reflecting the true worth of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, But Hold Ground:** We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and willingness to negotiate but hold firm that our product is worth more than his initial offer.
* **Strategic Compromise:** Meeting in the middle at $1,350,000 signals a willingness to compromise but maintains a strong position, aiming for a price point closer to our target.
* **Justification:** We reiterate the product's value proposition to justify the higher price, reminding Bob of the benefits he gains from this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, Alice, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $1,250,000? I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow but Steady Progress:** Bob is moving closer to our desired price range with each offer, even if it's incremental. Rejecting this keeps the negotiation moving in the right direction.
* **Still Room for Negotiation:** We have six rounds remaining, and Bob consistently expresses interest. There's a good chance he'll go higher. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  We're not in a desperate situation yet. Holding onto the product for a potentially much higher price is still the stronger strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find common ground. It seems like we both see the value here.  To bridge the gap, I'm prepared to come down slightly.  How about $1,300,000? This reflects my commitment to making this work while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We make a smaller price reduction this time ($50,000 instead of $100,000) to signal that we're getting closer to our bottom line.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  We continue to frame the negotiation as mutually beneficial, emphasizing that we're seeking a fair agreement for both sides.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** We keep the negotiation moving by making a counteroffer, showing Bob that we're actively engaged in finding a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,275,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit Margin:** While not our ideal price, $1,275,000 is still a significant profit ($275,000) over our minimum and a healthy return. 
* **Bob's Commitment:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, demonstrating a strong interest in the product. It's unlikely he'll jump significantly higher.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging the negotiation further for potentially smaller gains might not be the most efficient use of time.  Selling now provides immediate capital. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's always the risk Bob could walk away if we push too hard. Accepting now secures a very good deal and avoids that potential loss."
