You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's lower than Alice's initial value, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to his maximum budget as possible.  Offering $8,500 is a significant drop from Alice's offer and shows Bob's serious intent to negotiate, but it leaves some room for Alice to counter without feeling like she's losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget. He has 7 more rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better price.  There's no need to rush into an agreement just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing that he's willing to compromise, moving closer to Alice's offer. $9,000 is still within his budget and gives Alice room to counter without feeling like she's giving away too much. This continues to build towards a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer. With only 5 rounds left, the risk of further negotiation failing and having to buy from John for $8,000 is increasing. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product for a reasonable price without risking a worse outcome."
