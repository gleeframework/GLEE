"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $13500.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $11500 for the product. Can you consider that?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you have a budget, but $11500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $12500? It's a fair compromise and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not comfortable with $12500. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $12000, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about $11800?",11800.0,Bob,6,
