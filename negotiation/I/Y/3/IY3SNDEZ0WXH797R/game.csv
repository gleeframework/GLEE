"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm really interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit closer to my budget. Would you be willing to do $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to your budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I've got to make a living, and $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is my best price, but I think you'll find it's still a great value for the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking to get closer to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out on too much. I'm counteroffering at $10,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's the best compromise we can reach.",10250.0,Alice,5,
