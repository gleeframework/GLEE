"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, as it's worth $1,200,000 to you.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best strategy to achieve Bob's goal."
