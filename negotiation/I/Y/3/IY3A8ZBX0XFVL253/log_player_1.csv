"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of its worth to him. This might encourage him to accept a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message conveys that I'm open to negotiating, which could lead to a more amicable and successful outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Could you do it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than my minimum acceptable price of $80, I still have room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price. I believe I can secure a better deal by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to come down to $110. This is still a great price considering the product's value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering with $110, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping it will encourage him to accept a higher price.
* **Flexibility:** I'm emphasizing my willingness to negotiate, showing that I'm open to reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $105 is very close to my desired price range. I have already made a couple of concessions and further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price. It's important to be realistic about the potential gains versus the risk of losing the deal completely. Accepting this offer will ensure a profitable sale, and I still have enough rounds to potentially make a better deal with another buyer if needed."
