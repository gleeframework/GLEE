Round 5

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down in price, but she is still significantly above your maximum budget of $800,000.  At this point, it's unlikely she'll come down to a price that works for you.  John offers a guaranteed price that fits within your budget, making it the safer and more economical choice."
