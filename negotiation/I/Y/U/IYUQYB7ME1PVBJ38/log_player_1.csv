"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1400000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good chunk of the potential profit while leaving room for negotiation. This should give Bob an incentive to negotiate but also show my serious intent to sell to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept and secure a sale, I believe I can push for a higher price.  I still have 8 rounds to negotiate and can secure at least $1,000,000 from John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,300,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise but still want a significant portion of the potential profit. It's also a reasonable middle ground between my initial offer and his counteroffer, hopefully leading to a quicker agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I have six rounds left and can still secure at least $1,000,000 from John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,250,000. This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal and willing to compromise further.  This price is still a good profit margin for me, and hopefully, it will be enough to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm going to reject it and see if I can get closer to my desired price. I still have four rounds left and can sell to John for $1,000,000 if this deal falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer but still leaves a good profit margin for me. With only three rounds remaining, I need to secure a deal, and this price is a good compromise while still being within my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call. Bob's offer is at my minimum, but I'm running out of time, and I'm not confident I can get a higher price from Bob.  With only two rounds left, there's a good chance we won't reach an agreement.  Selling to John now ensures a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and prevents the risk of ending up with nothing."
