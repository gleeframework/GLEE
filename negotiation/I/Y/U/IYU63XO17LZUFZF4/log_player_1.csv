{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** $140 is more than the product is worth to Bob ($120), but still lower than the minimum you're willing to accept ($150).
* **It's a reasonable discount:**  Offering a 10% discount is generally considered a good starting point for negotiations.
* **It includes a friendly message:** This helps to create a positive atmosphere and encourages Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $130 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $120, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $132.50? Can you do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $132.5 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable with it.  I've already negotiated down from my initial asking price and I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum.  It's not worth risking losing John for a small gain. I'll sell to John and move on."
