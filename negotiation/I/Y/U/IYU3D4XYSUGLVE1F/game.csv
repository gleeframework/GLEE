"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000 for the product. Would that work for you?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my original asking price is more reflective of that. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $14,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we settle at $11,000? That's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for working with me.  I'm motivated to make a deal, but I need to get at least $12,000 for this product.  Would you be willing to agree to that?",12000.0,Alice,5,
