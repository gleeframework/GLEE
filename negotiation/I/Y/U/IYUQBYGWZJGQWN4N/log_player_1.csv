Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it allows for room to negotiate.  I'm aiming to maximize my profit while leaving space for potential concessions if Bob proves to be a serious buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting price, but it's still a decent amount. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I have 9 rounds left and there's still potential to negotiate."

I'm counteroffering at $1,700,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a good profit for me.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway.  If he's not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating."
