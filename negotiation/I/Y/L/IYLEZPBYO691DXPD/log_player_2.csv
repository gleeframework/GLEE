Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,250. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $7,250 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it down to $7,100. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident I'd be a satisfied customer."", ""product_price"": 7100}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues the negotiation, showing that you are actively trying to reach a deal but are still pushing for a lower price.  It's a small decrease from Alice's offer, demonstrating your willingness to meet halfway but not settling for more than you're willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,100. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $7,200. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made a significant concession, and her offer is very close to your desired price point. You've already made several counteroffers, and further negotiation may risk losing the deal altogether.  At this point, accepting the offer is the best course of action to secure the product for a reasonable price.  While you could try to haggle further, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential benefit of saving a few hundred dollars."
