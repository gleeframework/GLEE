{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He values the product at $12,000 and can get it from John for that price. There's room for negotiation with Alice, and he can potentially save money."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is slightly above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($10,000). This shows a willingness to negotiate while also aiming for a significant discount.  He's hoping Alice will be willing to compromise to close the deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can potentially get a better deal by continuing to counteroffer, especially since he has a fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, getting closer to Alice's price.  This is a calculated risk, as he's approaching his maximum price. However, he's hoping Alice will see this as a serious offer and be willing to accept to close the deal. If not, he still has the option to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached a point where Alice's offers are getting too close to his maximum.  He's only got a few rounds left, and there's a risk that he won't be able to secure a better deal.  He's also likely to be losing money at this point, as he's already above his initial target. 

It's better for Bob to cut his losses and buy from John, ensuring he gets the product while still staying within his budget."
