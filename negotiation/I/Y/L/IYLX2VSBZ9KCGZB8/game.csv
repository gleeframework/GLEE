"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1100000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950000. This is a fair price considering your desired selling point and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
