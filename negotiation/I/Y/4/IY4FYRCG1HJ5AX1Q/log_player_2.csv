"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic deal on this product.  I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. Given its value, I believe this is a very fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good deal, Bob can still potentially save more by negotiating with Alice.  He has a buffer of $1,000 before needing to buy from John, so it's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to get the best deal possible.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While your offer is reasonable, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,000. This is my final offer, as I'm confident I can find other buyers at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,000, which is within Bob's budget and a significant saving compared to buying from John.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will stick to her ""final offer"" and he'll end up paying $15,000 for the product.  Accepting the offer at $13,000 secures a good deal and avoids potential further negotiation complications."
