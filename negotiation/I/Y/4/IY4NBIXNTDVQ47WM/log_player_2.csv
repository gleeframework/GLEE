"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is better than John's offer of $15,000. Even though the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, it's still a good deal for Bob to get it for $14,000. This saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John."
