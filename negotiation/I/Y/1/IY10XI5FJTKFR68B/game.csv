"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $500000 is a bit low for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. After some internal discussions, I propose to sell the product for $800000. This is a fair compromise between our initial positions.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $800000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1000000? This would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
