"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit margin while leaving room for negotiation.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm going to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm reducing the price to $1,500,000, which is still a good profit for me. It's a reasonable compromise that might entice Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to settle for that price. I still have time and I'm going to see if I can get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm dropping the price to $1,300,000. This is getting closer to Bob's offer but still gives me a decent profit. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot that convinces Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting too low, and I'm running out of time. It's more beneficial for me to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a better outcome than settling for $1,000,000 from Bob."
