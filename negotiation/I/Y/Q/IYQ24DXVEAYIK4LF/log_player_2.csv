"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $600,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. After careful consideration, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $550,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the price lower, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $540,000. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $540,000.

Alice is signaling this is her final offer.  While I could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are getting smaller and I risk pushing Alice away entirely. Accepting $540,000 is a good deal compared to John's $800,000 price."
