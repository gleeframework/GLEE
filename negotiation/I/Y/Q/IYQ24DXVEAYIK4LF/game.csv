"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $600,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I'm hoping to find a price that works a little better for my budget.  Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. After careful consideration, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $550,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",550000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $550,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to land a little lower.  How about $525,000?",525000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the price lower, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $540,000. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",540000.0,Alice,5,
