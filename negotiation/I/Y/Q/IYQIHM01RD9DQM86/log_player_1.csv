Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I've looked closely at the product's value, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your business.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,025,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the true worth of what's being offered."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe reflects the true value of the product for me. Let's find a compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly demonstrating a willingness to move towards a higher price.  There's room for negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation.  How about we meet halfway at $1,000,000?  This demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable solution, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire to reach a middle ground. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. Let's try $985,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. I'm confident we can finalize a deal with this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

It's time to accept.  Bob is moving in smaller increments now, and while we might be able to squeeze out a few thousand more, it's not worth the risk of him lowering his offer or walking away. $985,000 is a strong price and a substantial profit."
