"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can do better.  While $950,000 is lower than what John is offering, there's still room to negotiate and get a lower price.  Bob has 10 rounds to work with, so it's worth exploring if he can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** Bob wants to start with a low counteroffer to show Alice he's serious about getting a good price.
* **Finding middle ground:**  The offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above Alice's minimum value, suggesting a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive message:** Bob's message is friendly and emphasizes finding a middle ground, which could encourage Alice to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay at this point. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob has several rounds left. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue bargaining and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also giving us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:**  Bob is raising his offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise. The small increase suggests he's getting closer to a deal.
* **Highlighting value:**  He's emphasizing that the price reflects the value of the product, appealing to Alice's sense of fairness.
* **Positive framing:** The message is still friendly and emphasizes a good deal for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. How about we split the difference and settle at $887,500?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $887,500 is very close to Bob's desired price range.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's getting late in the game.  There are only 5 rounds left.  If he rejects, Alice might get stubborn and refuse to budge, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most prudent decision at this point."
