Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm offering to sell the product for $950,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still reflects the value I place on the product.  I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, Bob's offer of $925,000 is now within a range I'm comfortable with. It's above my minimum acceptable price and a better deal than selling to John for $1,200,000. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal quickly and avoid further negotiation."
