Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. This is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but I believe there's room for negotiation. If he rejects, we can work towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll try to get a better price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering $85. This is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be agreeable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  It's not ideal, but it's a good deal for me. I'll accept it and sell the product to Bob."
