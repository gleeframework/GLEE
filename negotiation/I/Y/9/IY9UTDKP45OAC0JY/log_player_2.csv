Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing the value you place on this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle on $887,500? This reflects a willingness to compromise while still recognizing the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price.**  $887,500 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John.
* **There's a risk of going further.**  Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, and continuing to reject could lead to a stalemate or Alice becoming less flexible.  
* **Time is a factor.**  With only 5 rounds remaining, accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product without the risk of running out of time and having to buy from John at a higher price."
