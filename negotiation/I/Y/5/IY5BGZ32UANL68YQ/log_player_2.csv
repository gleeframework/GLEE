Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, and I'm offering you the product for $950,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $875,000 is still a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to offer you the product for $912,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we split the difference this time and go with $900,000?  I'm really hoping to close this deal with you, and I think this price is fair for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

At $900,000, we're getting very close to Alice's likely bottom line. While we might be able to squeeze out a bit more in further rounds, the potential savings are getting smaller.  Accepting now guarantees a good price and avoids the risk of the negotiation stalling and us having to default to John's higher price."
