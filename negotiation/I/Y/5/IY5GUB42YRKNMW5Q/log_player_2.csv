# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

You can definitely do better than $120.  You're willing to pay up to $150, but you should try to get a better price from Alice.  Let's see if we can negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

Alice has come down to $110, which is a good price for you. It's still within your budget, and it's a better deal than buying from John.  Let's take it!"
