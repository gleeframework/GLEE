"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000, a price that I think is very fair considering its value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I think $1,100,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product, but I'm still not convinced that $700,000 is enough. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll meet you at $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
