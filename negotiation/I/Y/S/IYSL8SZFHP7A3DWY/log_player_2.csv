Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm willing to compromise again. I'll sell the product to you for $130. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $130, and at this point, it's more beneficial to cut my losses and secure the product from John for $120."
