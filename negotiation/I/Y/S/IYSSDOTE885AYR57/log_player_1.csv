Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $750,000. I believe this represents a significant value for you, especially considering its potential.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $800,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price slightly below Bob's valuation ($750,000) gives him the perception of a deal while still leaving room for potential negotiation upwards.
* **Backup Plan (John):** We have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. This strong fallback position gives us leverage in negotiations with Bob. 

By starting the negotiation with a price that is appealing to Bob but still within a profitable range for us, we maximize our chances of securing a deal above our minimum acceptable price."
