Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it very useful. I'm asking $130 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $100. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for my minimum just yet. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a price that works for you. While I can't go as low as $100, I'm willing to come down to $115. Let's split the difference and make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
