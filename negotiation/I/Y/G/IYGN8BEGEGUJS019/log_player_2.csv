"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. While I can't divulge specifics just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $8000 to me. I'm offering it to you for $10000, giving you a potential for significant gain. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully. Let me know your decision! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same as John's. There is no benefit to buying from Alice. By rejecting, you can potentially negotiate a better price with John."
