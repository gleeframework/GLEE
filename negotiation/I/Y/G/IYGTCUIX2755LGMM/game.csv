"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me at the moment. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm confident you understand this product's true value and potential.  While I'm not prepared to go as low as $800,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000 to move this deal forward. This is a significant reduction on my part, demonstrating my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable solution.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,400,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This offer represents a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can close the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
