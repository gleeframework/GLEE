"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
