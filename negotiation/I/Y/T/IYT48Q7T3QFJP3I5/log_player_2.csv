{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth accepting Alice's offer, as you can get the same product from John for $8,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer gives you a chance to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

``` 

This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, showing you are serious about buying but also willing to pay a fair price.  It gives Alice some room to negotiate while still staying within your budget."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than John's price. While it's closer to your budget, it's worth seeing if you can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still above what you can get from John. You're close to your budget, but it's worth pushing for a better price. There are still rounds left to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7900}
```

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,050.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

While Alice's offer is tempting and getting closer to your budget, it's still not a good deal compared to John's offer.  You have limited rounds left, and it's unlikely Alice will come down much further.  Buying from John guarantees you the product at your desired price."
