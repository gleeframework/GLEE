"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum. I'm confident I can close the deal within 10 rounds, but I'll be prepared to accept John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm lowering my price to $175. This is still above my minimum, and hopefully shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also have a limit. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, and we can close the deal within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm running out of time, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $160.  This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I'm not willing to go much lower. With only 5 rounds left, the pressure is on, but I believe this is a reasonable offer for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  We are nearing the end of the negotiation, but I believe I can get a better price. I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

With only three rounds remaining, I'm taking a significant risk by lowering my offer to $155. However, this is my last counteroffer before I'm forced to accept John's offer.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my commitment to closing a deal with Bob, and he'll accept this final price."
