"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This price gives Bob an incentive to counteroffer and allows for a back-and-forth negotiation.
* **Staying Above My Minimum:**  $12,000 is significantly above my minimum of $15,000, so I'm not giving away too much value in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested. There's still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price. 
* **Time to Counter:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price that's more in line with my expectations and gives me more control over the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is far too low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that is halfway between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $6,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reinforce that $9,000 is a fair price.
* **Creating Urgency (Subtly):** By suggesting a ""fair price,"" I imply that this might be my final offer, putting a bit of pressure on Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you consider $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob is getting closer, $7,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for Better Deal:**  I'm confident that I can get a higher price with further negotiation.
* **Remaining Rounds:** I still have several rounds left to potentially increase the price. 
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer of $15,000 is tempting, I'm not desperate. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 just isn't enough.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still significantly less than my original price. If you're serious about buying this product, I think this is the best offer you'll get. "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price, but I'm still staying above my minimum. 
* **Urgency:**  I'm suggesting that this is the ""best offer"" to increase pressure on Bob to accept. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value, hinting that $8,500 is a fair price.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  I'm leaving some room for Bob to counter, but I'm hoping that the price is close enough to his budget for him to accept."
