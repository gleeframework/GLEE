Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$120** is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price ($80) but leaves room for negotiation and still offers Bob a good deal since it's lower than his perceived value ($150). 
* **The message** is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* This strategy balances the need to maximize my profit with the potential of losing Bob as a buyer and having to settle with John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $100?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm still aiming for a higher price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired $120. I can see if I can get a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is tempting, I need to recoup some of my investment.  How about $110?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$110** is a compromise: it's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. 
* **The message** remains friendly and focuses on finding a mutually beneficial solution, making Bob feel valued. 
* This strategy increases my chances of securing a sale closer to my desired price without risking losing Bob completely."
