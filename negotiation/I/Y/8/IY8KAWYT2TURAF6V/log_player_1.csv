Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give me valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. 
* **Backup Plan:**  I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, which serves as my safety net. This means I can afford to be a bit more ambitious with my initial offer to Bob."
