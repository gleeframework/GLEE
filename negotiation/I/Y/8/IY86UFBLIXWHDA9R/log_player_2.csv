"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a good price, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice's minimum acceptable price is $80.  There's room to find a price that benefits both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $95?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $95.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $102? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price of $110, and $102 is still within your budget of $120.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject another counteroffer, and you'll end up paying the full $120 to John.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product for a price that's reasonable and avoids potential delays."
