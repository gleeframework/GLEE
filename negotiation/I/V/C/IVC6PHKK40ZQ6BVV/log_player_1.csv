Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

This offer is a bit below what I value the product at, but it leaves room for negotiation and still offers Bob a decent price.  Since I can sell it to John for $1,500,000, I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I value the product at, and I believe I can get a better price. I will counteroffer him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous offer, but still keeping it above what Bob offered. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm confident I can push for a better price.  I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm willing to go slightly lower, but I'm still holding firm to my minimum price. I'm hoping this will be the final offer Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum, but it's still too low. I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and I don't want to risk getting stuck in an endless cycle.  I'd rather sell the product to John and ensure a profit that's closer to my initial valuation."
