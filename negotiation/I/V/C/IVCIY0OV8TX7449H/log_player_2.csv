Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested, $12,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price closer to my maximum budget. It signals that I'm serious but also leaves room for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll consider selling the product to you for $10500. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above my budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to go to $9,000.  It's a fair price, and I'd be ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer again moves closer to Alice's price, but it remains within my budget.  It's a clear signal that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also not going to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's the lowest I can go. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, and I'm concerned that we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. It's better to secure the product from John for $8,000 rather than risk getting stuck with a higher price from Alice."
