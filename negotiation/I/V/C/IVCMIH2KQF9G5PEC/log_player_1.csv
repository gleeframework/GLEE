"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This allows room for negotiation while still giving me a good starting point. I'm curious to see how Bob reacts to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $50 is way too low.  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price and doesn't reflect the value of the product. I will reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counter-offering with $175. This is still a good profit for me and is a more reasonable starting point for further negotiation. I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and Bob's initial low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $70 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not willing to sell the product at such a low price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price to $160. This is closer to Bob's last offer but still higher than my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm starting to feel the pressure with fewer rounds left, Bob's offer of $80 is still too low. I'm going to reject it and try one more counter-offer in the next round.  I'm hoping he'll start to see that I'm serious about getting a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm dropping my price to $155, just above my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value and the ongoing negotiations. I'm hoping Bob will finally agree to this offer."
