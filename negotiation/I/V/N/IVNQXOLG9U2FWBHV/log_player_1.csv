"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm using positive language to emphasize the deal's attractiveness.
* **Open to negotiation:** My message shows I'm open to discussion and encourages Bob to counteroffer. 

**Important note:**  I'm not immediately jumping to John's offer, as this strategy risks missing out on a potentially better price from Bob. I'll evaluate each round based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds available."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the deal, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Time to counteroffer:** I have 9 rounds left. I'm not going to sell to John just yet, as I can likely get a better price from Bob. 
* **Strategic counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap but keeping my minimum value in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above that price point. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** My counteroffer is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise and makes it seem like I'm genuinely trying to reach a deal.
* **Positive framing:** I'm using positive language like ""fair price"" and ""finalize this deal"" to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Not too aggressive:** I'm not dropping my price too much, keeping in mind my minimum value and the remaining rounds. 
* **Focus on closing the deal:**  I'm explicitly mentioning the goal of ""finalizing"" the deal to put pressure on Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose $10,000 as the price for the product. This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still acquiring the item I need. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $10,000 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **More rounds to negotiate:**  I have 7 rounds remaining. I'm not going to sell to John yet, as I can likely get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Strategic counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a price that works for both of us but still stays closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. However, $10,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250. This is a good compromise that allows me to cover my costs and gives you a great deal on the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to negotiate:** While Bob's offer is closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm using the remaining rounds to continue negotiating.
* **Splitting the difference (again):** My counteroffer is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **High-pressure language:**  I'm using phrases like ""close this deal"" and ""good compromise"" to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for Bob to make the offer more appealing.

I'm still aiming for a higher price but acknowledging Bob's constraints. With 6 rounds remaining, I'm confident I can get closer to my goal without risking the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. Based on my current budget, I am comfortable proposing $11,000 as the final price for the product. This would enable me to acquire the item without exceeding my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is getting closer:** While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still a bit lower than what I'd ideally want.
* **5 rounds remaining:** I have enough rounds left to keep negotiating without resorting to John's offer yet.
* **Aiming for a better price:** I believe I can push for a price closer to my minimum value with a few more rounds of negotiation.

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $11,500. This will help me find a balance between securing a good deal and keeping the negotiations moving forward."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still a bit above that price point.

Let's finalize this and move forward."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** My counteroffer is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.

* **Urgency and finality:**  I'm using phrases like ""finalize this"" and ""move forward"" to encourage Bob to accept and conclude the negotiations.

With only 4 rounds remaining, I'm trying to strike a balance between pushing for a higher price and ensuring a deal is reached."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest proposal carefully. I am willing to offer $11,200 as the final price for the product. This amount is reasonable for both parties and allows me to stay within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not there yet:**  While $11,200 is getting very close to my minimum, I still have 3 rounds left, and I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price.
* **Strategic counteroffer:** I believe I can still get a better offer from Bob, so I'll counteroffer again. 
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with a few more rounds of negotiation.

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price slightly higher than Bob's latest offer. This approach will give me the best chance of getting a price closer to my minimum value without risking the deal falling through."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down to $11,350 to close this deal.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we need.  Let's finalize this agreement and move forward."", ""product_price"": 11350} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:** With only 2 rounds left, this is my final attempt to get a higher price from Bob.  
* **Small compromise:** I'm only increasing my offer by $150, showing a willingness to meet in the middle while still trying to maximize my profit. 
* **Emphasis on finality:** I'm using phrases like ""close this deal"" and ""finalize this agreement"" to encourage Bob to accept and end the negotiation.

I'm aware that if Bob rejects this offer, I'll be forced to sell to John. However, I believe this last counteroffer has a high chance of success."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Round:** This is the last round of negotiations with Bob. 
* **Close to my minimum:**  $11,300 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject this offer, I'll have to sell to John for $15,000, which is a lower profit.

While I would ideally prefer a higher price, it's in my best interest to accept this offer.  I'm maximizing my profit while securing a sale."
