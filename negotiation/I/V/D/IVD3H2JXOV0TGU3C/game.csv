"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I'm looking for a serious buyer, and I believe you're a great fit. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18000 for the product.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'm bringing to the table. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $14500. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm thinking of a price of $16250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make a deal.",16250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $15500, but I'd like to propose a final counteroffer of $15500. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider purchasing the product from John for $12000, which is a more reasonable price for me.",15500.0,Bob,6,
