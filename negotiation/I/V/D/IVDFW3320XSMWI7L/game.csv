"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  However, the value of this product is far greater than your initial offer reflects. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the potential this product holds.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I still think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to propose $1,050,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
