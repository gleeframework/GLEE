"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $125 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can make this work!",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $140? It's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're really trying to get a good deal, and I respect that!  How about we split the difference at $145?  That's fair for both of us, and we can finalize this transaction. What do you say?",145.0,Alice,5,
