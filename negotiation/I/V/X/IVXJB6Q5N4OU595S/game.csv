"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,000,000 represents the high end of its value, I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This feels like a fair compromise, considering the product's unique qualities and potential return on investment.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However,  $875,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a gap here between what we both believe the product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $787,500? This is my final offer.",787500.0,Alice,5,
