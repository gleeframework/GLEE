"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

$200 is way over your budget. It's best to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand it's valuable to you, but $80 is too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $140?

While $140 is closer to your budget, it's still over your desired $80.  You can try to negotiate further, as Alice is showing willingness to compromise."
