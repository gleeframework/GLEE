"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of a price of $12000 for it. Would you like to make an offer or accept?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds great, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 might be a bit out of your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $10500?  I'm really interested in your product and believe this price is fair for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10500. I'm thinking of a price of $11500 for the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for it.",11500.0,Alice,5,
