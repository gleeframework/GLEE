"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of a price of $12000 for it. Would you like to make an offer or accept? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay a maximum of $10,000, and Alice's offer is $2,000 over that.
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.**  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** While buying from John guarantees the product for $10,000, you might be able to get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product sounds great, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** Starting with a lower price than your maximum ($10,000) allows for room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Reasoning Provided:**  Giving Alice a reason for the counteroffer (it's too high) makes the negotiation more polite and less confrontational. 
* **Open to Compromise:** The message ends with a positive note suggesting a willingness to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12000 might be a bit out of your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she's lowered the price, it's still above your maximum of $10,000.
* **Further negotiation is likely.** Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, which suggests that further negotiation could lead to a price you're comfortable with.
* **John remains a backup:** You can always buy from John for $10,000, so there's no immediate need to accept an offer that's above your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  I'm really interested in your product and believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  The counteroffer proposes a price halfway between your previous offer ($9,000) and Alice's offer ($11,000). This signals a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes your interest in the product and frames the offer as fair for both sides.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:**  While $10,500 is closer to your maximum, it still leaves room for Alice to potentially counter with a lower offer, if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10500. I'm thinking of a price of $11500 for the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting worse.**  Instead of moving closer to your desired price, Alice has actually increased her price. 
* **Limited Rounds:** You only have a few rounds left, and the negotiations are not going in your favor. 
* **Guaranteed Price:** Buying from John guarantees the product at your maximum price point ($10,000). Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks running out of time and having to pay a higher price or even not getting the product at all.

It's better to secure the product at a known price than risk further negotiation that could lead to a worse outcome."
