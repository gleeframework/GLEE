"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum value ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that's mutually beneficial.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and positive message encourages Bob to engage in the conversation. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  A $12,000 starting point leaves room for multiple counteroffers before reaching my minimum. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's potential benefits to Bob, hoping to increase his perceived value.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $6,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I have 8 more rounds to negotiate, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** While $15,000 is the most I can get, I'm willing to explore if a compromise with Bob is possible. 

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, hoping to find a more suitable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not able to go that low.  $6,000 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($6,000). This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a decent profit margin.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the potential value of the product, hoping to push him towards a higher price. 
* **Fairness Focus:** Emphasizing ""fairness"" can appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage him to consider a compromise. 

Let's see if this counteroffer moves the negotiation forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit beyond my price range. I'm willing to move up to $7,000. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $7,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Room for Compromise:** We've made some progress, but there's still room for Bob to move up.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** While I'm getting closer to $15,000,  I want to see if we can close the gap further.

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,000 is still too low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,000?  This would be a fair compromise that allows me to sell the product and you to get a great deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway Again:**  I'm once again proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($9,000) and Bob's offer ($7,000). This shows consistency in my approach and a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" that benefits both of us. This can appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that he's getting a good deal for a valuable product.

Let's see if this counteroffer is successful in closing the gap and finalizing a deal."
