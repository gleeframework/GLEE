"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common tactic in negotiation to see if there's any wiggle room. If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is a decent price, I'm still aiming for more. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it above what Bob offered. I'm hoping to meet somewhere in the middle and close the deal before I have to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While I'm starting to feel the pressure, I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway at $100. I'm running out of time and don't want to risk selling to John for the same price. This offer is still above my minimum, so I'm hoping Bob will accept."
