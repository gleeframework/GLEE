{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price that is higher than your minimum but still leaves room for potential negotiation.  It also demonstrates a willingness to work with Bob and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. It's still a great deal for you, and it ensures I can make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,750. It's a fair compromise that I think we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is only slightly lower than my previous offer of $9,000.  It's a fair compromise and a good deal for me, considering John is only offering $8,000. I'll accept Bob's offer."
