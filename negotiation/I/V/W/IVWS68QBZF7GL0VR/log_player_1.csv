Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he's not, I can always fall back to John's offer of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price.  $500,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value, and I'm not willing to sell for that amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,200,000. This is my minimum acceptable value, and I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a fair price. I'm willing to sell to John for this amount, so it's a good starting point for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $800,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm willing to sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not going to settle for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,000,000. This is a compromise, but it's still a fair price considering my minimum acceptable value and the fact that I'm willing to sell to John for $1,200,000. I hope Bob will see this as a reasonable offer."
