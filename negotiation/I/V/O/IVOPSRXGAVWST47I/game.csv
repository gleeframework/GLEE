"Hi Alice, thanks for presenting your product. While it seems like a good fit, $22,000 is significantly higher than I had in mind. I'm willing to offer $8,000 to start the negotiation.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the price, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Could we consider a price closer to $10,000?  Perhaps $9,500 would be agreeable?",9500.0,Bob,4,
