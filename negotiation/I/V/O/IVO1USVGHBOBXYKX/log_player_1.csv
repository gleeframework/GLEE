It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small increments above Bob's current offer.  
* **Time Value:**  Each round represents time and potential lost opportunity with other buyers.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly higher price from Bob isn't worth the risk of him walking away, leaving us with John's lower offer.

$10,800 is a reasonable profit, and it's time to close the deal."
