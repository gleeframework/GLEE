"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe your offer undervalues the product's unique capabilities and potential ROI for your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price at $1,310,000. I'm willing to pay $1,275,000, as I mentioned earlier. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,275,000 and $1,310,000, which would be $1,292,500. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1292500.0,Bob,6,
