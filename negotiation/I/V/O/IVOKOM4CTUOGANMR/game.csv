"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While that offer is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still a bigger jump than I was hoping for. How about we try $925,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the value and my budget.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap here between our valuations.  I'm willing to come down further, but not to that extent. How about $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise to get the deal done.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's try to close the gap.  Would you consider $975,000? I'm trying to be mindful of both our positions.",975000.0,Bob,6,
