Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for further negotiation. It demonstrates Bob's seriousness in buying the product while also pushing for a price closer to his ideal value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9000? This would be a fair price for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're committed to finding a fair price. Let's split the difference -  $8875. This is a very reasonable compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,875 is very close to Bob's desired price of $8,500. It's worth accepting this offer as further negotiation may not result in a significantly better price and could risk losing the deal entirely. It's a reasonable compromise that allows Bob to save a substantial amount compared to buying from John."
