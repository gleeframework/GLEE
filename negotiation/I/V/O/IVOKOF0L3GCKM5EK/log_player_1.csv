"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. Let's close this deal quickly!"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its worth to me is $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still lower than my target. I believe I can push for a higher price by rejecting the counteroffer and making my own.  I have several rounds left, so I'm not desperate to sell immediately."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable paying $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. This is the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price point, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, and I believe I can squeeze out a better deal with a few more rounds.  There's still a decent gap between my minimum and what Bob is offering, so I'm not yet at a point where selling to John is a better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $875,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to go up to $885,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope you can meet me in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I am still only 4 rounds away from potentially selling to John. If I accept this offer, I'll be missing out on a potentially higher price.  I'm going to try to push a little more and see if I can get Bob to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position, but $885,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's compromise and meet at $895,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we can finalize this deal.  I'm ready to close this today."", ""product_price"": 895000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go above $885,000. I think $895,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $890,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm running out of time and Bob has made it clear this is his final offer.  While I would prefer to push for a higher price, it's better to secure a sale now than risk losing the deal altogether and having to settle for John's lower offer.  $890,000 is still a decent profit and worth accepting at this stage."
