Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $22,000. It's a fantastic deal for a product of this quality and value."",
""product_price"": 22000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage. Starting with a high offer of $22,000 gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer will help you gauge Bob's interest level. If he flat-out rejects it, you haven't lost anything and can move on to John. 
* **Potential Upside:** While unlikely, there's a small chance Bob might accept your initial high offer. Even if he counters, you're in a strong position to negotiate a price significantly higher than $15,000. 
 
**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** Be mindful that Bob might perceive the initial offer as too high and lose interest. You'll need to be prepared to adjust your approach if necessary.
* **Negotiation Skills:**  Your ability to read Bob's reactions and negotiate effectively will determine the final outcome."
