Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800000. What do you think?,1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is more than I'm comfortable with.  Considering my value for the product, I'm willing to offer $850000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $975000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975000 is still too high for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer $912500?  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",912500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $912500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $950000. This is still a good deal for me, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $912500.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's finalize this deal.",912500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $912500, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept it. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $925000. This is still a good deal for me, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $925000 is still slightly outside my budget.  I'm going to propose $900000 as a final offer.  It's a significant step closer to your last offer and would allow us to finalize this deal quickly.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,8,
