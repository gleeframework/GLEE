"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is too high.  Since the product is worth $800,000 to you, you should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is more than I'm comfortable with.  Considering my value for the product, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $975000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's counteroffer is lower, it's still above your target price of $800,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate for a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still too high for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer $912,500?  This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 912500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $912500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $950000. This is still a good deal for me, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down in price, it's still too high. You have multiple rounds left to negotiate and can likely get closer to your target price. It's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $912,500.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $912500, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept it. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $925000. This is still a good deal for me, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice has made another concession, the price is still above your target. It's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price, as you have a few more rounds to try and reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $925,000 is still slightly outside my budget.  I'm going to propose $900,000 as a final offer.  It's a significant step closer to your last offer and would allow us to finalize this deal quickly.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $900000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $915000. This is still a good deal for me, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  Alice has come down a bit, but we are still at $915,000. It is unlikely she'll accept your next counteroffer, and you are within $115,000 of your target price with John. It's more advantageous to buy from John to save time and secure a better price within your budget."
