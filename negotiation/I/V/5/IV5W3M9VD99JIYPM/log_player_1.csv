"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I would like to propose a lower price of $130 for the product. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I am willing to pay $132 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value.

```

At this point, Bob is getting very close to Alice's minimum price. It's unlikely he'll go much higher, and further haggling risks losing the sale altogether.  It's better to accept the $132 and secure a profit."
