"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a better price than John's $120, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to work with me.  However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be open to $85?  That would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $92? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still lower than John's price:**  $92 is a better deal than $120. 
* **There's not much room for further negotiation:**  Bob has already offered $85, and Alice has met halfway with $92. Pushing for a lower price may lead to Alice rejecting and Bob ending up with John's higher price. 

It's a good compromise and a reasonable price considering Bob's maximum budget."
