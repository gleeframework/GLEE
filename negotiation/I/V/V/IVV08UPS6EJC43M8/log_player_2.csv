Alice's offer is far too high. It makes more sense to counteroffer or buy from John."

This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get the price as close to my limit as possible without risking losing the deal."

This offer is a compromise, closer to my limit but still lower than Alice's offer. I'm hoping she will accept it, but if not, I can still purchase from John."

While $1,000,000 is getting closer to my limit, I'm still willing to negotiate further. I believe there's room for Alice to lower the price."

This is a final attempt to reach a compromise before purchasing from John. This offer is just slightly above my limit, but I believe it's a fair price considering the previous negotiations."
