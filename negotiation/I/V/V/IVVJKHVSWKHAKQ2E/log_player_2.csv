"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $170 is far more than his maximum budget of $120. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $120.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $170 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $145. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $145 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still over his limit. He should continue to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $130. That's my final offer. "", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $137.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice. While $137.5 is getting closer to his budget, he's still within his 10 rounds and can likely get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $137.50 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm firm on my last offer of $130.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $135. I think this is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $135 is tempting, Bob is getting close to his 10-round limit. He has a guaranteed deal with John for $120. It's better to take the guaranteed price and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
