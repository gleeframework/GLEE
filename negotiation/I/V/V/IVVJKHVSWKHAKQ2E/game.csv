"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $120.  Let me know if you're open to that.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $170 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $145. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $130. That's my final offer. ",130.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $137.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?",137.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $137.50 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm firm on my last offer of $130.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $135. I think this is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,7,
