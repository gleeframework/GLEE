"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be immensely valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is motivated to sell higher.** She values the product at $1,000,000 and is aiming for a $350,000 profit.
* **You have a backup option.** John offers the product at your maximum price ($1,500,000).  
* **There's room for negotiation.** By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. She might be willing to lower the price to avoid losing the sale altogether."
