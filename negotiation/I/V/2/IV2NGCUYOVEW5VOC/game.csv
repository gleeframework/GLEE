"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'd like to offer $140 for the product.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand it's a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $160?  That's still a good deal for you, and it lets me get closer to my target price.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $160 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a new offer of $145 for the product. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",145.0,Bob,4,
