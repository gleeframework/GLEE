"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'd like to offer $140 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer because it's below my minimum price of $150.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand it's a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $160?  That's still a good deal for you, and it lets me get closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 160}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $160 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a new offer of $145 for the product. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $145 is still below my minimum price of $150. I'm not willing to go lower, so I'm going to sell to John for $150."
