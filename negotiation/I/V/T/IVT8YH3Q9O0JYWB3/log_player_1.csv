{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This is a good starting point. It's a reasonable price that's higher than what Bob thinks it's worth, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It also shows a willingness to be flexible and make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $150. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $90 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit further, how about $105?  That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit more."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again - how about $100? This is a great deal for a product of this quality, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. "", ""product_price"": 100}

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still not enough. I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk him walking away completely.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $150 to guarantee I get my minimum price."
