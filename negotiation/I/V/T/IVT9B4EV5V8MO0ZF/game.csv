"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go below $825,000.  This product is truly exceptional, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I'm still not quite comfortable with that price.  How about we split the difference and go with $800,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
