"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Since you're capped at $150 and Alice's offer is exactly that, there's no benefit to negotiating. John offers the same price, so it's a wash."
