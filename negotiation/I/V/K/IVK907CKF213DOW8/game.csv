"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $10000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can meet in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10500. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit while also being reasonable considering the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10000.

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to pay $11400. I've reached my limit, and I think it's time to walk away. I'm willing to pay $10500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $10000.",10500.0,Bob,10,
