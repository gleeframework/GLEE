"Alice,  $2000000 is far beyond my budget.  While I'm very interested in your product, I'm only willing to pay $1000000 at this time.  This is a fair price given my maximum budget and I believe it's a good starting point for our negotiation. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1750000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives you a substantial opportunity for profit. Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1750000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to offer a final price of $1250000.  This is a fair price given the product's value and is the maximum I can afford to pay.  I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
