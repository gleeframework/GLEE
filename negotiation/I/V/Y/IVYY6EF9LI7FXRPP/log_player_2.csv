Bob should accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Saving Money:**  Alice's offer of $9,500 is lower than John's price of $10,000. 
* **No Risk:**  There's no guarantee that John will still be offering the product for $10,000 if Bob rejects Alice's offer.

Bob gets a good deal while ensuring he gets the product he wants."
