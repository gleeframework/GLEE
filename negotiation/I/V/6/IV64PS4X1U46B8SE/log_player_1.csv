"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave some room for negotiation and potentially get a better price than $120 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $80 is a good starting point, I'm still looking for a bit more to make this deal work for me. How about $95? That's a fair compromise, and it would be worth your while to get this product at that price."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $90? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $90 is still a bit below my desired price, it's getting closer to my minimum of $120. I've already had three rounds of negotiation, and there are only seven rounds left. If I keep rejecting Bob's offers, I risk losing him as a buyer and having to sell to John for $120. Accepting Bob's offer at $90 is a better outcome for me at this point."
