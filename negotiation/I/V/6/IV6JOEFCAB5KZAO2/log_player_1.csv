"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $16,000. This is above what the product is worth to Bob, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm confident that I can get a good price, but I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. I have 8 rounds left to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,500. This is still above what the product is worth to Bob, but it's a significant step down from my initial offer. I'm hoping that this demonstrates my willingness to compromise, while still staying within my price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,000 is tempting, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I believe I can still push for a higher price, and I'm not in a rush to sell to John just yet. With several rounds remaining, I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14250}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,250.  This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, signaling that I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. This offer could potentially be a sweet spot, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $15,000.  We're down to the last four rounds, and Bob hasn't budged much from his initial counteroffer. I'm concerned that I'm going to lose too much time trying to squeeze out an extra $250 from Bob, especially with the risk that he'll reject my next offer. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price, and I can move on to other opportunities."
