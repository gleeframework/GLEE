# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.** You'd pay $9,500 from Alice, which is less than the $10,000 you'd pay from John.
* **You are willing to pay up to $10,000.**  Alice's offer is within your budget."
