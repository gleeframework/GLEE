"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000.
* Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is higher than your maximum price.
* It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. There's a chance she might accept a lower counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,250,000, which is still below my maximum price of $1,200,000 but leaves some room for negotiation. 
* This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price of $1,400,000, indicating my seriousness in negotiating.
* I'm hoping to find a middle ground where Alice can still get a good price, but I can also save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above my maximum price of $1,200,000.
* I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation to try and get a better price. 
* I believe there's still room for compromise, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* My previous counteroffer of $1,250,000 was rejected, so I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,300,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and willing to compromise.
*  $1,300,000 is still below Alice's latest offer of $1,350,000 and closer to my maximum price of $1,200,000.
* I believe this offer is a fair compromise that could potentially lead to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,320,000 is still above my maximum price of $1,200,000. 
* Although we've made some progress in the negotiation, it's unlikely that Alice will go significantly lower, as she's already dropped her price by $180,000. 
* Further negotiation might be time-consuming and potentially fruitless.
* At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $1,200,000, securing the product at my maximum price and avoiding further negotiation."
