Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $119. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $120 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to feel like he got a slight deal if he's prone to negotiation, but still secures almost the maximum profit for Alice. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $100 ensures Alice won't go below that price, giving her a strong bargaining position."
