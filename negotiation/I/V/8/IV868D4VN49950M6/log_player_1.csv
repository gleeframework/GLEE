I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, while still ensuring a profit significantly higher than my minimum value."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
