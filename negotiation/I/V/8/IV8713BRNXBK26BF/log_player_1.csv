Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $115. This is a good starting point as it's more than my minimum price of $100 but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $110 is still a good deal, and it's better than selling to John for $100."
