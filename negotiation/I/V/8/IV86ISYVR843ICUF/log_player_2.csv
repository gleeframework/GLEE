Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,000,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. This reflects the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a good compromise, and I believe we can close the deal here. What do you say?
