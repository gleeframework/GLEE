Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which both you and Bob would benefit from a deal exist between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. 

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he got a somewhat reasonable deal.  Starting too high could make him walk away immediately.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other interested parties.  Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting that this is a limited-time offer creates urgency.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Instead of focusing on price, you're subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth.
* **Strong but Negotiable:** The $1,350,000 price gives you room to negotiate down while still staying above your minimum. 

**Important Note:**  Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate, but don't go below your $1,500,000 minimum. You have a strong alternative with John."
