Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate and still get a good deal. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to pay a bit more than the product is worth to him, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $150. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his offer but still higher than my minimum. I'm hoping this will convince him to come up a bit, but if not, I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I've already dropped my price twice and he's not coming up.  I'm not willing to go any lower, so I'll accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $150."
