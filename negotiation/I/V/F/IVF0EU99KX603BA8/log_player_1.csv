Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for me.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently decreasing his offer, but he's still significantly above our fallback option of $1,200,000 with John. We need to push back firmly now to signal we have a strong alternative and won't go much lower."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts in this negotiation, but I need you to understand the value of this product. I have other options available, and $1,260,000 is simply too far below my threshold.  I'm willing to consider $1,290,000, but that's my final offer."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you have other options, but I'm still interested in this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,240,000, which is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,240,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,240,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While we stated a higher ""final offer"" in the previous round, Bob is now getting too close to our fallback option of $1,200,000. Accepting his offer of $1,240,000 secures a reasonable profit and avoids the risk of him walking away completely. It's better to take a slightly smaller profit now than risk losing the sale altogether in the next two rounds."
