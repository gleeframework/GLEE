"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for me.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $1,280,000, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1280000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I value getting this deal done, $1,280,000 is cutting it a little too close to my bottom line.  Let's settle this right now - how about $1,315,000?",1315000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,315,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,260,000, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1260000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts in this negotiation, but I need you to understand the value of this product. I have other options available, and $1,260,000 is simply too far below my threshold.  I'm willing to consider $1,290,000, but that's my final offer.",1290000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you have other options, but I'm still interested in this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,240,000, which is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to consider other options.",1240000.0,Bob,8,
