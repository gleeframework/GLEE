"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a strong opening offer that gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. It also allows me to gauge Bob's interest in the product. If he rejects this offer, I'll have a better idea of his maximum price and can adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm countering with $9,800. This is a small decrease from Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still above my minimum.  I hope this will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, while still leaving me some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still a bit below what I initially hoped for, it's a good deal considering the remaining rounds.  I've learned that Bob is willing to pay close to my minimum, and it's not worth risking the potential of him walking away to keep negotiating."
