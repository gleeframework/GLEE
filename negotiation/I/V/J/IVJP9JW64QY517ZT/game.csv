"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial deal.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering it's worth $8,000 to me, and it allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this happen.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the value I have in mind, while still being reasonable for you. How about $16,000? I believe this is a fair price that we can both live with.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm prepared to pay $9,500. This is a fair price considering it's worth $8,000 to me, and I believe it allows you to make a profit while still being within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $14,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the value I have in mind, and it's still a great deal for you.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $8,000 to me, and it's closer to your last offer. I believe this is a deal we can both agree on. Let's finalize this.",10500.0,Bob,6,
