"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. I believe this price reflects the fair market value and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account the value you see in the product, while also allowing me to get a good deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I can offer you a price of $1,025,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
