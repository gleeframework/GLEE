Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I'll see how Bob reacts to this offer and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It still leaves some room for negotiation, but it shows that I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge from his $120 offer, and I've already made a compromise. While I could keep going back and forth, I'm not confident I'll be able to get a better price from him.  It's best to take the guaranteed $120 from John and move on."
