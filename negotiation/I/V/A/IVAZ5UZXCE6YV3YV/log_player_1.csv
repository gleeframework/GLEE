Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,200,000 is higher than $800,000, but still gives Bob some room to negotiate. 
* **It's significantly less than your minimum:** You're aiming for much more than $1,200,000, so you have room to counter if needed.
* **It's a strong opening:**  A clear price point shows you're serious and willing to negotiate, without being overly aggressive.

**Important Note:**  Be prepared to counter Bob if he rejects this offer. It's likely he'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's not even close to my minimum of $1,500,000. I need to counter with a more reasonable price, or move on to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still reflects the value of the product for you.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. "", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show you're willing to negotiate:**  Coming down from $1,200,000 shows you're flexible, but not desperate. 
* **Stay above your minimum:**  $900,000 is still far above your minimum of $1,500,000, giving you room for further negotiations.
* **Give Bob a fair offer:**  $900,000 is closer to Bob's perceived value, making a deal more likely.

Keep in mind:  If Bob rejects this offer, you have the option to sell to John or to counter again. Be ready to adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is still significantly below my minimum, and his counteroffers are getting increasingly closer to my minimum. This suggests that he is unlikely to meet my price expectations. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
