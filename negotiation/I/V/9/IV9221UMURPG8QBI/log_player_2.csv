{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $100. This is a bold move, but since Alice's initial offer was so high, it's worth trying to see if she's willing to come down significantly."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, $125 is still above my preferred budget. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $110, which is a compromise between my maximum budget and Alice's last offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also firm about my limits."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, it's still above my comfortable range. At this point, the negotiation is taking too long, and I'm confident that John will sell me the product for my target price of $100. It's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing."
