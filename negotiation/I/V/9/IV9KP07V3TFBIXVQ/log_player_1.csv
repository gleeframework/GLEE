"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down while still potentially securing a great deal.
* **Close to Bob's Value:**  Knowing the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation but aims for a price close to his perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly states this is a ""starting point,"" signaling to Bob that you are open to discussion and potential adjustments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good offer, it's still significantly below Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000.  There's room for negotiation. We are aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your offer."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between our previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000). It shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a strong price.
* **Justification:**  The message reinforces the product's value and acknowledges Bob's offer, aiming to make the counteroffer feel more reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,050,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $980,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $980,000 is still a significant margin from Bob's $1,200,000 valuation. With 6 rounds remaining, there's room for smaller concessions to try and reach a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we land at $1,020,000? I'm demonstrating my commitment to finding a solution, and I believe this price represents a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1020000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We are reducing our offer by $30,000 from $1,050,000, showing movement but in smaller increments as we get closer to a potential agreement.
* **Emphasis on Fairness and Solution:** The language aims to create a collaborative tone, highlighting the benefits to both parties of reaching a deal at this price. 
* **Time Consideration:** While we have rounds remaining, it's strategic to try and reach an agreement sooner rather than later to avoid prolonged negotiations and potential for Bob to lose interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,020,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $990,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:**  $990,000 is a very good offer. It's significantly above our minimum of $800,000 and a profitable outcome.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate aggressively might only yield small incremental gains and risks alienating Bob.  He might become less willing to compromise, especially as he knows we have the $800,000 offer from John.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now allows us to reinvest the earnings sooner rather than later.  Prolonging negotiations might not be worth the potential for slightly more profit."
