"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to the value I'm hoping for. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $8,000, which would be $9,000. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
