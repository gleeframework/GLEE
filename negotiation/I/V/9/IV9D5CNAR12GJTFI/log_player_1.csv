Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,400,000 is higher than Bob's valuation of $1,200,000, giving him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $1,400,000 is still above your minimum of $1,500,000, leaving room for potential profit.

This strategy aims to start the negotiation in a way that:

* **Maximizes your potential earnings:** You're starting high, leaving space to negotiate down.
* **Keeps the deal open:** By offering a price Bob might consider, you avoid him immediately rejecting the offer. 
* **Sets a clear expectation:**  You've established a price point that you're willing to start at.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response, and you have the option to walk away and sell to John if negotiations become too difficult."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss.  

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer in the next round. I need to find a price that is closer to my desired value while still being attractive enough for Bob to consider."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is too far below what I need for this product.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I've proposed $1,250,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $1,400,000 and Bob's offer of $1,000,000. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob that even at $1,250,000, he's getting a good deal, as the product is worth $1,200,000 to him.
* **Reiterating my need:** I've clearly stated that $1,000,000 is simply not acceptable to me. 

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Push for a better deal:**  While I'm coming down, I'm still above Bob's initial offer.
* **Show willingness to negotiate:** This demonstrates that I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Maintain leverage:** By setting a firm price point, I'm avoiding a situation where I might get pressured into accepting a very low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about $1,150,000? I think that's a fair price that gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Accepting would still result in a loss for me.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer in the next round.  I will try to find a price that is closer to my minimum while still being within Bob's budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $1,150,000 is closer, but still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final offer:** This counteroffer clearly states that it's my final offer. This adds pressure to Bob and encourages him to accept.
* **Slightly below minimum:**  $1,200,000 is still slightly below my minimum, but it's a good compromise considering Bob's consistent lower offers.
* **Emphasis on alternatives:** I remind Bob that if he doesn't accept, I'm willing to sell to John, implying that I'm not desperate for his deal.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Close the deal:** This offer should be attractive enough for Bob to accept, as it's within his budget and a good deal for him.
* **Limit further negotiations:**  By making it my final offer, I reduce the chance of endless back and forth.
* **Maintain control:**  Even though I'm offering a lower price, I'm still setting the terms and the deadline."
