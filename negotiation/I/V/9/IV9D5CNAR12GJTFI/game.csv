"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is too far below what I need for this product.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $1,150,000 is closer, but still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
