"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it's worth more to you. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $10,500.  Let's split the difference. How about $10,000? This is a fair price considering both our positions, and it allows us to close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
