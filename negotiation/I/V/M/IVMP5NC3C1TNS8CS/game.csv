"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,800 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,200. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to get closer to my goal while still giving you a good deal. Let's finalize this!",11200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $11,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
