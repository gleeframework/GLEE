"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This price is still within your profit margin, and it's the highest I can offer at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  However, the value this product brings, especially to someone like you, is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.  What do you think?",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,375,000 is still outside my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,300,000.  This price allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but I need to be fair to the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,337,500? This allows us both to compromise and reach a mutually beneficial outcome.  This is my final offer.",1337500.0,Alice,5,
