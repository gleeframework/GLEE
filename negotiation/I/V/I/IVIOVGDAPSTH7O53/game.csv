"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $600,000 is a tempting offer, I know the true value of this product is significantly higher. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $725,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the value you've placed on the product.",725000.0,Bob,4,
