Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given its value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal, I'm confident I can get a higher price. I still have several rounds to negotiate with Bob and want to maximize my profit."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a specific price, but I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This represents a significant compromise on both our ends and could potentially lead to a deal. What do you think?

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to what I want, I'm still aiming for a higher price. With only 6 rounds left, I need to be strategic. I'm hoping to push for a better deal with Bob, but if I don't see progress, selling to John might be my best option."
