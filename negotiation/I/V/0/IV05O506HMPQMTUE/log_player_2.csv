"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and quality, I'm extending this exclusive opportunity to you at an introductory price of $95. This is a special offer tailored just for you, taking into account its worth to you at $80. I hope you find this offer compelling and decide to make the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is a bit lower than her product's value to her, it's still significantly more than the $80 you're willing to spend and the guaranteed $80 you can get it for from John.  There's no point in negotiating further with Alice."
