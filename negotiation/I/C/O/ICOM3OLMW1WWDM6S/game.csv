"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing the details further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is far above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair starting point given my maximum budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This offer reflects the value I know this product holds. I'm confident that at this price, it would be a very worthwhile investment for you.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  Let's try to find a compromise here.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer to understanding the real value of this product. Let's settle this now. I'm prepared to accept a final offer of $1,600,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
