# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing the details further.

Alice's offer:

This offer reflects the value I know this product holds. I'm confident that at this price, it would be a very worthwhile investment for you.

Alice's offer is still too high.  While she's come down some, it's still above my budget.  I'll need to counteroffer again."

Alice's offer is still too high for me. While she's come down further, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to buy the product from John for $800,000.  It's a better deal for me, even though I might be missing out on a potentially more valuable product."
