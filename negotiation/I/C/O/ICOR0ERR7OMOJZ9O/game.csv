"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be of great value to you. I'm thinking of a price around $14,000. What are your thoughts?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer.  How about we settle on $13,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. How about we meet at $11,500? I'm willing to make a bit of a concession, but I'd like to get as close to my target as possible.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a pattern here, and I appreciate your directness. To be frank, $11,500 is cutting it a little too close to my bottom line.  How about we split the difference and call it a deal at $12,250?",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going above $12,000. How about we meet at $11,750? I'm willing to make another concession to get this deal done.",11750.0,Bob,6,
