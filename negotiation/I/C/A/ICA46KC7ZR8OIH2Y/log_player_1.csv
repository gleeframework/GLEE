Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). However, it leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down while still netting you a profit above your guaranteed price.
* **Scarcity Tactic:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. You might adjust your price slightly based on your understanding of Bob's negotiating style or your risk tolerance."
