"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's necessary to establish a strong starting point. I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to negotiate. 

If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds. 

However, I'm keeping the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 open, as that's my guaranteed minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy with the $1,500,000 offer from Bob, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can secure a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate. It's also a significant increase from Bob's offer, giving him room to meet me in the middle. 

I'm still keeping my options open, but I'm feeling optimistic about closing this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is too low. While I'm feeling the pressure with time running out, I'm not willing to settle for such a significant loss.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range in the next round.  I'm still confident that we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this shows him I'm serious about negotiating, but also willing to be flexible. 

With each round, I'm getting closer to John's offer, so I need to find a solution that's more favorable than that to keep this deal alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable, and I'm running out of time.  It's clear that we're too far apart in our valuations. While I'd prefer to close a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to risk losing significant profit. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and allows me to move on."
