"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it's still a bit lower than what I need to move forward. I'm willing to come down to $1175000. This is a significant compromise, and it demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for us both.  I'm hoping you'll see this as a fair price that reflects the value you place on the product.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
