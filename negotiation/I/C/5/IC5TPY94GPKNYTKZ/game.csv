"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $110 is a bit steep for me.  How about $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $115. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $110, but that's my final offer. If we can't agree on that, I'll need to consider other options.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $112.50? It's still a great price for the product, and I think we can both be happy with it.",112.5,Alice,5,
