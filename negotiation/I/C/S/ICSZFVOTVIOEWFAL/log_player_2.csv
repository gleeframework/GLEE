"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good deal, it's still above his maximum budget.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,050,000 is your maximum budget for the product, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more than that. My counteroffer is $1,075,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm open to further discussion.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I can justify. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My next offer is $1,090,000. I believe this is a reasonable price, considering the value the product brings to you. I'm open to further discussion, but I need to be closer to my target. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible deal. While Alice's offer of $1,090,000 is closer to his budget, he's not willing to accept it yet. He can still try to negotiate a lower price, as he has a few more rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1,090,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,060,000.  This price represents a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1060000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,060,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. My next offer is $1,080,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a few more rounds to negotiate, but Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is still above his target price. With limited rounds remaining, the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice is too high. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to accept John's offer of $1,000,000, ensuring he gets the product within his budget."
