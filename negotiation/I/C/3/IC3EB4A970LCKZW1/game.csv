"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $8,200 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would you consider that?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go above $8,000. However, I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $8,100. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",8100.0,Alice,5,
