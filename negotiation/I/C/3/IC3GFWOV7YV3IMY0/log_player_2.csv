"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You can do better than $120, so it's worth continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand $120 was a bit high, but $100 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? This would still give you a great deal on a product that's worth much more to you.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

$110 is a good deal for Bob, saving him $40 compared to buying from John. It's worth accepting the offer to get the product at a good price."
