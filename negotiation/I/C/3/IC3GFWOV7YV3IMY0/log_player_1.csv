Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's more than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Fair Offer:**  $120 is a good middle ground, giving Bob a decent discount while still allowing me to make a profit significantly higher than my minimum. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message makes it clear I'm open to discussing the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While $100 is better than my minimum ($80), it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. The fact that he's interested suggests he's willing to pay more than $100.
* **Negotiation:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand $120 was a bit high, but $100 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? This would still give you a great deal on a product that's worth much more to you. "", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm proposing a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a fair price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to encourage him to consider a slightly higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message leaves the door open for further discussion if Bob still finds $110 too high."
