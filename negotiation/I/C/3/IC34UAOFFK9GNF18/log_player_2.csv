"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love.  I'm asking for $115 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is close to Bob's maximum, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  He's already indicated he's willing to pay up to $100, so this is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. 
* **Compromise:** $105 is a halfway point between Alice's offer of $115 and Bob's maximum of $100. It shows Bob is serious about buying but also wants to save some money.
* **Positive tone:**  The message is polite and shows that Bob is interested in the product, even if not at the initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While $110 is closer to Bob's maximum, it's still above what he's willing to pay without feeling like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Time pressure:**  With only 7 rounds left, it's important to keep negotiating.  Alice is showing willingness to compromise, and Bob can likely get a better price with a few more rounds.
* **John as leverage:**  The fact that Bob can buy from John for $100 gives him leverage throughout the negotiation. This allows him to be more confident in holding out for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still hoping for a slightly better price.  How about $107.50?  That's closer to what I'm comfortable with."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Offer:** Bob is making a smaller counter-offer, showing that he's serious about making a deal but still wants to save money.  A $2.50 difference is more likely to be acceptable to Alice than the previous $5.00.
* **Compromise:**  $107.50 is closer to Bob's maximum, but still leaves some room for Alice to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a friendly and cooperative tone helps keep the negotiation positive, even with a smaller difference."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I value your interest in the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping for a bit more, let's meet in the middle at $109.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the limit:**  $109 is very close to Bob's maximum of $100. However, with only 5 rounds left, there's still room to try and get a better deal.  
* **Negotiation strategy:**  By continuing to reject Alice's offers, Bob can signal that he's serious about getting a lower price.  This could potentially lead to Alice making a more significant compromise in the next few rounds.
* **Leverage:**  Remember, John is still an option, and that gives Bob a powerful bargaining chip. It allows him to be less pressured to accept a price he's not completely satisfied with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. Let's aim for a final compromise. I'm willing to go up to $108.  How about we settle on that?"", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  This counter-offer shows a clear intention to close the deal, indicating that Bob is getting close to his limit. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** $108 is right in the middle of Alice's last offer of $109 and Bob's desired price of $107.50.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message emphasizes Bob's appreciation for Alice's negotiation efforts, maintaining a positive tone for a potential final deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and  I'm willing to come down to $108.50 as a final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** Alice's offer of $108.50 is only $0.50 more than Bob's counteroffer of $108. This is a very small difference, and likely represents a final compromise.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 3 rounds remaining, continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal.  It's unlikely Alice will drop her price further.
* **Value vs. Savings:** While Bob can buy from John for $100, the product is worth $100 to him, and the extra $8.50 to buy from Alice is a small price to pay for a product he values.
* **Future Deals:**  It's possible that accepting this offer could build goodwill with Alice, potentially leading to better deals in future negotiations."
