"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value it offers.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Considering my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his budget.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to push for a price closer to his desired $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a final price of $1,325,000.  This reflects a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but even after several rounds, Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, as it guarantees a price within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
