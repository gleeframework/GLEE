"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to begin negotiations with a figure above your desired outcome. This leaves room for concessions and creates the perception of value.
* **Anchoring:** By setting a high initial price, we aim to ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. This can influence his counteroffers to be more favorable to us.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The  $2,000,000 offer provides ample space to negotiate downwards throughout the 10 rounds while still aiming for a price above our minimum.

It's important to remember that this is just the opening move. We'll need to adjust our strategy based on Bob's response and the progress of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering its value.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is above his own perceived value, it's still significantly below our minimum of $1,500,000. We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and selling to John is a strong fallback option. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about a higher price and encourage Bob to improve his proposal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is too low for me to consider at this point.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to $1,800,000 is more reflective of that.  I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us, so let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're lowering our asking price from $2,000,000 to $1,800,000. This shows Bob we're willing to negotiate but also keeps us comfortably above our minimum target.
* **Justifying the Price:** We're reiterating the value proposition of the product, subtly anchoring it to the higher price point.
* **Encouraging Dialogue:**  By ending with ""let me know your thoughts"", we invite Bob to continue the negotiation and make a counterproposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,800,000 is still above my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering both our positions. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches our minimum acceptable price. While we could try to negotiate for more in subsequent rounds, there's no guarantee Bob would be willing to go higher. Accepting this offer secures a favorable outcome and avoids the risk of him walking away or the negotiation reaching an impasse."
