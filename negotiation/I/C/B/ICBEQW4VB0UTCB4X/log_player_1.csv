{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, giving us significant room to negotiate above our minimum price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While we start high, the $925,000 offer leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer. This makes him feel more in control of the process.
* **High Anchor:** By starting with a high number, we set a strong anchor in Bob's mind, potentially making him more receptive to a price point that's still very favorable to us but might seem like a ""deal"" compared to the initial offer.
* **Alternative Option (John):** We have a safety net with John at $800,000. This knowledge empowers us to aim higher with Bob.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Bob's response to this offer will determine our next move. We might need to be flexible and adjust our approach depending on his reaction."
