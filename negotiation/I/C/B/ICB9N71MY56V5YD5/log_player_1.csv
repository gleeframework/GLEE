Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $80 is too low. I can do better than that.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit to $120, given the value of this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $95 just doesn't cover the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's try to close this deal,  I'm confident you'll be happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100. This is my final offer.  I hope you'll consider it.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. Bob's final offer of $100 is still too low for me, and I'm not confident that I can get him to go higher. It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John rather than risk losing more time with Bob."
