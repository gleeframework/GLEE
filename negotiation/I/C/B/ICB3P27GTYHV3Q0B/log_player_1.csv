Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000. I believe this price is fair considering the current market conditions and the product's specifications. Please let me know if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it immediately. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $850,000 to accommodate your budget, but this is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $825,000. This price takes into account both the product's quality and the current market conditions. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $825,000 is still less than my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum.  Since Bob is willing to go higher than $800,000, I'll take this deal to avoid risking a potential stalemate or losing him as a buyer altogether."
