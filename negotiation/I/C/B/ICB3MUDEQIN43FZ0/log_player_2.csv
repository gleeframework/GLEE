Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $600,000 is significantly below what I need to sell.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this valuable product. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a price that's reasonable for both of us. Let's work together to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly motivated to sell, and we're getting closer to my limit.  There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get her down closer to $800,000 before I consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To make this deal happen, I'm willing to offer $800,000. That's my absolute best price. If we can agree on that, we can close this out today."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Pushing the Limit:** I'm now offering my maximum price. This puts the ball firmly in Alice's court and signals that I'm serious about buying but not willing to budge further.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By saying ""close this out today,"" I'm adding a touch of urgency, potentially motivating Alice to accept to avoid further negotiation. 
* **Alternative is Ready:** I'm comfortable walking away at this point and buying from John if Alice rejects this offer."
