"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'd like to propose a price of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential and my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $920,000. I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $920,000 is still beyond my budget. To demonstrate my genuine interest, I'm willing to go up to $880,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to move forward. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",880000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $890,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",890000.0,Bob,6,
