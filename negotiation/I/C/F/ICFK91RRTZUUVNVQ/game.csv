"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'd be happy to make a deal at this price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9000 is a competitive price, but I'm still looking to get a better return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500. This is a fair compromise that should satisfy both of our interests.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $9800, which is the highest I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9800. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $10200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it.",10200.0,Alice,5,
