"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering my maximum budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you coming back with a revised price.  While $1,250,000 is lower than I hoped, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This reflects the value of the product and still allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to me and my budget. Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
