I'm starting with a high price of $1,800,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, and hopefully, he'll recognize the product's value and be willing to pay a significant price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,400,000 is a decent price, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. It's a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, but still a fair amount considering the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is very close to my ideal price. It's a good deal for me, and it's likely that further negotiation will only lead to a lower price. Therefore, it's best to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
