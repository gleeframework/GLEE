Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000.  This is a bold move, but it establishes a high baseline for the negotiation.  I believe the product is worth more than $800,000 to me, and I'm confident I can get a good price. 

I'm also taking into account that Bob might be willing to pay a premium for this product, especially if he doesn't know what the market value is. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a counteroffer of my own, always keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 and the potential alternative sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a good price, I'm not ready to settle yet.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can secure a better price than Bob's current offer.  

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm offering $950,000. This is a compromise that acknowledges Bob's willingness to pay more than $900,000, but still allows me to get closer to my desired price point.  I'm hoping this will be a more appealing proposition for Bob, while also staying above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $920,000. While I was hoping for a slightly higher price, this is a fair offer that is only $30,000 less than my last counteroffer and is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  It's time to close the deal and move on."
