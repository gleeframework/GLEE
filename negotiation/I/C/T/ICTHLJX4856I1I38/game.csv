"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $700,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective.  While $700,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product and its capabilities, I'm willing to move closer to your range. How about we consider $1,000,000? This feels like a fairer reflection of its worth.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to go up to $750,000.  Let's meet in the middle.",750000.0,Bob,4,
