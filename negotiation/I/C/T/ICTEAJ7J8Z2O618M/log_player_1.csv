"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm making it clear that I'm willing to negotiate, but also conveying that I believe the initial price is fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum:** While $10,000 is acceptable, I'm not desperate to sell immediately.
* **Opportunity for Better Price:**  I believe there's potential to get a better price from Bob, especially since he showed interest.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $10,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Maintain My Value:**  By sticking to a price above $10,000, I'm ensuring I still get a decent return on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $11000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and it gets us closer to a final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on Agreement:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price point.
* **Time is Limited:** With only 6 rounds remaining, it's important to consider the risk of losing Bob entirely. 
* **Good Profit Margin:**  $11,000 is a good profit margin, especially compared to selling to John for $10,000. 

While I'd prefer to try for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit. There's a good chance that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or me having to settle for John's offer, so it's strategically sound to accept at this point."
