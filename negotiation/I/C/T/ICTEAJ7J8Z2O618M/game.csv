"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $10000 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $11000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and it gets us closer to a final agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
