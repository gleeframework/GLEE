Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that initial price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $1,100,000 and we have a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,250,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that price is still a little too steep for my budget.  Would you consider $1,150,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and willing to negotiate. We're still significantly above John's offer, so the risk of continuing is relatively low. We'll push a little further and see if we can get closer to $1,200,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value in this product. Let's find a sweet spot: $1,210,000. It's a strong offer reflecting its true worth."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I can do $1,175,000, but I need you to meet me closer to my price.  Do we have a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could likely push for a bit more, Bob's offer of $1,175,000 is a strong one. It represents a significant profit above our $1,000,000 minimum and a substantial gain from John's offer. Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away, so accepting now secures a very favorable outcome."
