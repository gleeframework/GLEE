Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** It's always better to start with a higher price than your minimum.  This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Consider Bob's Valuation:** While you know Bob values the product at $100, he doesn't know your minimum price. There's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives the product as valuable. 
* **Backup Offer:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $100 from John, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob. 

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still giving you the security of a guaranteed sale."
