"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth rejecting the offer and seeing if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a low counteroffer, close to his maximum budget. This shows Alice he's serious about buying but wants a good deal.  It also gives Alice room to negotiate without feeling like she's losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's work towards a fair agreement! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still above his maximum budget. It's worth rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate to see if Alice will come down further. There are still plenty of rounds left, and Bob can always choose to buy from John if the negotiations don't reach a satisfactory price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value and our previous offers. Let's reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is gradually increasing his offer, showing he's willing to negotiate.  $9,000 is a significant compromise, but still leaves some room for Alice to come down a bit. This maintains the negotiation and keeps the pressure on Alice to reach a deal before Bob decides to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  However, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This reflects the value of the product and my desire to reach an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is tempting and getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still a bit higher than he'd like to pay.  With 5 rounds remaining, Bob has room to continue negotiating and try to get Alice to lower the price further. He also has the option to buy from John as a backup if he doesn't get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise. However, $9,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,250, which is a fair middle ground between our previous offers.  Let's close this deal and find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a small increase to his offer, showing he's willing to negotiate further. He is aiming for a compromise close to his budget,  demonstrating his seriousness about reaching an agreement.  He is also highlighting the middle ground to appeal to Alice's sense of fairness. By offering a specific amount, it puts the ball back in Alice's court and creates pressure for a quicker decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,250 is still a bit low for me, but I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $9,400.  This is a fair compromise, and it reflects the true value of the product. It's a deal you won't regret!  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,400 is still a bit above Bob's ideal price, it's getting very close to his maximum budget, and Alice is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. There's a good chance that Alice won't go any lower, and continuing to reject offers might risk losing the deal altogether. With only a few rounds left, it's a calculated risk to accept the offer and secure the product, especially considering the alternative of buying from John for $8,000.  This decision prioritizes a swift and relatively advantageous deal over the potential for a slightly lower price."
