{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product.  I'm asking for $175 for it.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 175}

This offer starts high, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm confident John will buy it for $150 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

$70 is far too low.  It's worth $150 to me, and I'm not going to sell it at a loss. I'm going to counter and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer, it's still below what I consider a fair price. I'm going to counter again to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we split the difference and go with $107.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures you get a great product."", ""product_price"": 107.50}
