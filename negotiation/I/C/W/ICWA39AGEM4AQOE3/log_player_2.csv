"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $12000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $14000.  This is a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a lower price, and I get to sell it to someone who will really appreciate it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
