"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $10000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for a deal.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price between $15000 and $18000, which is still a great value for this unique product. How about we meet in the middle at $16500? It's a fair price that takes into account both our perspectives.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $16500 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me. Let's try to meet in the middle again. I'm willing to offer $13000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $13000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of a price between $15000 and $16500, which is still a great value for this unique product. How about we meet in the middle at $15750?
