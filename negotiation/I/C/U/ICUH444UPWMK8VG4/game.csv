"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000?  That's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. ",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,500 still doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to go down a bit further, how about $9,750? This way we can both get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's my final offer. If we can meet at this price, I'll be happy to make a deal.",9500.0,Bob,6,
