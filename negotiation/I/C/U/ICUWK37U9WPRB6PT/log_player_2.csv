"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a game-changer. Would you like to make an offer for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price.  You can likely get a better deal than $900,000, especially since you don't know the value of the product to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a strong counteroffer:** A significant drop from $900,000 to $700,000 shows you're serious about negotiating.
* **Be polite and express interest:** Maintain a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Leave room for compromise:**  $700,000 is still a good deal for you, allowing for potential back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price that's $50000 higher than your offer. Would you be willing to meet me at $750000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good deal:** Alice's offer of $750,000 is well within your budget and significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000.
* **Compromise:** Alice met you halfway by offering $50,000 more than your counteroffer.
* **Limited upside:**  Further negotiation could potentially yield a lower price, but the risk of losing the deal to John or Alice walking away outweighs the potential gains."
