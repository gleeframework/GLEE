"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? ",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $9,000, which is $8,500. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $9,200.",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,200 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $8,750.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think? ",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,750 yet. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, but I'm thinking you could go a bit higher. How about $9,150?",9150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but I'm still a little above my target.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,900? This would be a great compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with the deal.",8900.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,900. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $9,050?",9050.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, and I'm happy to meet you halfway again.  Let's call it $8,950.  This feels like a good compromise for both of us, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",8950.0,Bob,8,
