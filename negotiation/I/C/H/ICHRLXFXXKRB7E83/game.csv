"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product,  $950,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and a fair price for you.  This price allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $875,000 for the product. This offer is fair and allows both of us to reach an agreement.  Let's finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
