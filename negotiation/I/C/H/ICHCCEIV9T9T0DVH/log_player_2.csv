"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's tailored to meet your specific needs and offers significant value. Considering its worth to you, I propose a price of $10000. This is a special offer considering the high demand and limited availability of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than $12,000, Bob knows the product is worth less than that to Alice.  He has 10 rounds to negotiate and can always buy from John as a fallback.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're offering, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking a calculated risk. He's aiming for a price closer to his maximum but still leaving room for negotiation. The message is friendly and acknowledges Alice's offer, while also establishing Bob's firm starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering our product's value and your willingness to pay, I propose a price of $9500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, but there's still room to negotiate. Bob wants to save as much as possible and can still fall back on John's offer.  He's in a good position to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $9,500. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer $9,250 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again demonstrating his willingness to negotiate while aiming for a price closer to his target.  The offer is a compromise, suggesting he's serious about a deal but not willing to budge much further.  The message emphasizes fairness and a desire to close the deal, putting pressure on Alice to accept."
