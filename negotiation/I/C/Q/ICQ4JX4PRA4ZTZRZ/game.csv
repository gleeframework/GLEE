"I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $15000?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $17000. It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $17000 is a bit high. Would you be willing to drop the price to $16000?",16000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $16000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16000 and $17000, which is $16500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,7,
