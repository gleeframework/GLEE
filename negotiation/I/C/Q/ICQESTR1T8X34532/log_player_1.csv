Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150.  I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with the price I would get from John, as that's my baseline. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm including a message that implies I'm willing to negotiate, making Bob more likely to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  I'm starting with the highest possible price.
* **Encourage negotiation:**  The message invites Bob to counter, which could lead to a price closer to my desired range.
* **Secure the sale:** Even if Bob rejects, I still have John as a backup buyer."
