"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $12000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $17000. This price still reflects the value of the product, but it allows for some flexibility.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $17000. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to try to get closer to my target. How about $14000? I think this is a fair price considering the value you're offering, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done.",14000.0,Bob,4,
