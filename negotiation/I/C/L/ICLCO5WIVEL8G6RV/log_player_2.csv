# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe has significant value, potentially far exceeding $1000000. While I can't disclose specifics at this time, I'm confident this product can be highly beneficial for the right individual. I'm willing to let you purchase it for $1250000, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential. If you're interested, I'm happy to provide further information. However, this offer is only valid for a limited time, as I have another interested buyer ready to purchase it for $1000000.
