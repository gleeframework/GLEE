"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but I'd only be willing to pay something closer to $80 for it.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $125.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm glad we're finding some middle ground. However, $125 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $95? I think that's a fair offer.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $95 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a good price for both of us and allows me to cover my costs. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate your flexibility.  Tell you what, how about we meet in the middle at $105? That's a firm offer from me.",105.0,Bob,6,
