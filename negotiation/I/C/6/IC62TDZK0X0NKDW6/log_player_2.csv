"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
This is a terrible starting offer from Alice. It's far above both your limit and the product's worth to you. Rejecting and providing a counter-offer is the best way to start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but I'd only be willing to pay something closer to $80 for it."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** Starting with a low offer puts the pressure on Alice. It signals that you're serious about getting a good deal and won't easily accept a price close to her initial offer.
* **Anchoring:**  By throwing out $80, you're trying to anchor the negotiation closer to your desired range. Even if Alice doesn't agree to this price, it provides a starting point for further negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This offer leaves you plenty of room to negotiate upwards if needed, while still staying well below your $100 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $125.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While $125 is a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer, it's still above your $100 limit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to ""split the difference"" suggests there's room for further negotiation. You can likely get the price lower.
* **John as Backup:**  You still have the option to buy from John for $100 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't reach a favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm glad we're finding some middle ground. However, $125 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $95? I think that's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We're increasing our offer, but staying well below her offer to signal we're willing to negotiate but not be pushed around.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning your budget, you're providing a reason for your counteroffer, making it seem less arbitrary.
* **Targeting a Sweet Spot:** $95 is just below your $100 limit, giving you a little wiggle room in case Alice counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $95 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a good price for both of us and allows me to cover my costs. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Quite:** $110 is getting very close to your $100 limit, but it's still over. Every dollar saved is a win.
* **Alice is Flexible:**  Alice has consistently lowered her price, indicating she's motivated to sell and likely willing to negotiate further. 
* **Few Rounds Left:**  While you have a few rounds left, getting closer to John's price might make Alice more agreeable to a deal closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate your flexibility.  Tell you what, how about we meet in the middle at $105? That's a firm offer from me."",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:** This counteroffer is a small increase from your previous offer, showing Alice you're willing to move slightly.
* **""Meet in the Middle"":**  This phrasing makes your offer seem more appealing and implies it's a fair compromise.
* **""Firm Offer"":** By stating it's a firm offer, you're introducing a sense of urgency and signaling that this is your final price.  
* **Above Limit, But Calculated:** While $105 is slightly above your $100 limit,  it's a strategic move. You're hoping Alice might accept it to avoid further negotiation, but you're also prepared to walk away if needed and buy from John."
