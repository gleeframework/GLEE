Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,450,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1450000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""potential,"" I'm hinting at the product's value without revealing my hand entirely. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains friendly and invites Bob to counter, indicating I'm willing to negotiate. 

My strategy is to start high and gradually decrease the price while gauging Bob's reactions. I'll keep John's offer in mind as my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches my absolute minimum. While I could accept and break even, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting, I signal that I value the product higher and encourage him to potentially increase his offer. I'm willing to risk another round since John's offer provides a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I recognize the value you see in this product, my original asking price reflects its full potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,325,000?"", ""product_price"": 1325000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significantly higher price than Bob's offer and my minimum. 
* **Highlighting Potential:** I reiterate the product's ""full potential"" to subtly reinforce its worth beyond Bob's current perception.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Bob's flexibility. A strong reaction might signal his limit, while a counter-offer keeps the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer is a good deal higher than my minimum and a reasonable compromise. While I could push further, there's a risk he might walk away. Accepting now secures a profit and avoids potentially losing the sale to John's standing offer."
