"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it can be a game changer. I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $850,000 is a decent offer, it doesn't fully reflect the value this product can bring to your business. I'm willing to come down a bit to $950,000. This price allows us both to walk away feeling like we've secured a good deal.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
