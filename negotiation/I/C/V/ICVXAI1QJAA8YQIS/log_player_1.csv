Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer aims for a middle ground, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a profit higher than your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $90 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While $90 is slightly lower than my initial offer, it's still a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
