"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value, giving him some room to negotiate, but it also leaves room for me to increase the price in later rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further, especially since we're only in Round 2. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my goal, and potentially get closer to a deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $9250. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and we're already in round 4.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,000, the risk of going further with counteroffers could lead to a stalemate or him walking away. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a profit that's above my minimum. There's also a chance that he might surprise me and accept a higher counteroffer in the next round, but I'm not willing to risk losing the deal entirely."
