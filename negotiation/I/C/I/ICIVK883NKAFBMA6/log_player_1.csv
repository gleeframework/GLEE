{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product at a price of $1,500,000.  It's a significant opportunity, and I believe it's priced competitively.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Value Emphasis:** I emphasize the product's unique nature and potential value to Bob. 
* **Competitiveness:**  I mention the price is ""competitive"" to subtly suggest it's a fair deal, without revealing my bottom line.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I leave the door open for further discussion and counteroffers.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer sets the stage for negotiation.  Depending on Bob's response, I can:

* **Accept a counteroffer:**  If Bob's counteroffer is within a reasonable range, I'll accept to secure the sale.
* **Counteroffer:** If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I'll counter with a lower price, but still above my minimum.
* **Walk away:**  If Bob's counteroffers are consistently too low, or if the negotiation drags on, I'll sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, but still higher than his offer. This will allow for further negotiation while maintaining a more favorable position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to negotiate further.  I'm open to selling for $1,100,000. This price reflects the value I know this product holds. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's. This shows I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Highlight Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to emphasize why the price is justified. 
* **Focus on Common Ground:** I encourage further negotiation, hinting at the possibility of reaching an agreement.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain Leverage:** My counteroffer is still above my minimum, giving me room to negotiate further.
* **Show Flexibility:**  Demonstrating a willingness to compromise can help secure a deal.
* **Keep Options Open:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can still counter again or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, it's still significantly lower. Accepting this offer would mean selling the product for considerably less than its worth to me. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum.  This will allow for further negotiation and hopefully bring us closer to a mutually acceptable price.  I'm still willing to walk away if Bob's offers continue to be too low."

{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your position, but $900,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, and I truly believe this product will be valuable for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my price again, but I'm not giving in completely.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, trying to persuade him to see its worth.
* **""Fair Compromise"":** I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise to make it more appealing.
* **Open-ended Question:** I'm asking for his thoughts to keep the negotiation open and encourage further discussion.
