"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to negotiate further.  I'm open to selling for $1100000. This price reflects the value I know this product holds. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your position, but $900000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a fair compromise, and I truly believe this product will be valuable for you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
