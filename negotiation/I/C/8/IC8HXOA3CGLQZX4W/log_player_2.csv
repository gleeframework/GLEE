"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product at a special price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,300,000. This is a one-time offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've mentioned the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is below your maximum budget, it's still higher than John's offer of $1,500,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or proceed with purchasing from John at a more favorable price."
