"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. Rejecting gives you the opportunity to negotiate a better price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I would only be willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer (but not insultingly low) can help gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially lead to a more favorable deal. There's a chance Alice might reject it outright, but it leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $8,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming closer to your acceptable price, but it's still above what John is offering.  There's room for further negotiation to potentially secure a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for working with me on the price. While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a little hesitant.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer aims to land close to the middle ground between Alice's current offer ($11,000) and your target price ($10,000). It signals that you're serious about buying but still want a competitive price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm now offering the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has stated this is the lowest she'll go, and at $10,500, it's still more expensive than buying from John for $10,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a better price from Alice."
