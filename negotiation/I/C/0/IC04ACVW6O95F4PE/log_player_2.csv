"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! It's a fantastic opportunity to get it for a steal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $110 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $120 from John.  There's a chance you could negotiate a better price with Alice or find a better deal elsewhere."
