"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This price still leaves room for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway at $1,125,000. This price is fair to both of us and allows for a reasonable profit margin. Let's finalize this deal.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
