,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $65.",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $65. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we say $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $90 is still a bit much for my budget. Could we settle on $75? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite willing to go all the way to $75, Bob. But I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet in the middle at $85?",85.0,Alice,5,
