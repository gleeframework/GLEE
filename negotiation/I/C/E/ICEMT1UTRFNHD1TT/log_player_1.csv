Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $13,000. I believe it will be incredibly valuable for you, even beyond the price."", ""product_price"": 13000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land closer to your goal. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial high price will help me understand how eager Bob is to purchase. If he flat-out rejects it, I know he's price-sensitive. If he counters, it indicates he's willing to negotiate.
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, so I can afford to be patient and aim high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is simply too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  It's a fair price, considering my budget and the value I see in it. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While it's a step up from his initial valuation, I have room to negotiate further. I'm willing to counter and see if we can reach a compromise closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is significant, and $13,000 is a fair reflection of that. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This feels like a reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 11500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By reducing my price by $1,500, I demonstrate willingness to negotiate and meet Bob partway. 
* **Stay Above Target:** My counteroffer is still comfortably above my $10,000 minimum, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Justify the Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to ensure Bob understands it's not an arbitrary price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,500 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm confident that $9,500 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below my absolute minimum of $10,000. While it's tempting to try and negotiate further, there's a significant risk that:

* **Bob won't budge much:**  He's already moved considerably from his initial offer. 
* **Time is valuable:** Further negotiation rounds might not result in a price I'm happy with, and I risk losing the guaranteed sale to John.

Since John offers a guaranteed $10,000, which meets my minimum, it's the most logical decision at this point."
