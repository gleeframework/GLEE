```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  It's a good price, but there's potential to save even more. By rejecting, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than his maximum budget of $1,200,000 and it's likely closer to Alice's desired price. There's a risk that Alice might reject further counteroffers, and Bob could end up paying more or having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures a good price and avoids further negotiation risks."
