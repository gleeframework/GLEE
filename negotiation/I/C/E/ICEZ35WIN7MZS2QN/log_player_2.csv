Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant discount from my initial price, but I'm still not sure I'm willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value this product can bring to your business. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're firm on your maximum offer of $800000, but I'm still not convinced that's enough to let you have this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options
