"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1500000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000, which is my maximum. If you're open to negotiation, let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant discount from my initial price, but I'm still not sure I'm willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value this product can bring to your business. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still outside my price range. While I understand the value of this product, I'm sticking to my maximum offer of $800000.  If you're serious about selling, this is the best I can do.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're firm on your maximum offer of $800000, but I'm still not convinced that's enough to let you have this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options",1100000.0,Alice,5,
