Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110.  It's a great deal, and I think it's worth it for you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's valuation of $80, but leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum of $120.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell it for that low of a price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. Would you be willing to go down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $95 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I've already negotiated with Bob, and  I don't want to risk a prolonged negotiation. John is guaranteed to pay my minimum, so it's the safer option."
