"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal if you're open to negotiating further.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your offer, I believe $1,300,000 doesn't fully reflect the product's true worth.  However, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1,375,000. This price acknowledges your initial proposal while remaining fair for the value I'm offering. What do you think?",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,375,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $1,325,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and our negotiation so far.
