"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $1,500,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to save as much as possible.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1,250,000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,325,000? This price is still a fantastic value for you, and it gives me a fair return on my product. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my target price. How about we meet in the middle again? I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit low. Let's meet in the middle again at $1,312,500. It's a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal.  What do you think?",1312500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'd be willing to pay $1,275,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle one more time?",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to agree on a price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,290,000 as a final offer.  This is a fair price that considers your target price, but it's also close to my minimum. If you're not willing to go higher, I'll need to start thinking about my other options.",1290000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'd be willing to pay $1,260,000 for the product. I'm getting close to my limit, but I'd like to try to find a mutually beneficial price.",1260000.0,Bob,8,
