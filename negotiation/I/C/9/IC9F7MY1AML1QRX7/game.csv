"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. How about we meet in the middle at $82? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to consider a price of $78? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $78. I'm willing to make one more concession - how about we meet at $81? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",81.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $78 and $81, which would be $79.50. Would you be willing to accept that price?",79.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $79.50. I'm willing to make one more concession - how about we meet at $80? It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's still a great deal for you. If not, I'll have to consider selling to John for $80.",80.0,Alice,7,
