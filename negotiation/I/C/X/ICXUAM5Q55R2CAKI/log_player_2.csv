"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  I think it could really benefit you. I'm asking for $1,150,000, which reflects its significant value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product from John for a lower price, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be closer to $1,150,000 for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I'm confident this will be a valuable investment for you.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a lower price than her initial offer, it's still above his budget and higher than John's price. He should continue negotiating with Alice or move to John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go any lower than $1,090,000. This is my final offer - I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's final offer is still higher than John's price, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a better outcome. It's best to secure the product from John and save money."
