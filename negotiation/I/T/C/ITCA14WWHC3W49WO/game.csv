"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe you'll find extremely valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2,000,000.

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product, considering its value to me. This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,900,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still a bit high. I can go up to $1,800,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $1,800,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,850,000, which is a compromise that should satisfy both of us. This is my final offer, and I hope we can conclude the sale at this price.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
