"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  I'm willing to come down to $850000.  This price reflects the product's true worth while still leaving room for a fair deal for both of us. Let's keep this negotiation moving forward.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're not able to accept this offer, I'll have to move on to another seller.",800000.0,Bob,4,
