Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset while I get a fair price. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on it and the fact that I'm ready to make a deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000. This is a good compromise, and it still allows you to acquire this valuable product at a competitive price."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but that's my final offer.  Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. There's a risk that if I reject him, he'll walk away and I'll have to sell to John.  Therefore, I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
