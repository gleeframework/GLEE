# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable given the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1000000, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to discuss further.

Alice's counteroffer of $1,000,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  While there might be further room for negotiation, Bob can secure the product for his desired price by buying from John. There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially get stuck with a higher price."
