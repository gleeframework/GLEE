"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the product's value, $1200000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which is my maximum price.  I'm confident this is a fair price given my needs and the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1000000, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to discuss further.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
