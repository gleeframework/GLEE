Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $119. I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get a higher price from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While your minimum is $120, starting with a price of $119 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Create Urgency:**  The phrase ""for a steal"" is intended to make Bob think he's getting a great deal and might miss out if he doesn't act fast.

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
