"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle? ",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we compromise at $900,000? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I could do $650,000. What do you say?",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $750,000? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,5,
