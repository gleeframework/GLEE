Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I think the product is worth a lot to me, but I'm not willing to pay that much. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,075,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to the guaranteed sale price from John, we still have room to negotiate. It's likely Bob is willing to go a bit higher, and we want to maximize our profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try this - $1,100,000, and we have a deal. This is a significant discount on its true value."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  At this point, we're getting closer to the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. Offering $1,100,000 leaves some room for Bob to counter slightly higher while still securing a price significantly above John's offer. This approach balances risk and potential reward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the full $1,100,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has essentially met us halfway between our last two offers. While we could potentially push for a bit more, we're running the risk of Bob lowering his offer or stalling the negotiations. Accepting $1,075,000 guarantees a significant profit above John's offer and avoids the potential of having to settle for John's price if negotiations stall further."
