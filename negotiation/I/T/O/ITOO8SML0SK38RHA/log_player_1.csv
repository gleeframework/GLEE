Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us. You get a valuable product at a good price, and I get a quick sale. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to my minimum value ($1,000,000) but still within a range Bob might find appealing.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:**  The message highlights the potential win-win for both of us, making it more likely Bob will consider the offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I've left some room for negotiation in case Bob wants to counteroffer. 
* **Backup Plan:**  I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not desperate to make a quick deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $700,000.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $700,000 is significantly less than my minimum value of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  While Bob's offer is low, there's a chance we can negotiate to a price closer to my desired value.  
* **John as a Safety Net:** I have John as a buyer who's willing to pay my minimum price, so I don't need to settle for a significantly lower offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Closer to My Minimum:** I'm offering a price closer to my desired value, but still lower than my original offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to sway him towards a higher price.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** I've kept the message open-ended, suggesting that we can still negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm really trying to stay closer to my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle at $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired value of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for Better Outcome:** I'm not desperate for a sale, and there's a chance I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **John is a Reliable Backup:** Having John as a buyer who's willing to pay my full price gives me the security to hold out for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $775,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This is a significant concession on my end, and I hope you'll consider it. If you're serious about acquiring the product, I believe this price is fair and reflects its value.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a genuine attempt to reach a compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value and highlighting the significant concession I'm making.
* **Focus on Fair Deal:**  I'm framing the price as fair and reasonable, emphasizing that it reflects the product's worth.
* **Setting a Deadline (Implied):** The phrase ""If you're serious about acquiring the product"" subtly implies a potential end to the negotiations if Bob doesn't accept.  

I'm still trying to get as close to my minimum value as possible, but I'm also showing flexibility to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further, how about $800,000 even? That's the absolute best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $800,000 is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept. 
* **John Offers More:**  John is willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, a significantly higher price than Bob's offer. 
* **Time is Valuable:**  Continuing negotiations could drag on and potentially lead to a lower price or a stalemate. Selling to John guarantees me the highest possible return.

While Bob's offer is my minimum, John's offer provides a more financially rewarding outcome.  It's more advantageous to sell to John and secure the higher price."
