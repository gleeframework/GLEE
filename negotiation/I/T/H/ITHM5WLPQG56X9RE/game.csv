,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $8,500?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $10,000 is a fair reflection of its value, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,250? This feels like a good compromise.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $8,000, but that's the maximum I can afford. Can you meet me at $8,000 or lower?",8000.0,Bob,4,
