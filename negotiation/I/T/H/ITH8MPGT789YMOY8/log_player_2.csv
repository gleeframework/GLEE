Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I'm glad you like it. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.

While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'll continue negotiating and see if I can get the price closer to my desired range."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob! I can see that we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500 was a bit too high, but $9,000 is a good starting point. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

While I'd prefer a lower price, $9,250 is a good compromise. It's within my budget and a decent deal considering John's price. I'll accept Alice's offer."
