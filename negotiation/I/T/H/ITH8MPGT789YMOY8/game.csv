"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. How about $8,500?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I'm glad you like it. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's see if we can make this deal work!",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob! I can see that we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500 was a bit too high, but $9,000 is a good starting point. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,5,
