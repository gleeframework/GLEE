"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  This feels like a fair compromise.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm comfortable going up to $10,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
