"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price for a great product like this.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your target, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. How about we meet at $105? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to get the sale done.",105.0,Alice,5,
