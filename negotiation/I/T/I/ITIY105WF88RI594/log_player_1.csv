Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your needs and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I offer it more broadly."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John, trying to get a higher price from Bob first is the best way to potentially maximize your profit.
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob accepts. He gets a $150,000 discount from the product's value to him, and you earn an extra $150,000 compared to selling to John.
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning that you'll offer the product more broadly if Bob declines adds a sense of urgency and might encourage him to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. There's an element of risk, as Bob might reject the offer and you'll lose the chance to earn the extra $150,000. You could choose a less aggressive price closer to $1,200,000 to minimize this risk."
