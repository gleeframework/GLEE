"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,
