Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $120 to me, I'll offer it to Bob at a price that's slightly higher than that. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 130}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price, so I'll reject it and try to get a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my minimum price. Here's my counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 115}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'll be prepared to negotiate further or sell the product to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob rejected my initial offer of $130 and made a counteroffer of $105, I'll make a new offer that's higher than his offer but still lower than my minimum price. Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 112}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'll be prepared to negotiate further or sell the product to John if necessary."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $100. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer that's higher than his offer. Here's my counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 110}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'll be prepared to sell the product to John if necessary."

{""product_price"": 108}

I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us, but if Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to sell the product to John if necessary."
