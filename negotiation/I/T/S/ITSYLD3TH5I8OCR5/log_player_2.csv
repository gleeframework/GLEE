Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's truly exceptional and I believe it would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and quality, I propose a price of $15000. I hope this aligns with your expectations and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
