"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible.  He's starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within the range of what he's willing to pay. This will give him room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's limit, he can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He's only had two rounds, and there's still a chance he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise.  He's still below his $12,000 limit, but getting closer to Alice's price, hoping to find a middle ground."
