Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
