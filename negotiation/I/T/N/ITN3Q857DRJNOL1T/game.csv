"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. I'm willing to pay that much, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher.",120.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  However, $120 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $170?",170.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to meet in the middle, but $170 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",140.0,Bob,4,
