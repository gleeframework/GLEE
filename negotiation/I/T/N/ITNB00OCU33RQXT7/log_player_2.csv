{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Starting at $1,000,000 is a bold move, but it sets a strong negotiating position and leaves room for compromise.  This price is still well below Bob's maximum budget, so there's no risk in making this offer."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is only a very small change from her initial offer.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to push for a lower price. While John's offer is always a fallback option, Bob can likely get a better price through continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still very close to her initial price.  While buying from John is always an option, Bob should continue to negotiate and see if he can get a lower price from Alice. There are still several rounds left, and there's room for further compromise."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000}
```

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now asking for more than her initial offer. While this is a sign that she's getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above Bob's ideal.  Since there are still rounds left, Bob should continue to negotiate and see if he can get a better price. Buying from John is always an option, but Bob can likely get a better price through continued negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's final offer, and it's at the very top of his ideal price range. Alice has been firm in her negotiations, and Bob recognizes that he needs to be willing to compromise. By offering $1,200,000, Bob is showing a willingness to meet Alice halfway, while still getting a good deal. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob is prepared to move on to John, but he's hoping to secure a deal with Alice at this price."
