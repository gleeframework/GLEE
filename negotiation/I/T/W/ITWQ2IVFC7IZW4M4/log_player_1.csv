Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is a significant profit for me and still within a range that Bob might consider.
* **Focus on Value:** My message highlights the product's value to Bob, making the offer seem more appealing.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for negotiation, as Bob likely won't accept the first offer. 
* **Backup Plan:** I have John as a backup buyer to ensure I get at least $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for some room for both of us to come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,250,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for counteroffer:** I can still negotiate with Bob and hopefully reach a price closer to my desired range. 
* **John is a backup:** Knowing I have John as a backup buyer gives me the leverage to reject Bob's offer without risking losing the sale entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial offer:** This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a reasonable price.
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:** I emphasize that this price would benefit both of us, making the counteroffer seem more attractive.
* **Focus on negotiation:** My message encourages further discussion and a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1350000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1300000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of further concessions and a final price that might be lower than my minimum.
* **Secure the best deal:** Selling to John guarantees me the highest price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation. 

I'm confident that John will be a reliable buyer and I'm not willing to risk a lower price for the sake of a potential agreement with Bob."
