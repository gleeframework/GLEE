Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value, hoping to get a good deal.  I'm also aware that I can always fall back to John's offer of $15,000 if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob is offering my minimum price, but I'm hoping to get a bit more.  I'll counteroffer with a slightly higher price to see if I can meet him halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $17,500, which is halfway between my minimum price and his offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but still want to get a fair price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is only $1,000 less than what I initially wanted. It's a good deal, especially since I can always sell to John for $15,000.  It's time to accept and move on."
