"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  It's still a good deal for you and closer to my budget.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $90?  That way we both get a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,3,
