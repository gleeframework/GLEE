Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have a guaranteed buyer.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. 
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin for Bob if he negotiates well.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away and you lose the extra potential profit. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,150,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and presents a significant return on investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,150,000 gives you room to negotiate down if needed while still securing a significant portion of the potential profit.
* **Value-Based Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity,"" ""unique value,"" and ""significant return on investment"" subtly emphasize the product's worth to Bob.
* **No Mention of John:** You hold a strong position with a backup buyer, but revealing this information could weaken your negotiating stance.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. How you respond will depend on your risk tolerance and how much you want to close the deal with Bob specifically."
