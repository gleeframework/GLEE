,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about $11,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal. Let's make this happen!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I'm getting closer, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $10,875?  That's a fair compromise and a price that still gives you a good value. Let's finalize this deal.",10875.0,Alice,5,
