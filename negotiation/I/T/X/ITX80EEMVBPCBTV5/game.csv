"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,350,000? This would ensure a fair deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your understanding, Alice. I'm willing to go back to my previous offer of $1,300,000, but I need some time to think about it. Can you give me 24 hours to consider it? If I decide to go with it, I'll let you know ASAP. If not, I'll be looking elsewhere. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
