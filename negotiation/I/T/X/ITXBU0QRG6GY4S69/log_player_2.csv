# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth $1,200,000 to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects its true value to me.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, he can still get the product for less from John. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,025,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit. I'll make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $1,075,000, which is still a good deal considering its value to me. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John for $1,000,000. Alice has been unwilling to budge on her price, and the negotiation is not likely to lead to a lower price.  It's better for Bob to secure the product for his desired price from John rather than risk getting stuck with a higher price from Alice."
