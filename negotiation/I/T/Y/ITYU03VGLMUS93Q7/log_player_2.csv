"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is the maximum price I'm willing to pay.  There's no reason to accept it right away. I'll see if I can get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you consider $750,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $750,000 is a substantial drop from her initial offer, but still leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still a bit high, but it's a good sign that she's willing to negotiate. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price of $750,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $825,000?  That's a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident we can reach a deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm moving closer to Alice's last offer but still keeping a gap to create further room for negotiation.  $825,000 is a good compromise that shows I'm serious about closing the deal, but also that I'm not going to accept her first offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $825000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $875,000, which is only $50,000 more than my last counteroffer.  While I would prefer to pay $825,000, I've been negotiating for a few rounds and don't want to risk going too far and potentially losing the deal.  Since I'm only $50,000 away from my ideal price and I don't want to spend more than $1,000,000, accepting this offer is the best choice."
