"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial price.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me right now. I see the value in the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit hesitant.  Could we settle at $750,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. I believe it's still a fair price for both parties.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $850,000 is very close to what I can manage, but I need to be sure I'm getting the best possible deal.  Would you consider meeting me in the middle at $825,000? This would be a strong show of good faith and would allow us to close the deal today.",825000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your desire to get the best possible deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",875000.0,Alice,7,
