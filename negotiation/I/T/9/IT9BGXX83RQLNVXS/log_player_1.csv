"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for you, as you know the value of this product is at least $800,000 to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that is higher than what the product is worth to Bob but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for a potential win-win situation.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm framing the offer by highlighting the value Bob would get, making it more appealing to him.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The initial offer is high enough to provide room for negotiation, but not so high as to be immediately rejected. 

**Note:** I'm aware that I could potentially sell to John for $1,000,000, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob.  I'm confident that by starting high and being open to negotiation, I can find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product is high to you, but considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value you place on your product while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $1,000,000 I could get from John. 
* **Potential for higher counteroffer:** I believe I can push for a higher price with a counteroffer. 
* **Strategic negotiation:** By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I demonstrate that I'm serious about getting the best possible price.

**Next steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit far from my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that considers both our interests.  Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer closer to Bob's offer:** My counteroffer is significantly closer to Bob's offer, signaling my willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above minimum:**  $1,100,000 is still higher than my minimum price of $1,000,000, and it leaves some room for future negotiation if needed.
* **Focus on compromise:** I emphasize the word ""compromise"" to highlight that I'm trying to find a solution that works for both of us. 
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone encourages Bob to keep negotiating. 

**Goal:** This counteroffer aims to nudge Bob closer to my desired price while maintaining a good negotiating relationship."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering your latest offer, I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise between respecting the value of your product and staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a near-optimal price:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob as a buyer and potentially ending up with a lower offer. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  While I could potentially get a slightly higher price with further negotiation, the time and effort involved may not be worth the potential gain.  

**Conclusion:**  It's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer and close the deal.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good outcome considering the negotiation process."
