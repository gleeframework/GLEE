"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) and a bit above what I believe Bob might be willing to pay. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed, while still maximizing my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I can still try to get more. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $155. This is still above my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation, but it's also a significant increase from Bob's last offer, showing that I'm not willing to accept a price too far below my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating."
