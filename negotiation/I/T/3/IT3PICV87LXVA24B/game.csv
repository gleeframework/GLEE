,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000. I hope this aligns better with what you're considering.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints and appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1200000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for. How about we meet in the middle at $1350000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to move forward.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I've reviewed our conversation and while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must respectfully decline the $1350000 proposal. My budget constraints remain firm, and I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1300000. This still falls within my maximum acceptable range, and I hope this can facilitate a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
