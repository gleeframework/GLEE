"I understand your concerns about staying within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from my minimum price of $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $136. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",136.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're close to making a decision, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $137. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $138. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",138.0,Alice,7,
