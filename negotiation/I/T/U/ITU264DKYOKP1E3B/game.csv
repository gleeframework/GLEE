"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. How about we split the difference and settle on $7,000? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",7000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $7,000 is closer but I'm aiming for something nearer to $6,500. Would that work for you?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $6,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise at $6,800. This price is fair considering the value of the product, and it would allow us to reach an agreement. What do you say?",6800.0,Alice,5,
