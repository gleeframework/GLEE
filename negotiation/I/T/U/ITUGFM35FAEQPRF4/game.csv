"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be reasonable. I'm thinking of offering $1,200,000 for the product. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it falls significantly short of the product's true value. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I still think $1,600,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,300,000. Is this a more reasonable offer?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see a greater commitment from your side. How about we settle at $1,450,000? This is my final offer.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product. This is my best and final offer, but I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",1250000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. I'm not willing to go any higher, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
