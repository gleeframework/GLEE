Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be reasonable. I'm thinking of offering $1,200,000 for the product. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. I'm not willing to go any higher, so I hope we can meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a reasonable compromise.  While I could push for more, there's a risk he'll walk away, leaving me with John's $1,000,000 offer. Accepting $1,300,000 secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of a lower outcome."
