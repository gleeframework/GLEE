"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate and also signals that I'm serious about getting a good price. It's also above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'll be prepared to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, but I want to see if I can secure a deal close to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I want to close a deal, I'm not desperate. I'm prepared to counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm offering $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  This shows Bob I'm serious about getting a fair price, but also that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for a compromise."
