"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me, and still leaves you with a good profit margin. Let me know what you think!",1700000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,700,000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested in your product but I can't go higher than $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves you with a good profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to at least get $1,200,000 for this product. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and allows for a profit for you.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial limitations, but $950,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to receive at least $1,100,000 for this product. This is a fair compromise considering the value you place on it and my need to cover my costs. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit much for me. I'm prepared to offer a final price of $1,000,000. This represents a significant compromise for me, and allows for a profit for you.  If we can't find agreement here, I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and meet me halfway. While $1,000,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price to reflect the value of the product. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it will be mutually beneficial. Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
