Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Bottom Line:** $1,000,000 (John's guaranteed offer)
* **Bob's Valuation:** $1,200,000
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $200,000 (Difference between Bob's valuation and your bottom line)

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's closer to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation without being so high that he'd rather walk away. 

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to own this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering what you could gain from it."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob.
* **Price:** $1,150,000 is a strong starting point. It leaves room for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is paramount, a slightly lower, more immediately agreeable offer could be strategic.

**Remember:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob, but always keep your bottom line ($1,000,000) in mind."
