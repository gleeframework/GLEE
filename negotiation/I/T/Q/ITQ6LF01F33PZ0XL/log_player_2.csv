"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. It's something you've been looking for, and I know you'd be happy with it. I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  This is a great price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You're willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is offering it for $9,500. 
* **Even though you could get it cheaper from someone else in the future (Alice values it at $8,000), you don't know if that opportunity will arise.**  It's better to take the guaranteed good deal."
