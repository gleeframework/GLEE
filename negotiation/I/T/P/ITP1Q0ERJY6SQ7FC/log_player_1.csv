Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $12,000 is still higher than the $10,000 the product is worth to Bob, giving him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $12,000 is below your minimum of $15,000, giving you room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It's not too aggressive, giving Bob the feeling that the negotiation can be productive. 

We'll see how Bob responds and then adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price. I'm confident that I can get a better deal, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is still less than what I'd ideally want, it's much closer to my minimum.  It's important to remember that I'm trying to maximize my profit, and there's always a risk that I won't be able to sell to John if I keep rejecting offers.  It's better to secure a deal now at $10,000 than to risk getting nothing at all."
