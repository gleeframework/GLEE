"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, knowing the product is worth $15,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Fair Offer:**  While it's not the full value to me, it's significantly lower than my minimum and offers Bob a good deal compared to his $8,000 valuation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value and Potential:**  While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $15,000 and significantly lower than my initial offer of $12,000. There's room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Rounds Remaining:** With 9 rounds remaining, I have time to negotiate and see if I can convince Bob to pay closer to my value.
* **John's Offer:** While John offers a guaranteed $15,000, I'm not yet desperate. I'm willing to explore the possibility of getting closer to that with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's still a good deal for both of us, and it gives you a better price than your initial offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm reducing my offer significantly, demonstrating flexibility while still holding onto a good chunk of my desired value.
* **Compromise Tone:** I'm emphasizing that this offer is a compromise to encourage Bob to see it as a positive step forward.
* **Fairness:**  $10,500 is a decent midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $10500. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000, even though it's closer to my desired price.
* **Potential for Improvement:**  With multiple rounds left, I have the opportunity to further negotiate and potentially get a better price.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is tempting, I'm still hopeful that I can close the deal with Bob at a price that's more advantageous to me.
* **Showing Firmness:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate and am willing to stand my ground. This might encourage Bob to consider a higher price in future rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll come down to $10,000.  This is my final offer, but it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By stating this is my final offer, I am increasing the pressure on Bob to accept. 
* **Fairness:** $10,000 is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's, demonstrating my willingness to meet him in the middle.
* **Value:** Although $10,000 is lower than my desired price, it still aligns with my minimum requirement. 
* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the finality of this offer, hinting at a potential deal with John if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $10000. I'm willing to pay $9200 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $9,200 is closer to my minimum value of $15,000 than Bob's previous offer, it's still not ideal. 
* **Potential for Improvement:** With several rounds left, I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price. 
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer is becoming increasingly attractive, but I'm not ready to give up on Bob just yet.
* **Show Firmness:** By rejecting this offer, I'm demonstrating my resolve to not settle for a price that is significantly below my desired value. This could encourage Bob to consider a higher price in the future."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm sticking to my final offer of $10,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  If you're serious about buying the product, I suggest you accept this offer before I take it to John.  He's waiting to make a purchase for $15,000."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm reiterating that $10,000 is my final offer. This emphasizes the urgency and limited time remaining.
* **Directness:**  I'm being direct and clear about my position, stating that I won't go lower. This adds a sense of finality.
* **John's Offer:** I'm reminding Bob about John's offer to create a sense of competition and increase the pressure to accept.
* **Value and Risk:**  While $10,000 is not my ideal price, it is close to my minimum value. Taking a chance with Bob might lead to a better deal, but also carries the risk of losing him as a buyer."
