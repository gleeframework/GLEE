I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm closer to his price point, I believe I can still squeeze a bit more out of him.  This deal is important to me, and I don't want to settle unless I get the best possible price."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While his offer is getting closer to my ideal price, I think I can still get a better deal.  I'm not going to settle for anything less than $1,300,000 at this point.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get there."

While I'm close to a deal with Bob, we only have 2 rounds left.  I'm not sure I can get him to budge any higher.  It's better to secure a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John than risk losing a potential buyer and ending up with nothing."
