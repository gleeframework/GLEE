"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer, but I'm still a bit above $11000. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10500. Is that something you'd be comfortable with?",10500.0,Bob,4,
