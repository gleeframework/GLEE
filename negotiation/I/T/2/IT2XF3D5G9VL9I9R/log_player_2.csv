"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price of $135. It's a fantastic deal, and you know it's worth at least $120 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While Alice's offer of $135 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $120 from John.  You should reject Alice's offer and go with the guaranteed lower price."
