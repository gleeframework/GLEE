{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $1,350,000.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before accepting her offer or going to John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 
 
I'm offering $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the fact that I can always go to John for $1,200,000."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still too high. It's best to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  John's offer of $1,200,000 is still a viable backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm offering $1,300,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's current offer. I'm hoping Alice sees the value in making a deal at this price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is still offering a price higher than my maximum budget.  While I could technically accept and be within my budget, John's offer remains a more attractive option.  Let's keep negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm offering $1,350,000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, showing flexibility while still keeping the price within my budget.  I'm hoping Alice will see this as a good compromise and accept the deal."
