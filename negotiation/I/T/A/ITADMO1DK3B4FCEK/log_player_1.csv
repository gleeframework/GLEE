Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob while still aiming for a price significantly higher than his perceived value.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** The message aims to convey confidence in the product's value while not appearing overly aggressive, which could scare Bob away. 

This strategy balances the risk of losing Bob with the potential for maximizing your profit."
