"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great deal, as you know the value of this product is very high. Let's start the negotiation, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, and I'm not willing to accept his offer yet.  I'll try to counteroffer with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth significantly more than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. I'm thinking of offering $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum desired price of $1,500,000, I'm still hesitant to accept. I'm only two rounds away from selling to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000, so I'm going to try to push for a slightly higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $1,400,000 still isn't quite there for me.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,450,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to come closer to my desired price.  I believe this is a deal we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to a deal, Alice, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking of offering $1,350,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the wire, and Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. With only four rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob and ending up with nothing is too high.  It's time to secure the guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000."
