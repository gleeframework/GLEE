Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 creates a potential win-win:
    * Bob gets the product for $300,000 less than its value to him.
    * You make $300,000 more than your guaranteed sale to John. 

This strategy aims for the highest possible profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
