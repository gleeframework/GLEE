"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the market value and other similar products I've seen.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but I believe my initial offer reflects the true value and potential of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,100,000? This offer takes into account both our positions and paves the way for a successful deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price, considering the market value and what I've learned about the product.",980000.0,Bob,6,
