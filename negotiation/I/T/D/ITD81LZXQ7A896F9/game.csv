"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,100,000. I'm confident this represents a fair price, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my understanding of the market value, I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects both the product's potential and my budget. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I know how valuable this product can be for you, so I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered and leaves us both with a fair deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the market and my own valuation. Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
