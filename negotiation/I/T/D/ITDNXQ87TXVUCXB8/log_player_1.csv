"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $1,100,000. It's a steal considering its value to you! Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,100,000:** This price is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value to Bob. It also encourages a deal to be made.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer allows for room to negotiate while still maximizing potential profit. I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum of $1,200,000 as possible within the 10 rounds. However, I also keep in mind the option of selling to John if negotiations with Bob prove to be too difficult or time-consuming."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm not willing to accept such a substantial loss. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range. There are still 8 rounds remaining, and I believe I can secure a better deal with Bob or potentially close the deal with John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  This price still allows you a significant value for the product, and it's closer to my minimum requirement."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$975,000:** This price is a compromise that's closer to my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's offer but expresses my unwillingness to accept it. It also emphasizes the value for Bob and presents the counteroffer as a fair compromise. 

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be appealing enough to Bob to start a more productive negotiation.  My goal is to push the price higher in subsequent rounds while keeping an eye on the possibility of selling to John if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $975,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we agree on $900,000? That feels like a fair deal to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's closer to my desired range than his previous offer, I'm not yet ready to accept.

**Strategy:**

I will continue to negotiate with Bob. There are still six rounds left, and I believe I can push the price higher. However, I will keep in mind the option of selling to John if negotiations with Bob continue to stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 simply doesn't cover the value this product offers you. I'm willing to come down slightly more, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated.  Let's settle on $950,000. This price still provides you with a great deal, and it's closer to my minimum requirement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000:** This price is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's budget constraints but emphasizes the value of the product. It also presents the counteroffer as a final concession. 

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be appealing enough to Bob to finally reach an agreement.  However, if he rejects it, I will continue to negotiate while remaining open to the option of selling to John.  The time is ticking, and I need to ensure I secure a decent deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $920,000.  That's a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects the value of the product fairly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $920,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I need to ensure I get a return that reflects the true value of the product.

**Strategy:**

I will continue to negotiate with Bob. There are four rounds remaining, and I believe I can push the price higher.  I'm also aware that time is running out, and I need to be prepared to sell to John if a deal with Bob isn't possible.  I will aim for a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price while still being reasonable."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make one last concession. How about $940,000? This price is a good compromise that allows you to acquire this valuable product while ensuring I'm fairly compensated. Let's reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$940,000:** This price is a compromise that's slightly higher than Bob's latest offer but still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm trying to find a middle ground and close the deal within the remaining rounds.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes a sense of urgency and compromise, highlighting the need to reach a deal within the limited rounds. 

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping this counteroffer will push Bob closer to my desired price. However, if he rejects it again, I will have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round.  The remaining rounds are crucial, and I need to maximize my chances of securing a profitable deal."
