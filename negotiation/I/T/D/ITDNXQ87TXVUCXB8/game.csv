"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  This price still allows you a significant value for the product, and it's closer to my minimum requirement.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $975,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we agree on $900,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 simply doesn't cover the value this product offers you. I'm willing to come down slightly more, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated.  Let's settle on $950,000. This price still provides you with a great deal, and it's closer to my minimum requirement.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $920,000.  That's a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects the value of the product fairly.",920000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make one last concession. How about $940,000? This price is a good compromise that allows you to acquire this valuable product while ensuring I'm fairly compensated. Let's reach a deal.",940000.0,Alice,7,
