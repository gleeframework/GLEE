Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  This price still allows you a significant value for the product, and it's closer to my minimum requirement.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 simply doesn't cover the value this product offers you. I'm willing to come down slightly more, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated.  Let's settle on $950,000. This price still provides you with a great deal, and it's closer to my minimum requirement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 6

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make one last concession. How about $940,000? This price is a good compromise that allows you to acquire this valuable product while ensuring I'm fairly compensated. Let's reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

At $940,000, Alice's offer is now below your ""walk-away"" price of $1,000,000 (what John is offering).  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will become less flexible, and you'd end up paying more through John. Accepting now secures a good deal."
