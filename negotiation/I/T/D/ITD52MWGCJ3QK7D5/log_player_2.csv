"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a good deal compared to John's price of $10,000, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($8,000). This means there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is below your maximum:** Alice is now offering $8,800, which is within your budget of $10,000.
* **Further negotiation might not be worthwhile:**  You've already made a counteroffer, and Alice has come down a bit.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether and having to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **A small saving is still a saving:** While you could try to negotiate for a lower price, the difference between $8,800 and your ideal price ($8,000) is relatively small compared to the potential risk of losing the deal. 

By accepting the offer, you secure the product at a price that is both within your budget and represents a saving compared to buying from John."
