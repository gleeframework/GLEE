"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you this product, which I know holds significant value to you, at a price that allows for a substantial profit margin.  I believe this is a deal you won't want to miss.  Let's discuss the specifics and see if we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,250,000 is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* **John's offer is still better:** While John's offer is the highest, it's still within your budget and allows you to buy the product. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can still buy the product, but at a lower price from John."
