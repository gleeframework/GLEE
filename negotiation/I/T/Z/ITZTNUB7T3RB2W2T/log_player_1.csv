"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a rare opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.  My initial offer is $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay up to $1250000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I'm confident I can get a better deal. Selling to John at this point would mean leaving $250,000 on the table, which isn't worth it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident this product is a great investment for you.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects the exceptional value of the product and allows for a profitable deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Given my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1300000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I have 6 rounds left and I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher. Selling to John now would leave a bigger amount of money on the table than I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm still not quite there yet. Given the unique value of this product, I'm proposing $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this opportunity."", ""product_price"": 1325000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see that you're still committed to finding a mutually beneficial solution, Alice. I am also keen on reaching an agreement within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1310000 for the product. I hope this proposal will lead to a successful negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,310,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,310,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 4 rounds remaining, Bob's offer is getting very close to my target price.  There's a good chance he won't budge much further. Selling to John now would result in a significantly lower profit, so accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision at this point."
