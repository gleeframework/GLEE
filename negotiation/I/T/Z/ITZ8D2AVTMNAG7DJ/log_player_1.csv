Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed, but also maximizes potential profit. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, subtly justifying the high price.
* **Direct Approach:**  The tone is confident and direct, making it clear this is a serious offer for a valuable item.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  How Bob responds will determine your next move. Be prepared to potentially negotiate, but always keep your $1,000,000 safety net with John in mind!"
