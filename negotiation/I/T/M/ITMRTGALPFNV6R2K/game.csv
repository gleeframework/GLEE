"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am unable to accept $1,000,000 for the product. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,150,000. This is the highest amount I can offer while still ensuring a reasonable profit for myself. I hope this proposal works for you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $1,150,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. Could we settle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
