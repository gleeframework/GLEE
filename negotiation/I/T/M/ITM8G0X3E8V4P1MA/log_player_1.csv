"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit.  This also gives me the opportunity to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $8,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still not comfortable with $8,500. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $7,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not ready to settle. I'm confident I can get closer to my goal by continuing the negotiation.  The product is worth more to me, and I'm willing to risk another round to try and secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $7,800 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I can't go below $8,200. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that we're both trying to reach a mutually agreeable outcome. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $7,900. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where the negotiation is getting more difficult. Bob is not willing to go higher than $7,900, which is still lower than my minimum.  To avoid further rounds of back and forth that might result in a price even lower than $7,900, it's time to cut my losses and accept John's offer. It's the safest option to guarantee the minimum value for my product."
