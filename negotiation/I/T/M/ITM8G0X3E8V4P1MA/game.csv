"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $8,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still not comfortable with $8,500. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $7,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $7,800 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I can't go below $8,200. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that we're both trying to reach a mutually agreeable outcome. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $7,900. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",7900.0,Bob,6,
