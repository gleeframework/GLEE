Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very slowly lowering her price.  At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a deal significantly below $10,000, which is what John is offering. It's time to cut our losses and buy from John."
