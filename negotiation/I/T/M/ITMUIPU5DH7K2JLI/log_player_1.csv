"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,750,000. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
This is a tricky situation. While $1,400,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. I believe there's room for negotiation, so I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's work towards a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $1,450,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'm running out of time and the risk of Bob continuing to lowball me is high. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John and move on."
