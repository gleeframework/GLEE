"I understand you're looking for a more reasonable price, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $17000. This is the lowest I can go, so I hope you can make it work.",17000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you consider $16500?",16500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession and I'm not willing to go any lower than $17000. I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal - I'll include a premium service package worth $1000. Would you be willing to meet me at $17000?",17000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the added value of the premium service package, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $16750, but that's as high as I can go.",16750.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you're really close to your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll sell you the product for $17200, and I'll also throw in the premium service package worth $1000. This is my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to explore other options.",17200.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've gone as high as I can, and I'm going to have to pass on this deal. I'll have to look elsewhere for a better option.",12000.0,Bob,10,
