Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $1,400,000 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By starting at a high price, I'm allowing for a back and forth negotiation that could potentially lead to a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $1,500,000 provides a safety net. If Bob's counteroffers become too low, I can always choose to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Room for Counter-Negotiation:** I have a safety net with John, so I can afford to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I can likely secure a higher price by making a counteroffer between Bob's offer and my initial offer, potentially finding a compromise around $1,300,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer within Range:** This counteroffer is within the range of the previous offers ($1,200,000 - $1,400,000), showing willingness to compromise.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Offering $1,300,000 presents a middle ground that could be appealing to both parties.
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:** While lower than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum acceptable price and ensures a decent profit."
