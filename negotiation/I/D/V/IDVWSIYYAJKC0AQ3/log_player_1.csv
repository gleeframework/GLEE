Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob has now hit his maximum valuation of the product at $800,000.  He's unlikely to go higher. Since your minimum acceptable price is $1,500,000 and you have a guaranteed offer from John at that price, it's in your best interest to sell to John. Continuing to negotiate with Bob is unlikely to yield a better outcome at this point."
