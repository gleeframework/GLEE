"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I have a limited budget, and I need to make sure it fits within it.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $8,750. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $8,750 is getting closer, I'm still a bit off my target. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,250. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher. I'm hoping we can find a way to make it work.",8750.0,Bob,6,
