``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still below your minimum desired price. This allows for room for negotiation while also setting a strong initial price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I have a limited budget, and I need to make sure it fits within it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $10,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I need to ensure I get closer to my desired value."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $8,750. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $8,750 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I need to get closer to my minimum goal of $10,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $8,750 is getting closer, I'm still a bit off my target. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,250. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher. I'm hoping we can find a way to make it work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's clear that Bob is unwilling to budge significantly.  At this point, I'm willing to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $10,000. While I'd like to get more, I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob, potentially leading to a lower price or a stalemate."
