Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. I'm hoping to get a higher price, but I'm also open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, and it's closer to my desired price. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum, and I've already got a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay that much. There's no reason to risk further negotiation, so I'm going to sell to John."
