"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm willing to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,500. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're still a bit hesitant on the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $7,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you and my own minimum requirements. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $7,250. At this point, accepting her last offer would mean losing out on a potential $750 saving.  It's more strategic to buy from John for $8,000 and secure the best possible price."
