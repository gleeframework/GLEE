"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $15,000. I believe it's a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is far too high, and Bob can do much better. He has 10 rounds to negotiate, and it's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering its value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  I'm confident you'll see its worth with continued use. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a step down from $15,000, $13,000 is still too high for Bob. He can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $8,500.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to make a deal happen.  While $8,500 is low, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a significant price reduction, reflecting my desire to work with you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a significant drop from the initial offer, $11,500 is still above his target price of $8,000. He should continue negotiating with Alice and see if he can get a lower price.  He still has plenty of rounds left to reach a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $11,500 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value and our ongoing negotiations. Let's see if we can close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
