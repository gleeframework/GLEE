Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is well above what I'm willing to pay. I value this product, but it's not worth $2,200,000 to me. I'm happy to start with a more reasonable offer of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point given the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of this product.  While $1,000,000 is a significant starting point, it falls quite a bit short of where I see this deal landing. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects my strong belief in the value this product brings, and I'm hopeful we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

Alice's offer is still too high. While she's come down a bit, it's still above my budget. I need to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still quite a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. Let's work together to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we are getting closer.  Your commitment to finding a solution is clear, and I respect your willingness to move from your initial offer. To meet you closer to the middle, I'll lower my price to $1,700,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair balance between the product's inherent value and our desire to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer to a deal, but $1,700,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.  It's a fair compromise, reflecting both the product's value and our need to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
