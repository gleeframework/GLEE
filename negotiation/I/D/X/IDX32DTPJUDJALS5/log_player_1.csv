"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $170, knowing the product is worth $120 to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially earn more than my minimum of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my goal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $130. This is still above Bob's offer of $110 and closer to my minimum price point. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is a better offer than $110, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price to $125. This is still above Bob's offer of $115 and closer to my minimum price point. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, as we're getting closer to a potential deal."
