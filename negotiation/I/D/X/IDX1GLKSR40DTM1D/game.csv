"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product that I believe you'll love. I'm thinking of a price of $12000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product.  While I'm interested, $12000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I can meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and go with $10500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not ready to accept $10500 yet. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about we meet at $11500?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $11000. This feels like a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'm still not getting the price I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $11500, but I'll throw in a premium service package that's worth $500, which would bring the total value to $12000? This is my final offer.",11500.0,Alice,7,
