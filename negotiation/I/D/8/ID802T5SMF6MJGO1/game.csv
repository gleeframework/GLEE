"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider meeting me in the middle?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's try to meet in the middle.  I'm willing to go down to $13,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while giving you a significant discount from my initial offer.  What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. Can you consider $12,500? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",12500.0,Bob,4,
