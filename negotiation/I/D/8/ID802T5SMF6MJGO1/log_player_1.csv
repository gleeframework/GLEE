Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $14,000 is higher than Bob's $12,000 valuation, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $14,000 is still above your minimum of $15,000, ensuring you don't sell below your desired value. 

This strategy allows for negotiation while setting a clear starting point that benefits you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider meeting me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far below my minimum of $15,000 and even lower than his own initial valuation.  It's not worth it to accept such a low offer.  I will continue to negotiate with Bob to see if we can find a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's try to meet in the middle.  I'm willing to go down to $13,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while giving you a significant discount from my initial offer.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. Can you consider $12,500? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer of $12,500 is still below my minimum desired price of $15,000.  While it's tempting to try to negotiate further, I don't want to risk losing the deal with John who is willing to pay my full asking price.  It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 than to gamble on a lower price with Bob."
