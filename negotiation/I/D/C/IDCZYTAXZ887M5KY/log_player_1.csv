Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts with a $1,000 markup, which is a reasonable starting point. It's high enough to give you potential profit, but not so high that it's immediately rejected.  I'm also including a positive message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and effort, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price, and I'm confident I can get a better deal.  It's worth continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer, but unfortunately, $8000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This still allows me some profit and demonstrates my willingness to work with you. Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $9500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9000. Would you be open to discussing this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $9,000 is close enough to my minimum that it's worth accepting.  It's a fair compromise, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether."
