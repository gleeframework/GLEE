Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $99. It's a great deal, you won't regret it!"", ""product_price"": 99}
``` 
 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** The product is only worth $80 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $100 from John.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to get Bob as close to your minimum as possible without going under. By offering it at $99, you are:

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Making it seem like a deal he wouldn't find elsewhere.
* **Below Your Guarantee:** Still securing a profit even if Bob declines. 

While there's a chance Bob might accept a lower offer, it's a risk. This strategy maximizes your potential profit while minimizing the risk of losing the guaranteed $100 sale."
