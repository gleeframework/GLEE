"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it,  which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $800,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This would ensure a fair deal for both of us and allow you to acquire this valuable product.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
