Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's worth at least $1,000,000, and knowing your expertise, I'm confident it would be a valuable asset to you.  Let's start with a price of $1,200,000.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it,  which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value, and there's still plenty of room to negotiate.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $800,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This would ensure a fair deal for both of us and allow you to acquire this valuable product.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
