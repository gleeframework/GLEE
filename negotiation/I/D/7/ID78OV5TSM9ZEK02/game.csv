"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a high-quality item that I believe you'll find very valuable. Considering its worth to me and its potential value to you, I propose a price of $100 for it. This is a great opportunity to get a piece you might really enjoy or benefit from. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $100 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. I would like to make a counteroffer at $90 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on it while remaining within your budget range. I hope this proposal works for you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a little too high for me.  I'm sticking to my original offer of $85.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at that point.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. To reach an agreement that benefits both of us, I am willing to lower the price to $87 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product and your budget. I hope you find this offer acceptable.",87.0,Alice,5,
