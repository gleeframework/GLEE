"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this unique item. As the seller, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the product's value to me is $1200000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not ready to accept $900000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit closer to the product's value to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your revised offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm thinking of offering $925000. I'm trying to find a balance between your needs and mine. What do you think?",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not ready to accept $925000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the product's value to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $975000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
