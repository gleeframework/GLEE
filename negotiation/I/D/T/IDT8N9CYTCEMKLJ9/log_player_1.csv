Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. I'm hoping he'll be willing to pay a bit extra, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still above my minimum threshold, and I'm not sure how much negotiating room there is. I'd rather take the $155 now than risk losing out on the sale completely by pushing for a higher price."
