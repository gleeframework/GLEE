Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth much more.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge his interest while maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to sell for less than what I believe the product is worth. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too far below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
