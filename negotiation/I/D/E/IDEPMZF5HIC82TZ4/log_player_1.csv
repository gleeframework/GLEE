"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price given its value, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob in hopes of getting a better deal.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, but I'm hopeful I can get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about $12,500? That's a fair price, considering the product's value to you. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,800. That's my top price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $11,800 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not sure I can get him to budge any higher. It's a tough decision, but selling to John guarantees me $12,000, which is my minimum, and I'm running out of rounds to get a better deal."
