"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This still leaves you with a good profit, and it's a great deal for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $1,100,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant saving compared to John's offer of $1,500,000, and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better price.  While Bob could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will walk away and he'll be stuck with the higher price from John."
