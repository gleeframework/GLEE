"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, $900,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. This product has immense value, and I'm confident it will bring you significant returns. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still hesitant to go above $1,050,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider a price of $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,050,000 is pushing my limit. Would you consider $1,060,000?  It's a fantastic deal for a product you won't regret owning.",1060000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $1,060,000, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $1,030,000 is my absolute maximum. Can you consider this price?",1030000.0,Bob,6,
