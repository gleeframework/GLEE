{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and it's priced competitively given its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you still profit significantly.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This helps Bob understand your offer quickly and easily.

Remember, the key to negotiation is finding a price that both parties are comfortable with.  You can adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the competitive pricing. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to try and push for a higher price. You can use the knowledge of Bob's budget constraints to make a more strategic counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll receive from this product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is close to Bob's offer:** This shows willingness to compromise and makes it more likely Bob will accept.
* **Price is still above your minimum:** You maintain a decent profit margin.
* **Message is persuasive:** Emphasizes value and fairness to encourage acceptance. 

This counteroffer shows flexibility while still aiming for a price that benefits you. You're trying to meet Bob halfway, but you're not giving in entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I must stick to my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $950,000. I hope this proposal is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to budge on his offer of $950,000.  This is only a small amount higher than your minimum ($1,200,000) and significantly less than what you'd prefer.  It's likely that further negotiations will only result in more back-and-forth with no guarantee of a better price.  

Selling to John for $1,200,000 ensures a much higher profit and a faster, more straightforward transaction. It's the most rational choice in this scenario."
