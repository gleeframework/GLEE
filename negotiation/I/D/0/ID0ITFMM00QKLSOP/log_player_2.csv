"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for a price that's fair for both of us. My offer is $100. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than what you are willing to pay. There's a good chance you can get a better price, either from Alice in a subsequent round or from John."
