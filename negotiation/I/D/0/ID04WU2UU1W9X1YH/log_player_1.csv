Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and slightly above what the product is worth to Bob ($1,200,000). This gives me some room to negotiate.
* By offering a higher price, I'm setting the tone for the negotiation and signaling my willingness to hold firm on my value.
* I'm aware that Bob could reject the offer, but I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement through negotiation. 
*  If Bob rejects the offer, I'll consider his counteroffer, but I'm prepared to walk away if it's too low.  I have John as a backup buyer, giving me negotiating power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price ($1,500,000) but still below it. 
* I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value.
* This approach keeps the negotiation open and allows me to try to get closer to my target price.
* I'm not going to sell to John yet as there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is still above Bob's offer of $1,400,000 but closer to his value and my minimum price of $1,500,000.
* This shows flexibility in the negotiation while still trying to get as close to my desired price as possible.
* The hope is that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer. 
*  However, I'm prepared to potentially reject another counteroffer if needed. I'm always aware of my backup option with John."

* I am going to reject his offer, as I'm confident I can get closer to my target price. 
* I believe we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement through continued negotiation.
* While John is a good backup option, I don't want to sell to him just yet.  I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

* This counteroffer of $1,550,000 is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price of $1,500,000. 
* It shows continued flexibility and a willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a fair price.
* I believe this is a strong offer that balances my needs with Bob's.
* This might be the final offer, but I am prepared to negotiate further if needed. However, I will not accept anything below my minimum price of $1,500,000.  
* I'm always mindful of John's offer, providing me with confidence during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $1,475,000 is still below my minimum price of $1,500,000.
*  We've gone back and forth a few times, and it's clear that Bob is not willing to meet my minimum price.
* I am going to sell to John for $1,500,000. It's the most I can get at this point, and it ensures I reach my minimum goal.

**Reasoning:**

While I would have liked to get closer to my ideal price, continuing the negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield better results. It's important to know when to cut losses and take the best offer available, especially when a reliable alternative buyer like John is readily available."
