"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $11,500 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm interested in purchasing, but would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than your initial estimate, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you placed on it in your initial message. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $11,500. I've been flexible, and I think this is the lowest price I can offer. If you're willing to meet me at $11,000, I'm willing to consider it, but I need to be honest with you, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at $11,000.",11500.0,Alice,7,
