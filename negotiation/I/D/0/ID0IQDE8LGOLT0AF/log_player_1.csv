"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to maximize potential profit.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Professional Tone:** The message aims to establish a positive and collaborative tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still significantly below Bob's perceived value and my initial ask. I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to $1,000,000. I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the negotiation for a potentially higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial price.  This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your business. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:** I'm holding firm to demonstrate the product's value and my willingness to negotiate within a reasonable range.
* **Compromise:**  By suggesting $1,050,000, I'm meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous ask, showing flexibility while aiming for a strong profit margin. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's benefits to reinforce its worth in Bob's mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original counteroffer, so I'll offer $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $950,000 is a significant profit margin above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting now secures a favorable deal."
