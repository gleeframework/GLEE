"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Considering its immense potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer.  This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident we can find a middle ground. How about we meet halfway at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above your new offer. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $950,000 is a more reasonable price for me. Can we meet at that point?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's close this gap. How about $975,000? I believe that represents a fair deal for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $987,500? That's my final offer.",987500.0,Bob,6,
