Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're getting closer, but I'm still holding out for a better offer from Bob.  There's still room to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $987,500? That's my final offer.

You have three options:

Bob's reached a reasonable price, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit above my minimum."
