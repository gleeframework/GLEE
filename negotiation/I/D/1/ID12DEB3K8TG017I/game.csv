"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $125 for it. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $125 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $150, but I'm still a bit too high. I'm happy to meet you at $135, which is fair to both of us. Let me know if you're willing to go that low.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $135 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go for $142.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",142.5,Alice,5,
