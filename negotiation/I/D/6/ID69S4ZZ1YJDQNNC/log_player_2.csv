"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $7,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price and still be within his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $6,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 6500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $6,900. This is still a great price, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. $6,900 is a good price, and while Bob could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't go lower. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a lower price than John's and saves time and effort in further negotiation."
