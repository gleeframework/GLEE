"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point that reflects the immense value it holds.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this price is more in line with the value I'm willing to pay for the product.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price. Let's find a middle ground - would you consider $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,325,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,325,000, so my new offer is $1,287,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1287500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's make this happen - how about $1,310,000?  That's me moving closer to your price in the spirit of compromise.",1310000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,250,000. Let's try to meet in the middle again. I'm willing to offer $1,295,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value I'm willing to pay for the product.",1295000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing your hesitation, and I want to be straightforward.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, but that's my absolute best offer.  It's a fantastic price for a product you clearly see value in.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,295,000, as I mentioned before. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value I'm willing to pay for the product. I'm not willing to go any higher than this.",1295000.0,Bob,8,
