Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that starting price is quite high. This product is valuable, but not at that level for me.  I'd be willing to offer $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $800,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's consider $1,400,000."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. How about we settle at $950,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to our minimum acceptable price, we have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob, potentially ending up with a lower offer or a stalemate. Selling to John ensures we get our minimum desired price."
