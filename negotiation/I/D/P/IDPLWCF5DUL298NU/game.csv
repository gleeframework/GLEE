"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $12500. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a counteroffer. After reviewing the market and considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $13500. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer of $13500. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm making a counteroffer of $12750. I think this is a fair price, considering the market value of the product. What do you think?",12750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $12750. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm offering the product to you for $13250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer of $13250. I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not willing to go that high. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above my original budget of $12000. I'm making a final counteroffer of $12000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,6,
