"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,000. I understand it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the effort.  How about we settle at $9,000? That would work well for me.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9,000. I'm still a bit above my minimum value of $12,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,5,
