Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for the price of $950,000.  This price reflects the product's significant value and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer price:**  $950,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation while still getting a good price.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product while framing the price as a fair deal. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I aim to secure the best possible price while also creating a sense of urgency for Bob. If he rejects my offer, I can then evaluate his counteroffer and make a calculated decision:
* **Accept a counteroffer:**  If his counteroffer is close to my desired price, I might accept it.
* **Reject and counteroffer:**  If his counteroffer is too low, I'll reject it and make a new counteroffer, potentially decreasing the price slightly to encourage him further.
* **Sell to John:**  If the negotiations stall, I have the option of selling to John for $800,000, ensuring I still make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price yet. I'll counteroffer and attempt to reach a mutually agreeable price that's closer to my initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down a little.  I'm happy to accept $900,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to you. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price of $900,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still a strong price for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and acknowledges Bob's perspective while emphasizing the fairness of my counteroffer. I also use language that encourages a positive outcome.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** Demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to settle for a low price.
* **Maintain leverage:** $900,000 is still a good price for me, and it leaves room for potential future negotiation.
* **Encourage acceptance:** The message is designed to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal, which might make him more likely to accept.

This approach balances my desire for a high price with the need to avoid a stalemate and the possibility of having to sell to John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from $900,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $875,000 is tempting, it's still a bit too far from my desired price. I'm not willing to settle for that amount yet. I'll counteroffer again, aiming to get closer to my target. 

**Strategy:**

I've learned that Bob is willing to compromise but is also very price-sensitive. I'll need to be strategic with my counteroffer to keep the negotiation going and secure a better price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $885,000, but I think that's the absolute maximum I can go. Please let me know if that's something you'd be willing to accept.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $885,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $887,500.  At this point, it's likely that we're both at our limits in terms of price.  I'm satisfied with this price as it's higher than John's offer and fairly close to my initial goal.  It's better to secure the deal now than to risk losing the sale to John or entering another round of negotiations that might not lead to a better outcome."
