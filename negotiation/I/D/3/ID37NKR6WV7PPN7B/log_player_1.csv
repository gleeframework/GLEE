Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very unlikely to move significantly higher than $700,000. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and he's made it clear that his budget is a major constraint.  Holding out for a slightly better offer from Bob carries the risk of him walking away entirely. Accepting John's offer guarantees the full $1,200,000 value, which is a significant improvement over the current trajectory with Bob."
