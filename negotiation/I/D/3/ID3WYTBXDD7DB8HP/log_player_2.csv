"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to spend no more than $8,000, and $13,000 is significantly above that.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You have 10 rounds, so you can try to get Alice to lower her price.
* **Option 3 is always available.**  If negotiation fails, you can always buy from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening:** I'm starting with my maximum price to see if Alice is willing to negotiate quickly. 
* **Setting a clear boundary:** This establishes that $8,000 is my absolute limit. 
* **It's a significant discount:** Alice values the product at $15,000, so this offer is a big drop, making her more likely to consider it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high.**  $11,000 is still outside my desired price range. 
* **There are still rounds left.** I have 7 rounds left, and Alice has moved slightly closer to my desired price.
* **Option 3 is a safety net.**  I can still buy from John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** I'm gradually increasing my offer, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Testing the waters:** This offer is closer to Alice's previous offer, testing if she's willing to meet me halfway.
* **Still leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not giving up on trying to get closer to my ideal price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting close to my target.** $10,000 is within a reasonable range of my maximum budget. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Accepting means I get the product, but at a slightly higher price. Rejecting means I risk further negotiation and possibly having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Time is a factor:** With 5 rounds left, continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or even a worse deal. 

This offer is a good compromise and likely the best outcome considering the remaining rounds and the alternative of buying from John."
