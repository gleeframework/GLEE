"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($15,000) but still significantly higher than Bob's estimated value ($8,000). 
* This initial offer sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for compromise. 
* By starting high, I aim to get a good starting point and see if Bob is willing to pay more than he initially thought."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $8,000 is far below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
*  I'm rejecting this offer to continue negotiating and try to get a better price.
* There are still 9 rounds left, and I want to explore if I can reach a compromise with Bob. 
* Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping for a more favorable outcome."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm lowering my offer to $11,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer of $8,000, but a compromise from my initial $13,000 offer. 
* This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate, but still holds a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for further negotiation. 
* I'm aiming to find a middle ground that satisfies both of us."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* While Bob's offer of $9,000 is an improvement, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* I'm willing to keep negotiating, hoping to get a better deal.
*  With 7 rounds remaining, I'm not yet at a point where selling to John for $15,000 seems like the best option.
*  My next counteroffer will aim to bridge the gap between our current positions."

* This offer is still higher than Bob's current offer of $9,000, but it's approaching the middle ground between our valuations. 
*  I'm hoping that this offer is attractive enough for Bob to consider, and we can finally reach an agreement."
