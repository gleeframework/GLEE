Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer than my original price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $12,000 for this exceptional product.  It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $11,500 is a good compromise and ensures a sale.  It's better than selling to John for $10,000, and we're getting closer to a deal with each round."
