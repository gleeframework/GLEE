"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000.  This price reflects its true potential and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another interested party ready to purchase it at a higher price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  While you can potentially negotiate with Alice further, it's more efficient to simply reject her offer and buy from John for a guaranteed price that fits your budget."
