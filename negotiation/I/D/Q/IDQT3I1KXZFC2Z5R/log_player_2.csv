"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This reflects the true value and potential it holds.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the $775,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm confident it can generate significant returns for you. I can go as low as $875,000.  This is my final offer.
