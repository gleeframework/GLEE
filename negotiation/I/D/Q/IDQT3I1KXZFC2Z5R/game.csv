"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This reflects the true value and potential it holds.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $950,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the $775,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm confident it can generate significant returns for you. I can go as low as $875,000.  This is my final offer.",875000.0,Alice,5,
