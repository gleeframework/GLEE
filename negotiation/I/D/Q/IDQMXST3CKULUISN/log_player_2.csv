"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I suggest we start our negotiation at $140. This price reflects the quality and utility of the product while allowing us to reach a fair agreement. Please let me know if this proposal works for you or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's starting price is too high. You know you can get the product for $150 from John, so there's no need to accept an offer above that. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create the opportunity for her to potentially lower the price in further negotiation."
