"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $8,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go lower than $9,000.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I think that's a fair price for the product.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one last concession.  $8,750 is my final offer.  This price is still fair considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good compromise.  What do you say?",8750.0,Alice,5,
