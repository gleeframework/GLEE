"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion. However, I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  That's still a great price for a product you'll really value.",130.0,Alice,3,
