``` 
 
This offer is a starting point that attempts to maximize profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  Here's why: 

* **Above Bob's Value:**  The price is higher than what Bob considers the product worth, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **Below Alice's Minimum:** The price is below Alice's minimum, ensuring she makes a profit. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  The offer allows for potential counteroffers and a negotiation process.  

Let me know how Bob responds and we can continue the negotiation!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I am looking to keep my spending within $10,000. Would you be able to lower the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting because it guarantees a sale, it's significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues the product for me.  

I'll counter Bob's offer with a higher price, aiming for a compromise that benefits both of us."
