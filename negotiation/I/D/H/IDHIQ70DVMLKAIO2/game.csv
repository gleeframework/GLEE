"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $10000 on this item. Would you consider accepting this offer?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $17000. This is the best I can do, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the value of the product, but I still believe we can come to an agreement within my budget. I would like to propose $15000 as the price for the product. I hope this is acceptable.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're getting closer to my target, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $18000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $16500. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",16500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $16000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $17000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $16500. This is my last offer, and if you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",16500.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but I'm still not convinced that $16250 is a fair price.
