"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a fair price. How does $90 sound?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is less than John's price, you know you can potentially get the product for a better price. Alice is clearly trying to make a profit, so there's room for negotiation."
