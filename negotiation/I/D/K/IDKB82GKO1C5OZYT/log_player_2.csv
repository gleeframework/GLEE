Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to let it go for $120. Would you like to make an offer or accept my price?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always a good idea to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since you're willing to pay up to $150, you have room to bargain with Alice.  Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a good starting point.  However, I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. Would you consider $100? "", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get it for a bit less, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going below that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $150 to me, and Alice has come down to $110. This is a good price, and I don't want to risk her getting frustrated and walking away.  Let's take it!"
