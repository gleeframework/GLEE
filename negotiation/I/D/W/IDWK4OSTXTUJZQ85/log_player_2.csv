"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly exceptional. Considering its value to you, I propose a price of $10,000 for this product. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I have room to negotiate down towards my $8,000 limit, especially knowing John offers a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value, but $10,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer ($6,000) leaves room for negotiation while signaling that the initial price is unrealistic for me.
* **Polite and Open:**  Maintaining a positive and respectful tone helps keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Justification:** I've hinted at my budget constraints without revealing my absolute limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to come up with a solution that works for both of us. Considering the value you place on the product, I propose a price of $7,500. This is higher than your offer but still lower than my initial proposal. I hope this is more in line with what you're looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, which is a good sign. However, her counteroffer is still closer to her desired price than mine. I'm still below my fallback price with John, so I'll push a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. $7,500 is closer, but it's still a stretch for me right now. How about we meet in the middle at $6,750?"",
""product_price"": 6750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $6,750, I'm proposing a compromise that splits the difference between our previous offers. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a lower price. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:** I want to keep the negotiation moving forward. Alice seems willing to come down, and this counteroffer keeps the pressure on without being overly aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see where you're coming from, Bob. I'd like to try to find a compromise that suits both of us. Considering your feedback, I propose a price of $7,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that respects the value you see in it while also being more reasonable for your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Alice has come down significantly, and $7,000 is a solid price, saving me $1,000 from her initial offer. 
* **Time is Money:**  We're past the halfway point in the negotiation. While I might be able to squeeze out a few hundred dollars more, it's not worth the risk of Alice raising her price or the deal falling through. 
* **Better Than John:** While John offers the product at $8,000, securing it for $7,000 from Alice is a better outcome."
