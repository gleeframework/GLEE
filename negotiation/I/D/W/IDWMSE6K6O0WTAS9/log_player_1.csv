Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, Alice. However, I'm looking to make a more reasonable offer. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this price still reflects the product's potential benefits to my business, but it's more aligned with my budget.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your desire to find a fair price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price you're asking. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your latest offer. How about we settle on $975,000? This would be a compromise that works for both of us.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're still not willing to budge, Alice, but I'm running out of room to negotiate. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but no higher. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. I hope we can find a mutually acceptable price.
