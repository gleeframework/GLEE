"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be highly beneficial to your business. I'm confident that this price reflects the product's true worth and potential.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, Alice. However, I'm looking to make a more reasonable offer. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this price still reflects the product's potential benefits to my business, but it's more aligned with my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. While I appreciate your interest, I'm hoping to find a price that reflects the true value of the product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would allow you to make a significant investment and for me to obtain a fair return.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to find a fair price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price you're asking. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your latest offer. How about we settle on $975,000? This would be a compromise that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $1,025,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing you to secure a valuable asset.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still not willing to budge, Alice, but I'm running out of room to negotiate. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but no higher. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. I hope we can find a mutually acceptable price.",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $990,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $1,005,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1005000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go above $990,000, Alice. I think that's already a generous offer considering the product's value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need you to meet me halfway. How about we settle on $997,500? This is the maximum I'm willing to pay.",997500.0,Bob,8,
