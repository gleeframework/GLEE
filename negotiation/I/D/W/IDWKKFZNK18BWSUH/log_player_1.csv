"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advisable to start negotiations with a price higher than your target. This allows room for negotiation and potentially secures a better deal.  
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer is intentionally ambitious. It serves to gauge Bob's level of interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Alternative Option:** The presence of John, offering the full value, provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably, Alice can walk away and accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to my maximum willingness to pay. How about $1,800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable range, Alice still has room to negotiate.  She knows the product is worth significantly more to her than John's offer, so there's no need to settle just yet.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Alice to counter with a price closer to her desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your initial offer is a bit low for the value this product offers, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet halfway at $1,900,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Alice acknowledges Bob's counteroffer and shows a willingness to compromise by reducing her initial price. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** By suggesting they meet halfway, Alice aims for a psychologically appealing point that might feel like a ""win"" for both parties.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** The price is still significantly higher than Bob's valuation and allows room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am still working within my budget. I would like to propose $1,750,000 as a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob's offer is improving, but the increments are relatively small. This suggests there's still room for negotiation.
* **Above John's Offer:**  Alice still has a standing offer from John that guarantees her $1,500,000. She's willing to push Bob a little further to try and get a better deal.
* **Strategic Rejection:** By rejecting this offer, Alice signals to Bob that she's serious about getting a price closer to her target. It might encourage him to make a more significant jump in his next offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $1,750,000 is cutting it a little too close to my bottom line. I could consider $1,850,000, but that's my best offer."", 
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** Alice sets a firm tone by stating this is her best offer. This signals to Bob that she's serious about the price.
* **Slight Concession:** By coming down $50,000, Alice demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise, but not at a significant cost to her target.
* **Justification:** Alice hints at her ""bottom line,"" subtly reinforcing that she's making a meaningful concession.
* **Time Pressure:** With five rounds remaining, Alice introduces a sense of urgency. This encourages Bob to move closer to her price to avoid missing out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget constraints, I would like to propose $1,800,000 as a final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:**  $1,800,000 is a solid offer, exceeding John's offer by a significant margin. 
* **""Final Offer"":**  Bob's language suggests this is likely his best price, and pushing further could risk losing the deal.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate risks stalling the deal with no guarantee of a better outcome. Accepting now secures a good price and avoids potential lost opportunities."
