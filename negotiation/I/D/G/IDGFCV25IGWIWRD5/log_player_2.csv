"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is within his budget, it's still higher than Alice's value of the product. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $12,000. Offering $13,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving some space for potential compromise.  It also shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $13,500, which is closer to Bob's desired price point.  While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice rejecting again or the negotiation dragging on increases.  Accepting this offer is a good compromise, ensuring Bob gets the product within his budget and doesn't have to resort to John's higher price."
