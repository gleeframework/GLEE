"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. Can you consider that?",18000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $20,000 represents the true value of the product, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $18,750? ",18750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $17,500 is cutting it a little too close to my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,125? This offer reflects my willingness to compromise while ensuring the product's value is recognized.",18125.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close.  While $17,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to accept it on the condition that we close the deal today. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",17000.0,Alice,7,
