Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'm hoping I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $150?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $135. Can you consider that?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $135 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough for me to feel comfortable selling. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $135 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $145 is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I'd like to make one more offer. How about we meet at $140? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob's offer of $140 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to earn.  With only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing out on a better deal.  John is offering a guaranteed $150, so I'm going to sell the product to him."
