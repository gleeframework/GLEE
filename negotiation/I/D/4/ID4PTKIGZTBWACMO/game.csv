"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This would be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to recover a significant portion of the product's value. Let's make this happen!",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,200 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to come to an agreement.  $9,200 is still too low for me, and I'm not sure we'll be able to close this deal. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time. I'll accept $9,300 for the product. This is my final offer.",9300.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to meet me in the middle, but $9,300 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,250 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9250.0,Bob,6,
