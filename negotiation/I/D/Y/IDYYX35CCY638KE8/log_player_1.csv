Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer you could send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so that's your fallback.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin to be made if you can negotiate effectively with Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high enough to capture a significant portion of the profit margin, but not so high that Bob walks away. 

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusive Opportunity:** Creates a sense of scarcity and value.
* **Unique Value Proposition:**  Subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth to him.
* **$1,150,000 Price:** This price gives Bob a $50,000 discount (making it attractive), while you secure a $150,000 profit above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach.  You can adjust the price and messaging based on your assessment of Bob's negotiating style (e.g., if he's known to be very price-sensitive, you might start a bit lower)."
