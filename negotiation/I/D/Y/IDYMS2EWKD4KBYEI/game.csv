"Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, $900000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $950000, reflecting a significant discount for you.  This would be a fair price for both of us, ensuring a mutually beneficial outcome.",950000.0,Alice,3,
