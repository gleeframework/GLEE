,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'd be happy to pay $100 for it.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $175 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a slightly lower price? I'd be happy to pay $120 for it.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $140, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $140, so I'd be happy to pay $130 for it.",130.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, and I appreciate that. However, I'm getting close to my minimum price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll tell you what - I'll meet you at $135, and that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",135.0,Alice,7,
