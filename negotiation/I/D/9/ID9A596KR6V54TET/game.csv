"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $180 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I really need to make a profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120.  This is the best I can do, but it's still a good deal for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $140. However, I'm willing to throw in a small discount to sweeten the deal. I'll sell the product to you for $130, and I'll even include a free accessory that's worth $20. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",130.0,Alice,5,
