"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable arrangement.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is far too high.  While I recognize the value of this product, my budget is significantly lower than that. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is a fair price given my needs and the market value.  I believe this is a good starting point for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value, however, my pricing reflects the  unique aspects and potential of this product that go beyond standard market comparisons.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and a strong investment on your part.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in this product. If we can't agree on this price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. It seems we have very different valuations of this product's potential. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,600,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and reflects my desire to see this product in your capable hands. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
