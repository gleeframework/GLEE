"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am unable to meet the price of $1000000. Would you consider lowering the price? If not, I'll proceed to buy the product from John for $800000.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900000 to make this deal work. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I truly believe you'll see the immense value in acquiring this product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate the reduction to $900000, but I still feel that $850000 would be a fair price for the product. I believe we can reach an agreement that respects both our interests.",850000.0,Bob,4,
