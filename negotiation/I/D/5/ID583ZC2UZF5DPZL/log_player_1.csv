"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $12,000, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below Bob's perceived value of $15,000, giving him room to negotiate, but also above my minimum value of $10,000, ensuring I still make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer meets my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter-offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit, how about $11,500?  It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you placed on it."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my desired price, and we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds. Accepting his offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of further rounds potentially leading to a lower price or even selling to John at a lower price."
