Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, but it's still a decent profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that price just yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135 as my counteroffer. This is still a good profit for me, but it's a compromise to show I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully get Bob to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good profit for me and higher than what John is offering. It seems Bob is firm on his price, so I'm happy to close the deal and move on."
