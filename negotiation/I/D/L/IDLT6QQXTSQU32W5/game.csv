"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I see in the product, and it's a significant discount from your initial offer. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I value your interest, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  This price still offers you a significant discount and allows me to secure a reasonable profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us!",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above the midpoint. How about we meet at $1,080,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1080000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,080,000 is still a little low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $1,115,000.  This price is within my acceptable range and allows you to secure a great deal.  Let's finalize this and move forward!",1115000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above $1,115,000. How about we meet at $1,090,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm getting closer to my maximum price, so I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1090000.0,Bob,6,
