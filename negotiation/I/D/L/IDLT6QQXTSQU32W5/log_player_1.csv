This offer is a good starting point. It is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I am hopeful that Bob will find this price attractive considering the value the product holds for him."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I see in the product, and it's a significant discount from your initial offer. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I believe the product is worth more than $1,100,000 to him and I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can reach a more favorable price.  I will counteroffer and try to meet in the middle."

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I still think we can reach a better agreement. I'm not ready to sell to John just yet. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can close the gap."
