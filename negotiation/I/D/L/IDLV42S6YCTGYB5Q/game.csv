"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $1,200,000.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $900,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,050,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to achieve a fair price for the product. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This price is fair for both of us, considering the product's value to you.  Let's try to close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 still isn't quite there for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 for this product, which is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
