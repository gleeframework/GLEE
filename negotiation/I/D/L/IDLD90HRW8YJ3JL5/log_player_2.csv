Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $11,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? It's a fair price that considers both our perspectives.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
