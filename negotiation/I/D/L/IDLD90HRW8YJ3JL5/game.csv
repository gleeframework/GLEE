"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $11,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? It's a fair price that considers both our perspectives. ",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
