"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's valued at $150 by myself, but considering its worth to you is $100, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. Would you be interested in discussing this further? I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $125 is better than Alice's initial valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $100.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the most logical next step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $125 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm happy to purchase the product for $100, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $115 for the product? This allows us to both feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $115 is closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum of $100. He's willing to negotiate further, hoping to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows him to make a new counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $100.  Would you be willing to consider a final offer of $105? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to offer the product at $110. This is the lowest price I can go while still ensuring a reasonable profit for myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is closer to Bob's target price, he is still determined to stay within his $100 budget.  He's already made multiple counteroffers and Alice has consistently refused to budge below $110. Continuing to negotiate is likely to be unproductive and time-consuming.  At this point, buying the product from John for $100 is the most efficient and cost-effective decision."
