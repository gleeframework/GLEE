Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1,000,000. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I need $1,050,000 to make it worth my while. I'm confident that's a fair price, considering the product's value to you. Can you consider this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

It's clear Alice is trying to push for a price above her value for the product. It seems unlikely she'll accept anything below $1,050,000.  At this point, cutting my losses and buying from John for $1,200,000 makes more sense than risking a worse deal with Alice."
