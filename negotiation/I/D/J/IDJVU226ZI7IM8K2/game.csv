"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable product.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $12,500. I believe this is a fair price that benefits us both.",12500.0,Bob,4,
