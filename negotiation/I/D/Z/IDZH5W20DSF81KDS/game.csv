"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that you're still not satisfied with the price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a good compromise, considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
