"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe is worth every penny of its $100 value to you. Considering its exceptional quality and benefits, I'm extending this opportunity to purchase it at a special introductory price of $95. This is an exclusive offer tailored specifically for you, aiming to provide you with the best value for your investment. Don't miss out on this chance to experience the true worth of our product. Let me know if you have any questions or if you're ready to proceed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $95 is lower than John's price of $100, it's still significantly higher than your $100 limit and Alice's own valuation of $80. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal."
