Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, and also shows Bob I'm serious about selling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $120 is too low for me, and I'm confident that I can get a better price, especially since John is willing to pay $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price to $140, which is still higher than what Bob offered but closer to his price point. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, while still leaving me room to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his offer of $125 is still too low for me. I'm confident that John will buy the product for $150, which is closer to my desired price.  It's better to secure a higher price, even if it means selling to someone else."
