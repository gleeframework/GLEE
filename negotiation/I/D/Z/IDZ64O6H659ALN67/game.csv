"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it hard to resist this offer. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $950,000 is slightly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm going to counter with an offer of $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it hard to resist this revised offer. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $900,000 is still a little high for me. However, I'm committed to making this work. I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair price, considering its value to me and allows you to get a good return. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into creating it. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875,000 and $925,000. I'll counter with an offer of $900,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",900500.0,Alice,5,
