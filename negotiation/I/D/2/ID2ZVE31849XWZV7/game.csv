"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a little high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Could we meet somewhere around $725,000? I believe that's a reasonable compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $725,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from my initial asking price.  To bridge this, let's settle at $875,000. This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would $800,000 work for you?",800000.0,Bob,6,
