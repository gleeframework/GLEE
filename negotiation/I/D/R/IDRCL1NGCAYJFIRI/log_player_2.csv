"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $100. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is less than Alice's value, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and gives you a chance to get a better price from Alice or proceed with your backup plan."
