"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price slightly above the product's worth to Bob ($850,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value Bob will get from the product. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message also implies a willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to respond. 

**Remember:** This is just the first offer. Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $750,000 is still a good price, it's below my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. I have 10 rounds to work with, and I believe I can get closer to my target price.  

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my original offer, aiming to find a compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While I can't go as low as $750,000, I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This price still represents a great value for you, considering the product's potential. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer ($850,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($750,000).  
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that even at $825,000, the product offers significant value.
* **Positive and Collaborative Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone and focusing on finding a solution that works for both of us.

This counteroffer demonstrates my flexibility while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $775,000 is getting closer to my target, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $800,000.  I have 6 rounds left, and I believe I can still get a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price that's closer to my goal, aiming for a compromise that's beneficial for both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $775,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $800,000, which is my absolute minimum.

```

**Explanation:**
