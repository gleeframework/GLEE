,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. Let's close this deal! ",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $107 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",107.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a mutually agreeable price. While $107 is closer, I'm still not comfortable with that figure. How about we split the difference and go with $108? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. ",108.0,Alice,5,
