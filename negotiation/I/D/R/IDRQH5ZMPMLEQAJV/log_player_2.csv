"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's not worth it to buy the product from Alice for $150 when you can get it from John for $120.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm offering $110, which is still below my maximum but significantly less than Alice's initial offer. This should start the negotiation and give Alice an incentive to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my maximum.  I'll continue to negotiate and hope to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $115, showing flexibility while staying below my maximum.  This might be enough to convince Alice to accept, as it's getting closer to her desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $130 is getting closer to my maximum, I'm still hoping to negotiate a lower price. I'll continue to bargain and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

I'm finally offering my maximum price of $120.  This is a fair price for both of us, and hopefully, Alice will accept. If she doesn't, I'll buy from John."
