You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $95.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90. That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

You are still better off than buying from John, but you can likely get it for a little less. Continue negotiating to see if you can get closer to your target price."
