"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its value to you and allows me to earn a healthy profit.  What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get a better deal considering the product's value to me is $12,000.",10800.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $10,800 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $11,200? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to earn a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $11,000? That's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
