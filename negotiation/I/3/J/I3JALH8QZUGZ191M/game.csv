"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm confident it holds equal value for your business. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000, which reflects its inherent worth. I'm open to negotiating, so let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering it's still worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 doesn't quite cover the value of this product for me. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still leaves room for you to gain significant value, and it ensures I don't have to take a significant loss.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and go with $975,000?  This allows us both to make a fair deal and move forward.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $975,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to gain something from this deal.  What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
