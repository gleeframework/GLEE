Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I still have time to negotiate and I'm not desperate to sell yet."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $110. This still leaves some room for both of us to get a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $102.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I have a few more rounds to negotiate and can still potentially get a better deal.  Selling to John is always an option, but I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $102.50 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer the product for $107.50. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

This time, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still not my ideal price, we're getting close to the end of the rounds and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale altogether."
