{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower offer of $900,000. This is still a good deal for Alice as it's well above her desired price, and it gives me some room to negotiate further if needed."

While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, I'm still not willing to accept. I believe I can get a price closer to my target of $900,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before I consider buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm going to offer $950,000. This is a compromise, but still a good deal for me. If Alice rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider buying from John."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm running out of time and rounds. I'm not willing to risk another round of negotiation and risk getting stuck with a higher price.  Buying from John at $1,200,000 is still a good deal for me, and I'm confident I can make a profit."
