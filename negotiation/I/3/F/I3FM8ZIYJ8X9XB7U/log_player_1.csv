"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $120 to you, so I'm offering it to you at a price of $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's still attractive to Bob, but gives me a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Fairness:** I'm acknowledging the product's value to Bob, making the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using language that suggests I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to counteroffer if he's not happy with the initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:**  My goal is to maximize profit, and $90 is still below my desired minimum of $80. 
* **Counteroffer Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price in the next round.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is a safety net, I'm not desperate to sell immediately and believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $95? This gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Suggesting a ""middle ground"" price reinforces the idea of fairness and makes the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Maintain Profit:** $95 is still above my minimum price and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $92. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** $92 is very close to my desired minimum of $80, and it's a significant improvement over Bob's previous offer.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 6 rounds left, accepting the offer ensures I get a decent profit without risking going lower or getting stuck with John's lower offer.
* **Negotiation Exhausted:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and it's likely that continuing the negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price."
