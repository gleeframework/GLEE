Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. My asking price is $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I need ($150) to see if I can get closer to my desired profit margin.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message can help build rapport and make Bob more open to negotiating.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The price leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation alive. 

I'm confident that I can get at least $150 from John, but I'm hoping to get more from Bob. This offer gives me a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but my budget allows me to spend no more than $100 on this item. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for a loss.  

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:**  I need to hold firm on my minimum price and reject his offer. 
* **Moving to a Counteroffer:** I'm confident I can get a better price by making a counteroffer. I'll aim for a price closer to my desired $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints.  While I can't go as low as $100, I'm willing to come down to $125 to make this work. This would still allow me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price, showing Bob I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Motivating Factor:**  The message highlights that $125 is still a fair profit for me, suggesting that I'm not likely to go lower.
* **Open to Further Discussion:**  The ""What do you think?"" ending invites Bob to counter again, allowing the negotiation to continue. 

This counteroffer strikes a balance between staying true to my minimum price and keeping the negotiation moving."
