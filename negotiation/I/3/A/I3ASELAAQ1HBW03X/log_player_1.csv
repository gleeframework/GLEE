Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I think it would be particularly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can decide if you want to settle closer to $15,000.
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob specifically might make him more amenable to a higher price. 

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob will reject a higher price. However, this strategy gives you the best chance to maximize your profit."
