"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This reflects its worth while recognizing your initial investment.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still thinking $1,200,000 is a fair price. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I have in mind, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000. I believe this reflects the product's value and avoids prolonging the negotiation.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,275,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,275,000, so how about $1,262,500?",1262500.0,Bob,6,
