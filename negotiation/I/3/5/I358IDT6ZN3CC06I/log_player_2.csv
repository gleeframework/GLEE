"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $11,500. I think this is a great deal considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before going to John.  I'm hoping we can get closer to my price range with a final counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and agree on $10,750?  It's closer to what I can afford and still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,750 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to make one more counteroffer. I can offer the product to you for $11,200. It's still a good deal for me, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $11,200 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. I've made multiple counteroffers, and it seems like we're not going to be able to agree on a price.  At this point, it's better to just buy the product from John for $10,000 and avoid further negotiation."
