Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies there's competition (""interest I've had"") to nudge Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the price is above Bob's perceived value, it leaves space for potential counter-offers and still ensures you get a good deal. 

**Important:** This is just an opening move.  Be prepared to negotiate based on Bob's response."
