"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is above Bob's maximum price point of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, so he's offering a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer. This counteroffer is still below Bob's maximum price point, but it leaves room for negotiation.  It also shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product, but he's not willing to pay her asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget concerns, but $11,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above Bob's maximum price point of $12,000. While it is closer to Bob's desired price, he can potentially negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $12,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,000? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now at his maximum price point of $12,000.  This offer is a compromise that is likely to be attractive to Alice, as it's closer to her desired price than Bob's previous offer.  By stating that it's his ""final offer"", Bob is signaling to Alice that he's serious about buying the product at this price, but he's not willing to go higher."
