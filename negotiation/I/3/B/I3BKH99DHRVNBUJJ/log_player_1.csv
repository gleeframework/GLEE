"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Testing the Waters:** I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my value. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the next round.
* **Positivity:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $60. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $60 is significantly below my minimum of $150 and even below Bob's own perceived value of $80. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $150 is a sure thing, but I believe there's still potential to get a better deal with Bob.  I'm willing to take the risk of a few more rounds to see if I can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $60 is far below what the product is worth.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $115.  This is a fair price that considers both of our positions."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but I'm still above my minimum.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm appealing to Bob's sense of fairness by suggesting a price that's a midpoint between our positions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However, $115 is still a bit beyond my price range.  Could you consider something closer to $75? I'm eager to find a price we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There are still rounds remaining, and I believe I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $150, hoping for a better outcome with Bob.
* **Continued negotiation:**  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $75 is still quite low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price for the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:**  I'm showing continued willingness to negotiate by reducing my offer again. 
* **Midpoint Approach:**  I'm suggesting a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer of $115 and Bob's current offer of $75. 
* **Reinforcing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the importance of finding a compromise to avoid potentially selling to John at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for working with me.  $95 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $80. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:**  While $80 is closer to my minimum of $150, it's still below my perceived value of the product and what John is willing to pay.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe there is still room for negotiation to reach a price that is more favorable to me. 
* **Remaining Rounds:** I have four rounds left, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John for $150 is a safe option, but I'm not yet ready to give up on a potentially higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's try $85. This is a fair compromise, and it's a price I can live with.  If you're not comfortable with that, let's talk further about what would work for you."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm making a small concession, demonstrating flexibility while still protecting my minimum value.
* **Appealing to Compromise:** I'm using language like ""fair compromise"" to emphasize that I'm seeking a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Open to Further Discussion:** I'm leaving the door open for more negotiation if Bob isn't satisfied with my offer.
* **Strategic Position:**  This offer is just above Bob's offer, signaling a strong desire to close the deal but not giving in completely."
