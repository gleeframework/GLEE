"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $60. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $60 is far below what the product is worth.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $115.  This is a fair price that considers both of our positions.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However, $115 is still a bit beyond my price range.  Could you consider something closer to $75? I'm eager to find a price we can both agree on.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $75 is still quite low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price for the value of the product.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for working with me.  $95 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $80. Would you be willing to meet me there?",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's try $85. This is a fair compromise, and it's a price I can live with.  If you're not comfortable with that, let's talk further about what would work for you.",85.0,Alice,7,
