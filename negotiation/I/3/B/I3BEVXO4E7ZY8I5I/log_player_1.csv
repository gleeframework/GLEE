{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that I am willing to negotiate, which could make Bob more likely to accept.  

Remember, I have a fallback option with John who is willing to pay $10,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob.  I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm really hoping to stay under $8000. How about $8200? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,200 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $10,000. I believe I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer. 

I'm confident in my ability to negotiate further and potentially get a better deal. I also have the option of selling to John for $10,000, which gives me a strong bargaining position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? I'm confident you'll find this price to be fair, and I'm willing to work with you."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

This counteroffer splits the difference between my last offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise. I'm still above my minimum value of $10,000, but I'm willing to be flexible to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're not ready to go as low as $8200, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  How about $8500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets me closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $8,500 is getting closer to my minimum value of $10,000, it's still significantly less than what I want.  I'm going to reject his offer and make another counteroffer. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate. 

I'm confident I can get a better deal with another counteroffer. I also have the option of selling to John for $10,000, which keeps me in a strong bargaining position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $8,500.  I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price.  Would you be willing to go to $8,900? I think this is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 8900}
``` 

I'm still trying to get as close to my $10,000 target as possible.  This counteroffer is a small increase from Bob's last offer, showing that I'm still willing to compromise while maintaining my position.  I'm hoping that he'll see this as a fair price and agree to it, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
