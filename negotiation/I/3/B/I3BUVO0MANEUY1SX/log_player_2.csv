Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Wait, I think I made a mistake. I meant to send a counteroffer, not just reject her offer. Since I'm not willing to pay $10,000, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's still lower than that. Here it is:

{""message"": ""I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit below $10,000. How about we meet at $9,200?"", ""product_price"": 9200}"
