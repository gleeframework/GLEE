Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I know will be incredibly valuable to your business. My asking price is $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and its potential for significant returns.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a decent offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price point. By rejecting and sending a counteroffer, I can keep the negotiation going and potentially get a better deal.  It's also important to remember that I have 10 rounds, so there's still time to work out a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for your business.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. I'm proposing $900,000, which still allows for a significant profit for you. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our needs. Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $875,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the profit you'll still make. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm willing to keep negotiating, especially since I have 6 rounds left. I think there's still room for a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your persistence in finding a price that works for both of us.  While $875,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $900,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $887,500? This would be a fair price that acknowledges the product's value and allows for a substantial profit for both of us. Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 887500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire to reach a price closer to $900,000, but I'm still not comfortable with $887,500.  To show my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to offer $880,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a significant profit for you.  Let's find common ground and make this deal happen.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $880,000 is very close to my desired price and the negotiation is going well. It's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk losing the deal.  It's a good compromise that ensures a substantial profit for me, and I'm confident this is the best deal I can get with Bob."
