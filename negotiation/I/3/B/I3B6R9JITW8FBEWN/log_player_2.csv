"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I know will be incredibly valuable to your business. My asking price is $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and its potential for significant returns.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good deal for Alice, it's still above your target of $1,000,000.  It's worth negotiating further to try and get a better price.  There are still 9 rounds to go, and you have the safety net of buying from John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for your business.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. I'm proposing $900,000, which still allows for a significant profit for you. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our needs. Let's see if we can find a common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $900,000, it's still above your target price. You can continue to negotiate, hoping to get a better price. You have 7 rounds left, and the option to buy from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $875,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the profit you'll still make. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your persistence in finding a price that works for both of us.  While $875,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $900,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $887,500? This would be a fair price that acknowledges the product's value and allows for a substantial profit for both of us. Let's close this deal now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $887,500 is closer to your target price, it's still slightly above your comfort zone. You have 5 rounds left and can continue negotiating for a lower price. It's worth pushing for a bit lower to see if you can get closer to $875,000. You also have the safety net of buying from John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire to reach a price closer to $900,000, but I'm still not comfortable with $887,500.  To show my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to offer $880,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a significant profit for you.  Let's find common ground and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 880000}
