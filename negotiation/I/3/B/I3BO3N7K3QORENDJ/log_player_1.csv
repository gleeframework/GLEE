"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob doesn't accept. It's also a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, so I'm starting strong.  I'm curious to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet.  I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $15,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. Even though it's my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's a chance to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm dropping my offer again to $14,000.  It's a significant compromise, but I'm hoping Bob will finally accept.  I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, but I still want to get the best deal possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has finally moved from his initial $12,000 offer. While it's still not my ideal price, $12,600 is close enough to my minimum and it's getting late in the negotiation rounds. I'm accepting his offer to avoid potentially losing out on the deal altogether."
