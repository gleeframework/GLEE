Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leverage his interest and potentially negotiate a higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The price is below my minimum value but allows for some room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the conversation. 
* **Next Steps:**  If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly, keeping in mind my minimum value and the possibility of selling to John as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,250,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which is a fair price given its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value:**  While it's tempting to accept his offer, I'm committed to earning at least $1,500,000 for the product.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate.  There's potential to reach a mutually agreeable price somewhere between his offer and my minimum.
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting his offer, I can gauge how serious he is about buying the product.  If he's truly interested, he'll likely counter again.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum value but still leaves room for some give and take. I'll also be mindful of my fallback option (selling to John) if the negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum value.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** The message emphasizes a fair deal for both parties, encouraging Bob to consider the value he'll receive from the product.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  By staying firm on my minimum value, I aim to keep the negotiation moving towards a favorable outcome for me.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** I'll be prepared to analyze Bob's next move and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects again, I'll consider how close he is to my minimum value and if I should still try to negotiate further.
* **John's Offer:**  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob break down."
