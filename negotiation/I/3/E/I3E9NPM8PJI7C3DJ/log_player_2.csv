Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, though. I'll offer it to you for $775,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going below $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, though. How about we try $762,500? This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $762,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $762,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice is very close to her minimum price. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and continuing to negotiate might make her less willing to compromise. Accepting the $762,500 offer is a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity to buy the product below your maximum budget."
