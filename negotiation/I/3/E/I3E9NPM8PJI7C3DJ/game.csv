"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. This product aligns with my needs, but the price point is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has immense value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that I think will benefit both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While the product is valuable, $825,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we settle at $725,000? I think that's a fair offer considering its worth to both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, though. I'll offer it to you for $775,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",775000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer. I'm willing to come up a little bit. How about we split the difference and make it $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going below $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, though. How about we try $762,500? This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",762500.0,Alice,7,
