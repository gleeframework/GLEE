"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $105? ",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob! I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $105. I'm thinking of a price of $108. It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're trying to be flexible, but $108 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping we can find a way to close this deal. How about we settle on $102? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to purchase the product without going over my budget.",102.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $102 just yet. I'm thinking of a price of $107. It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. What do you think?",107.0,Alice,7,
