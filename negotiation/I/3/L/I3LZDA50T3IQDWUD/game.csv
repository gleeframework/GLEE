"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm interested in your product but I can only offer $12,000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $12,000 is not quite where I need to be, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $16,000? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $16,000 is still a bit out of my range. Would you consider $14,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this transaction.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to drop my price to $15,000, which is my absolute minimum. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're able to accept this offer. ",15000.0,Alice,5,
