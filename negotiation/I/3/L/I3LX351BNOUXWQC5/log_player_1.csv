Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Justification for the price:**  The message subtly implies the product's value might be even higher than Bob's perceived $800,000 valuation.
* **Room for negotiation:**  The tone leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially still landing a sale well above your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of John's offer.  Revealing your backup plan could weaken your position."
