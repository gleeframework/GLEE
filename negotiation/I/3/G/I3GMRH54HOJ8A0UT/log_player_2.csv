Bob should continue to negotiate and reject Alice's offer.  He can likely get a better price than $11,000 by continuing to counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a good deal for you compared to the $15,000 you'd pay if you were to buy it elsewhere.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  Although he'd prefer a lower price, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price.  A $11,500 price point is still a good deal for Bob compared to John's offer, and it's worth finalizing the transaction."
