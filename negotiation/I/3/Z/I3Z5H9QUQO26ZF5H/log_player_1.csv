Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making that your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Potential Profit:**  There's a potential profit of $200,000 if you can sell to Bob above his valuation.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob while still netting you a significant gain. We want to avoid being too greedy and risking Bob rejecting the offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Considering its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $850,000. I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair deal."" 
* **Price Point:** $850,000 is $50,000 above Bob's valuation, but significantly below your guaranteed offer. This gives Bob a strong incentive to accept while still netting you a $50,000 profit over your alternative.

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no information about Bob's financial situation or negotiation tactics beyond his valuation of the product."
