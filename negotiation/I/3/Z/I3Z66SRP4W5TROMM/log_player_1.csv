Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me a good margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob. I'm confident that I can get a higher price than $150, but I'm also aware that I need to be flexible and willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $160 is better than my floor price of $150, I believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to try to counter and see if I can push him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm going to counter with $180. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I'm hoping it will be appealing enough for him to accept. I'm still confident that I can get a higher price, but I want to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $170. While I was hoping for a bit more, $170 is a good price and it's getting close to my desired range. I'm also aware that continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or him walking away, which would mean selling to John for a lower price."
