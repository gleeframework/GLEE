"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd love! I'm offering it to you for $140.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  $140 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Emphasis on value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob (""fantastic"", ""you'd love"", ""very valuable"") can increase his willingness to pay a higher price.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message indicates a willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel more comfortable engaging in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could you consider reducing the price to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:**  While $130 is closer to my minimum of $120, it's still above it. This gives me room to negotiate further.
* **Potential for a higher price:**  Bob clearly values the product and is willing to negotiate. I believe I can push for a higher price by counter-offering.
* **Limited rounds:**  With only 10 rounds, I want to maximize my chances of getting a better price than $130. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter-offer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above $130.  I'll aim for a price that is attractive to Bob while still allowing me to make a good profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is still a great price for a product you'll value highly."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Meeting Bob halfway at $135 shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I reiterate the product's value to Bob to remind him of its worth.
* **Still Profitable:**  $135 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, ensuring I make a profit.

**Strategy:**

By offering $135, I aim to strike a balance between a price that is attractive to Bob and a price that allows me to maintain a decent profit margin.  I'm also hoping that this counter-offer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, avoiding further rounds of negotiation."
