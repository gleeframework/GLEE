"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $115. It's a fantastic deal for you as it's worth at least $120 to you!  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $115 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $120 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her or simply proceed to buy from John and save $5."
