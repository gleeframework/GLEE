Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a fantastic deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message emphasizes the ""fantastic deal"" for both parties, making it more likely for Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By starting at a price that is higher than my minimum, I have the flexibility to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer. If the negotiation becomes unproductive, I'll end the negotiations and sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob's counteroffer is higher than his initial value, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob or even John, as I have a guaranteed alternative with John.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to bridge the gap between his offer and my minimum acceptable price. I'll consider factors like:

* **Bob's willingness to negotiate:** If Bob is willing to compromise, I'll aim for a higher price. 
* **Time constraints:** If I feel pressured to sell quickly, I might accept a lower price, but I'll still try to get as close to my minimum as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits everyone."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer of $1,150,000 is a compromise between Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the product's value to reiterate its worth.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains positive and collaborative, fostering a sense of cooperation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. Depending on his reaction, I might:

* **Accept his counteroffer:**  If he comes closer to my target price.
* **Make a final counteroffer:** If he's still too far off, but there's potential for a deal.
* **Sell to John:**  If the negotiation stalls or his counteroffer is unacceptable, I'll move forward with John."
