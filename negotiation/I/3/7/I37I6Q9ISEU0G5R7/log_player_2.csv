"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a fantastic deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal for Alice, it's still too high for Bob. He can get the same product from John for a lower price.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits everyone. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Better than John:**  Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still better than buying from John for $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While it's a good deal for Alice, it's a good price for Bob and is within his budget. He could potentially negotiate further, but there's a risk of Alice rejecting further offers and potentially losing the deal altogether. 

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing out on the product."
