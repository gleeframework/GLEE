Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm open to negotiating a bit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm starting with my desired price, but acknowledging that I'm open to negotiation. This should start a conversation with Bob and allow me to gauge his interest and potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to pay $120, which is still a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference.  I'll offer you $130. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's within my budget.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $130 is still lower than my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting Bob's offer will ensure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John at a lower price."
