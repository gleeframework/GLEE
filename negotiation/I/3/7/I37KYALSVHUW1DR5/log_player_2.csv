"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm open to negotiating a bit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. It's above your maximum budget of $120.  It makes sense to reject and start negotiating."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum price point. It's worth rejecting this offer and trying to get it closer to $120. You can still buy from John for that price if the negotiation fails."
