I'm not willing to accept $130 yet. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer.  I'll counter with a lower price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132

``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $132.  It's a good price, and I'm starting to run out of time.  I'm not sure how many more rounds we have before I need to sell to John."
