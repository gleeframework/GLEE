"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $20,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to pay $15,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $17,500.",17500.0,Alice,3,
