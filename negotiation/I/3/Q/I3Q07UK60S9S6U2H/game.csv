"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make $9,500 to make it worth my while. Would you be willing to go up to that price?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle on $9,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,000. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $9,250? It's a compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to move up a little bit. How about $9,100?",9100.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $9,100, but I need to make a bit more to make it worth my while. How about we try $9,200? It's just a small increment, but it's a fair price for the value you'll be getting.",9200.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting close to my minimum, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $9,150. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I need to make a decent profit. How about we try $9,250? It's a small increase, but it's worth it for the value you'll be getting.",9250.0,Alice,9,
