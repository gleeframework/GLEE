"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's significantly less than its worth to you. Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer ready to purchase at a lower price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is less than the $1,500,000 John is asking.
* **You save money:**  Accepting Alice's offer saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John.

Even though Alice's offer might be slightly higher than the product's value to her, it's still the most financially advantageous option for you."
