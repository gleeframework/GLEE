Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $100 is higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($80), giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $100 is still above your minimum of $120, so you're already making a profit. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, you can lower the price slightly, while still making a decent profit.

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. That's the price I'm willing to pay 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with this product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering $95. This is still above Bob's perceived value, but it's a significant step closer to my minimum acceptable price.  It demonstrates that I'm open to negotiation, but also that I'm not willing to sell for a price that doesn't make sense for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $92.50 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.  There's a good chance that Bob might not budge further, and I don't want to risk losing this sale and having to sell to John at $120. I'll accept Bob's offer."
