{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, and at $1,450,000 it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I might be able to push him slightly higher, it's not worth the risk of him walking away. I can secure my minimum acceptable price with John."
