"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $8,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is way too high. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000} 
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer. It's a bold move, but it reflects Bob's firm understanding of the product's value and sets a clear expectation for future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget, but it's getting closer. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, potentially leading to a better deal in the future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500} 
``` 

Bob is getting closer to his target price, and this counteroffer shows Alice that he's serious about negotiating. By offering a price slightly above his maximum, Bob leaves room for potential compromise in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still slightly higher.  It's worth seeing if Bob can get an even better price by continuing to negotiate.  There are still several rounds left, and a bit of persistence might lead to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

This counteroffer is Bob's final stand.  He's offering his absolute maximum, and if Alice rejects it, he'll go to John.  By offering the full $8,000, there's no room for further negotiation, putting pressure on Alice to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is only $200 below Bob's maximum, and he's already stated his price limit.  There's no reason to accept now, especially since there are still a few rounds left.  The goal is to see if Alice will come down further or if Bob should buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

Bob sticks to his maximum price point. There's no need to lower his offer again, as he can always go to John. This move puts the pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the deal entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is now just $100 above Bob's maximum budget. With only one round left, it's reasonable to accept. There's a good chance that if Bob rejects and makes a counteroffer, Alice might reject it, forcing Bob to buy from John."
