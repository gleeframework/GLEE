Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a great starting point, but I'm looking to invest in this product at a lower price point. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, reflecting its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has incredible potential, and I'm confident in its value. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  While $900,000 is closer, I believe $875,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. It's a significant move from my last offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us. Accepting $875,000 now would leave potential profit on the table.  We'll counter with a price closer to $900,000 to test his flexibility."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we are getting closer.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me at $890,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm prepared to go to $880,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, and I'm hopeful it demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and this offer is a solid profit. Accepting $880,000 secures the deal now and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
