"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $9,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,250. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $8,250 is closer to what you're looking for, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line.  I'm willing to accept $8,750, but that's my absolute final offer.  It's a fair deal considering the value this product brings.",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $8,750 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to pay up to $8,500, and I think that's a fair price considering the value it brings to me. I'm hoping we can meet on this price.",8500.0,Bob,6,
