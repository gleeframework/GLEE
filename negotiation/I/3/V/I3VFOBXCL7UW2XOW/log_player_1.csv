Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's in excellent condition and would be a great asset to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You want to maximize your profit, but you also want to keep Bob engaged.
* **It's significantly lower than Bob's value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving you a significant profit.
* **The message is friendly and encouraging:** This sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 

Remember, the goal is to find a price that both you and Bob are happy with!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a decent profit, it's still significantly lower than what Bob is willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price, keeping in mind that you can always accept John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit higher.  How about $11,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet Bob halfway:** This shows you're willing to compromise, but also keeps the price above your minimum.
* **Emphasize the value:**  Reminding Bob of the great deal he's getting helps maintain his interest.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  There's still a bit of wiggle room if Bob wants to counter again."
