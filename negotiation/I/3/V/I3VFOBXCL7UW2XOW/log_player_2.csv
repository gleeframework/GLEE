"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000.  It's in excellent condition and would be a great asset to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better price than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit higher.  How about $11000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $11,000:** This is still a good deal for Bob, as he's willing to pay up to $15,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this offer and makes a counteroffer, there's a chance Alice will reject it again. This could lead to a stalemate, forcing Bob to buy from John at the higher price. 
* **Time and effort:** Continued negotiation takes time and effort, which may not be worth it for a potential saving of only $4,000.

Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a price that's significantly lower than John's."
