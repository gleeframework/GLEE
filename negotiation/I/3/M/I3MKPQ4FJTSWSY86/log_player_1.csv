Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a good profit.  I'm also keeping in mind John's offer as a safety net, so I won't be afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. How about $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is too far off. I will counteroffer to keep the negotiation going and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is too far below my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This price still allows me to make a profit while being fair to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15500} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate. $15,500 is still a good profit for me and hopefully closer to a price that Bob is willing to pay.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $14,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price and still allows me to make a profit. It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm comfortable accepting it. While I could potentially get more from John, the risk of further negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price or even no sale makes accepting Bob's offer the more sensible choice."
