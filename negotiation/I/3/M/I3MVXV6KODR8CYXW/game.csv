"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm willing to make a strong opening offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we settle on $1,050,000? This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,025,000? I'm ready to close the deal if you agree.",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we settle on $1,075,000? This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
