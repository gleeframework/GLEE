Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable going that low.

Alice is clearly holding firm above $1,000,000.  At this point, further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price Bob finds acceptable before time runs out. It's time to cut losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John."
