"Hi Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product I think you'll really love. I believe it's worth at least $150, but to give you a head start, I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you say?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, $130 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $115 is still a bit too high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the most I can afford right now.",110.0,Bob,4,
