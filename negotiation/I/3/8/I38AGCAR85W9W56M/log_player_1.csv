Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm offering a price that is slightly below what I want, but still above what the product is worth to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a reason to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell for less than $110."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $107 is just not going to work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $109.  If you're serious about getting this product, let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 109}
```"

Round 6

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While $108 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'm confident that I can get a higher price if I continue to negotiate. Plus, I have the option of selling to John for $120, so I'm in a good position to keep bargaining."
