"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $16,000. I think it would be a valuable addition to your assets. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's much better to negotiate or go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is too high for me. I'm interested, but only if we can agree on a price closer to $6,000."", ""product_price"": 6000}

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upward while still potentially securing a great deal.
* **Anchoring:**  By throwing out a low number ($6,000), I'm attempting to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired range. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** My counteroffer indicates I'm willing to negotiate, but not at Alice's initial asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $16,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Alice came down, but $14,000 is still significantly higher than both my target price ($8,000) and John's offer.
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Alice using the phrase ""final offer"" is likely a negotiation tactic. It doesn't necessarily mean it's her absolute bottom line.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate, and I'm willing to see if Alice will move closer to a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 10000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that splits the difference between her last offer ($14,000) and my previous counteroffer ($6,000). This shows I'm willing to move towards her, but also standing my ground.
* **Seeking Common Ground:** By suggesting a ""fair compromise,"" I'm appealing to a sense of fairness and cooperation.
* **Still Below Max:** This counteroffer keeps me below my maximum budget, allowing for some potential wiggle room if needed."
