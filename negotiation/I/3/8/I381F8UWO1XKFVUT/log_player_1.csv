Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $8,500 is still too low for me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for your business."", ""product_price"": 9000}

While $8,250 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,250 still doesn't quite work for me.  Let's aim for a final compromise at $8,750.  This gives us both a fair deal and allows me to move forward with this sale. "", ""product_price"": 8750}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds. To avoid risking further reductions and losing more time, I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000."
