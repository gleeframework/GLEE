"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product.  While $10000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $12500? This still gives you a good deal, and it's a price I can work with.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10000. Would you be willing to meet me at $11500? I think that's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
