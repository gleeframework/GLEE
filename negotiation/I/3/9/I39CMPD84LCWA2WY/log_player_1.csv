{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down a bit.
* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  Offering it at $925,000 gives him a potential profit of $75,000, a strong incentive to buy. 
* **Above Your Minimum:**  The price is significantly higher than your $800,000 fallback option (John), ensuring you maximize your potential profit. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. He may try to negotiate a lower price, and you'll need to decide how low you're willing to go while still exceeding your $800,000 minimum."
