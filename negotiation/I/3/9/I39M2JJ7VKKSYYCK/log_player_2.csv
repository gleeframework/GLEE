Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer.  I've done my research and truly believe this product is worth considerably more in your hands. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product offers you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move up on your offer. To be frank, I'm getting close to what I need for this product.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,275,000?  This reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away satisfied.
