"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of your product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $700000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000.

Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,
