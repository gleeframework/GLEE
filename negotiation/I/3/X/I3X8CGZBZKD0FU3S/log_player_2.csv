"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's much better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer at $1,000,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows my serious intent to buy but also sets a clear expectation of a lower price point.  It's a strong starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate, hoping to get closer to my target price of $1,200,000 or below.  I'll try to counter again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to $1,250,000. This demonstrates that I'm serious about buying and willing to compromise. It's also still significantly lower than Alice's last offer, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary. My goal is to get as close as possible to my $1,200,000 target without risking going over."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high, and we're already at round 5.  It's unlikely we'll be able to get much lower with Alice, and with only 5 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal is high.  It's time to secure the product at a known price from John, even though it's slightly above my ideal target."
