"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11500 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $10500.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $10500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  If you can come down to $10750, I'd be happy to finalize the deal. Let's find a price that works for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $10750 is still too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10875.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach an agreement.  Let's make this happen!",10875.0,Alice,5,
