"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me, and still a good price for you. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $8,000?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to make a decent profit. Let's find a way to make this work!",8000.0,Alice,3,
