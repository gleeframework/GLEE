"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me, and still a good price for you. Let me know what you think!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $8,000?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to make a decent profit. Let's find a way to make this work!
