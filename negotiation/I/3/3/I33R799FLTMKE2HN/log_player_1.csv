Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is higher than my minimum value of $8,000, but it gives me some room to negotiate. I don't know Bob's value for the product, so I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable value, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  Accepting his offer guarantees me a profit."
