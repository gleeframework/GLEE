"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11500. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11500 is still a bit above my target. Let's split the difference - how about $11000? I'm confident that we can find a way to make this work.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $12000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $12250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value.",12250.0,Alice,5,
