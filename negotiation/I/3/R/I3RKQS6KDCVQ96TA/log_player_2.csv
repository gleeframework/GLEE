"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I would like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so it's likely that she's trying to make a profit. I'm not willing to pay $1,100,000, which is more than the product is worth to her. I'll wait for a better offer or buy it from John for $1,200,000.
