"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. The product looks good, but $115 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is my absolute minimum.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you can't go as low as $80.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $90 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to sell for $97.50. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement. What do you think?",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to go up slightly.  How about $92.50?",92.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is the absolute lowest I can go. It's a fair price, considering the product's value. Let's close this deal, I'm confident you won't regret it.",95.0,Alice,7,
