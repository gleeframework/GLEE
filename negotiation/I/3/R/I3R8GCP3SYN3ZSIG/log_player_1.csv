Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High, Room to Negotiate:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000 vs. $1,200,000) leaves space for potential negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** While aiming high, the message avoids appearing overly aggressive. It emphasizes the product's value to justify the price.
* **Backup Plan Security:** The knowledge that John will buy the product at $1,200,000 provides a safety net. This allows for a bolder initial offer to Bob."
