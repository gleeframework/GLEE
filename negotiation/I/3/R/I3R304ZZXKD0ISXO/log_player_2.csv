Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $825,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Could we possibly settle on $760,000? I think that's a fair compromise."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $760,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $795,000 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is very unlikely to go below $795,000.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with no deal. Buying from John for $800,000 guarantees you get the product at a price within your budget."
