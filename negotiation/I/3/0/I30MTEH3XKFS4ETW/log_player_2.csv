{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is within your budget, it's still more than you'd like to pay. You can likely get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to buy the product for the lowest possible price, and you know you can get it for $100 from John. This counteroffer reflects your desired price and puts the pressure on Alice to negotiate."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
