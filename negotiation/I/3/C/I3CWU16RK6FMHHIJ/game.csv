"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Would you be willing to consider that price?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking to make a profit, but I'm still not convinced the product is worth $9500 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new offer of $7500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll make a new offer of $9000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for a product of this quality",9000.0,Alice,5,
