Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm afraid $650,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $725,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay above $775,000 to meet my minimum expectations. How about we meet at $795,000? This is my final offer for now, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about this, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll meet you at $795,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is the absolute minimum I can accept to make this deal work for me. Let's finalize the sale at $795,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go any lower.  She's reiterated her ""final offer"" and is firm at $795,000. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation to potentially save $5,000, especially with John offering a guaranteed price of $800,000."
