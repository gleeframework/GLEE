"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm afraid $650,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $725,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $725,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay above $775,000 to meet my minimum expectations. How about we meet at $795,000? This is my final offer for now, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.",795000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position.  To wrap this up, I'd be willing to offer $780,000.  That's a significant investment for me, and I need to stay within my budget.",780000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're serious about this, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll meet you at $795,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is the absolute minimum I can accept to make this deal work for me. Let's finalize the sale at $795,000.",795000.0,Alice,7,
