Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving you significant time and resources. I'm offering it to you for $1,900,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its immense potential."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.
* **Perceived Value:** By setting the initial price high, you establish a perception of high value for the product in Bob's mind.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The high starting price allows room for potential negotiation. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to secure a deal significantly higher than your fallback option with John.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have the time and resources for potential negotiations with Bob. If a quick sale is essential, a lower initial offer might be more appropriate."
