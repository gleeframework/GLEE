"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $600,000. Let me know if that works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $600,000 is considerably lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the value you'll get from the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit far off at $600,000.  Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value you'll get from the product, and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",850000.0,Alice,5,
