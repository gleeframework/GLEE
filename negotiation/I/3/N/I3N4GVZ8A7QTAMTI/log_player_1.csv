Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,200,000. It's a significant value proposition for you, and I believe it's a fair price given its worth to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $600,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to accept a price that is so far below what the product is worth to me.  I'll counteroffer to try and reach a more reasonable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $600,000 is considerably lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the value you'll get from the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit far off at $600,000.  Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has come up slightly from his previous offer, $700,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept a price that is so significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value you'll get from the product, and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
