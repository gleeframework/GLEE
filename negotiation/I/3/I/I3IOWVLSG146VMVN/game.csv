"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested but $120 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be happy to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $105? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $105 is still a bit out of my range. How about we meet at $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $98? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",98.0,Alice,5,
