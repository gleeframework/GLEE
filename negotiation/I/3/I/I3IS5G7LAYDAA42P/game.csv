"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your offer, $8,000 is quite a bit below its value.  I could consider coming down to $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $10,000? That feels like a fair price to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
