"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:**  The product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Alice's Offer:**  Alice is offering the product for $110.
* **John's Price:**  John is selling the product for $120.

Since Bob can get the product from John for $120, rejecting Alice's offer of $110 allows him to potentially negotiate a better price with Alice or buy from John at his maximum price."
