"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $13,000 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's make a deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,500. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,5,
