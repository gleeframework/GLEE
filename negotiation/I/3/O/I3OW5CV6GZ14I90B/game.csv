"I understand your position Alice, and I'm still very interested in the product. How about $115? That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows how serious I am about buying.",115.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your seriousness, Bob, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and my previous offer of $140. How about we try $127.50?",127.5,Alice,7,
