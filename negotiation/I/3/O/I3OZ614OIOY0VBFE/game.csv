,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $11000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11500. Can you consider that?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $13000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, so I'm counteroffering at $13000. This is my final offer below the original price I was thinking of.",13000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I think I can do slightly better than that. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a bit closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $12500. This is my last serious offer.",12500.0,Alice,9,
