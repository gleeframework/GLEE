"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. Let me start by offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $100 is still too high for him, given that he values the product at $120. He should counteroffer to bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, I'm still looking to pay closer to my value of the product.  Let's try $90, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to keep the negotiation going. How about I offer the product to you for $95 this time? Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his desired price. While he might be able to squeeze Alice down further, the risk of her rejecting his counteroffer or the negotiation dragging on is high. At $95, Bob saves $25 compared to buying from John, and it's within his acceptable range.  He should accept the offer to secure the purchase."
