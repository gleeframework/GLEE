"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $17,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is simply too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $16,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I believe it still represents a good value for you.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,500, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement on this offer.",15500.0,Bob,4,
