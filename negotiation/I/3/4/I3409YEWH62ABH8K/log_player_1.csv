Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for you, as you've indicated the product is worth $800,000 to you.  I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target:** I want to get as close to my minimum value ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Bob is willing to pay $800,000, so there's room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm offering $1,400,000, giving Bob a significant discount while still leaving me a good profit.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer provides a safety net. If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed alternative.

**By offering a price slightly lower than my minimum, I create an incentive for Bob to accept while still protecting my financial interests.**"
