Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting close to my minimum, I believe I can still secure a better price. I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $1,050,000 at this point, so I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This is my final attempt to get a price closer to my minimum. I've conceded a significant amount, and I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and meet me in the middle. If he rejects this offer, I'll be forced to either settle for John's lower offer or risk losing the deal altogether."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I'm not confident I can get a better price from him, and I risk losing out on a deal completely. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $800,000. This ensures I still make a profit, even if it's not as high as I hoped."
