Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,200.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice walks away. Accepting this offer secures a reasonable price for the product."
