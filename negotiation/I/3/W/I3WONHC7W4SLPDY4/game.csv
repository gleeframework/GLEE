"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,500?  That feels like a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8200.0,Alice,5,
