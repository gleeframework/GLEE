"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:** 

Since the maximum you're willing to spend is $120, and Alice's initial offer is $120, there's no immediate benefit to accepting. It's worth exploring if you can get a lower price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $100. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for further negotiation.  It's a good starting point to see if Alice is flexible on her price."
