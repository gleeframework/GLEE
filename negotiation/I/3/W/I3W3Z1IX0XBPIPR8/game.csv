"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $900000 for the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'd be willing to pay $850000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and allows us to close the deal quickly.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850000 yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $875000. This is still a competitive offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $875000 is closer to my target, but let's try to bridge the gap further. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. I'm prepared to pay $860000. This shows my commitment to reaching an agreement, and it's still a fair price for a product of this caliber. What do you say?",860000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not quite ready to accept $860000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $880000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",880000.0,Alice,5,
