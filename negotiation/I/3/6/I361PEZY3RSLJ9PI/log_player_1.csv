Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is fair to both of us, giving Bob a good deal while ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $90 is still a good profit for me, and it's likely he won't go lower.  Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale."
