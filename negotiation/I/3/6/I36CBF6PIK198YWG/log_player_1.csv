Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I believe it's a great deal and would be very valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
This is a strong starting point for Alice. It positions the offer as beneficial to Bob while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm looking to save as much as I can. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I know the product is worth significantly more to him.  I'm willing to negotiate further to try and reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

Here's why this is a good counteroffer:

* **Shows willingness to negotiate:**  By moving down from the initial $95, Alice demonstrates she's open to finding a compromise.
* **Still above the minimum:**  The $90 price point keeps Alice well above her $80 minimum and ensures a good profit.
* **Appeals to fairness:** Framing the offer as ""meeting in the middle"" can be persuasive and make Bob more receptive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, how about $87.50? I really think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is clearly bargain-hunting but is still within a reasonable price range. Accepting his offer of $87.50 gives Alice a solid profit above her minimum while avoiding the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for $80."
