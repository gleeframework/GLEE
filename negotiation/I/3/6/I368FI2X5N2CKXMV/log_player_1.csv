{""product_price"": 12000} 
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum price, hoping Bob might be willing to pay it. If he rejects, I'll have to decide if I want to negotiate further or sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $9,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my minimum.  Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to drop my price further.  I'll take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
