{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation. It also provides a reason for Bob to buy from you, highlighting its potential value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $130 is better than Bob's initial value, it's still below my minimum of $150. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, keeping the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $130 is tempting, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $140?  That would give you a good deal and still be fair for me."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $130. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $128? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $128 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Since John is willing to buy the product for my desired price, I'll take the guaranteed $150 from him."
