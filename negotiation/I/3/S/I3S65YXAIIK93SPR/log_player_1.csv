Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $95. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to aim higher than that with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Stay Above Your Minimum:** This price ensures you make a profit even if Bob manages to negotiate a slightly lower price.

This strategy aims to get you the best possible price while still making the sale to Bob more appealing than waiting for John."
