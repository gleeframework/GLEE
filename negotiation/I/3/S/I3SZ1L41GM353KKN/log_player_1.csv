Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate.
* **Below your minimum acceptable price:** This provides a buffer and ensures you don't sell below your own valuation.

By starting with this offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Remember, you always have the option to move on to John if Bob rejects your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. It's a great product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to accept his offer,  rejecting it allows you to maintain your leverage and potentially negotiate a better price.  You can counter with a price closer to your initial offer, hoping to reach a compromise. Remember, selling to John remains a viable option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $1,350,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows you to still get a great deal on this valuable product."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and it's likely that further negotiation will only lead to a lower price.  While you could attempt to counteroffer again, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or a complete rejection."
