"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think it could be very valuable for you. I'm asking for $14,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $14,500 is above his maximum budget, and he can get the product for $10,000 from John.  It makes sense to counteroffer Alice and see if she's willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate you thinking of me, $14,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,500 is already a very competitive price for this product. Could you meet me halfway at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's counteroffer of $12,500 is still above Bob's budget, and he can get the product for a lower price from John.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice as there's a better option available."
