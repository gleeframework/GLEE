"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but also leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and highlights the value of the product to Bob.  This helps create a positive tone for the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer sets the stage for a potential win-win situation. I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my minimum value, but I'm also willing to negotiate. The early rounds will be focused on gauging Bob's interest and understanding his potential counteroffers.  If he's unwilling to budge, I'll have the option to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is below my minimum value of $15,000. While it's closer to his perceived value, it's still not a deal I'm willing to accept. I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price, closer to my desired range. This will allow me to explore the possibilities of a more favorable deal. I'm also aware that selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, which gives me a strong bargaining position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“  I'm prepared to accept $10,500 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable investment. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,500:** This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $9,000 and my previous offer of $12,000. 
* **Message:** The message emphasizes fairness and the value of the product, aiming to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer shows flexibility while still protecting my minimum value. By splitting the difference, I'm hoping to reach a deal quickly.  If Bob rejects this offer again, I'll need to decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is a good compromise and a significant improvement over his previous offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum value of $15,000. 

**Strategy:**

 Accepting this offer ensures a sale and allows me to avoid the risk of further negotiation. It's important to note that selling to John for $15,000 is still an option, but there's no guarantee that he will be available for a longer period.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale at a decent price, and it's a win for both of us."
