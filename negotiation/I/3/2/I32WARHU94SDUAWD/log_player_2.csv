"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's desired maximum of $12,000.  It's worth seeing if Bob can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting his negotiation by offering a price that is halfway between Alice's offer and his own maximum budget.  This shows that he's serious about buying the product, but also that he's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $10,800. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,800 is within Bob's budget of $12,000 and is a good compromise given her previous rejection.  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and potentially raising her price makes it advantageous to accept at this point.  There's a good chance that Bob could get a better price from John, but accepting Alice's offer eliminates the risk of having to pay the full $12,000."
