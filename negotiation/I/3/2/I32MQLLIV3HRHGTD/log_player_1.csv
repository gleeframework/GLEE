Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value without explicitly stating Bob's perceived value. This allows room for him to accept the price or counter-offer.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning listing the product publicly creates a subtle sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually lower the price, but never go below your minimum of $12,000."
