"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $800,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but there's room for negotiation.** $800,000 is a significant discount, but I want to see if I can get an even better price. 
* **It's early in the negotiation.** I have 10 rounds to work with, so I can afford to reject the initial offer and see what Alice's counteroffer is. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  If the negotiation fails, I can always go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 700000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair counteroffer:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, but still leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a way to find a price that works for both of us. This helps build rapport and suggests a willingness to compromise. 
* **Setting a clear price:**  I'm making a concrete offer, showing I'm serious about buying the product but also establishing my desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to accept. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has moved closer to my price.** Her offer of $750,000 is significantly closer to my counteroffer of $700,000, showing she's willing to compromise.
* **It's a good deal for me.**  $750,000 is still a substantial discount from the $1,000,000 I could pay John. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While I could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk Alice will become less willing to negotiate, or I might end up with no deal at all. Accepting her offer seems like the best way to secure a good price."
