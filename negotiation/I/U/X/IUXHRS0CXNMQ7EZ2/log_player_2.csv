"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You're better off rejecting Alice's offer. Although it's cheaper than John's offer, it's still more than the product is worth to you. By rejecting, you can still buy the product from John, but it's important to remember that this is the absolute maximum you're willing to pay."
