Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Your minimum:** You need to make at least $120 to make the sale worthwhile.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $150.
* **Negotiation:** By offering $140, you are likely to get a good price while still leaving room for negotiation.  If Bob accepts, you make a good profit. If he rejects, you can still sell to John for your minimum price."
