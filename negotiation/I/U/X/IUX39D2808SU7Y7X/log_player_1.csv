Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate and incentivizes Bob to counteroffer.
* **Positive framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value Bob will get. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price leaves room for me to negotiate down, but still allows me to earn significantly more than Bob's initial value. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I'll always have the option of selling to John for my desired price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you trying to work with me, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $9,000 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which still gives you a great value and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's meet in the middle and make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffering strategically:** I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's last offer, showing him that I'm not willing to give in easily. This also keeps the pressure on him to come up a bit more. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will still receive at this price, making it more appealing.
* **Finding a middle ground:**  I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my desired price but still potentially acceptable to Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This counteroffer still leaves room for further negotiation, but it puts me in a stronger position than accepting his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a little too high for me. I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $8,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250? This way, we both get a good deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,250 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to go that low. It's more profitable for me to sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I get my desired value and avoid further negotiation."
