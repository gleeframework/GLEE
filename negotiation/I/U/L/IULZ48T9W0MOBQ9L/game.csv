"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not comfortable going above $7000. Can you meet me halfway?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $7000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $7500.  This is still a fair price considering the value you place on the product. What do you say?",7500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $7500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $6800? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",6800.0,Bob,4,
