"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product and would be willing to pay $1,200,000.  It's a fair price for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the price I was initially thinking. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm happy to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're agreeable.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $1,280,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
