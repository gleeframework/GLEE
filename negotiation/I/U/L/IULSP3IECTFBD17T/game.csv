"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a great deal for you, considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position.  While the product is good, $1,050,000 is pushing it for me.  Could we agree on $975,000?  It's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
