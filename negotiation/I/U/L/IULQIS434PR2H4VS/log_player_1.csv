Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering what you could gain from it. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to maximize profit but also need to make the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):**  You have a guaranteed fallback option with John at $1,500,000.
* **The Offer:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 creates a potential profit margin of $150,000 for you. This is a significant gain for you while still leaving Bob with a perceived ""discount"" of $150,000 compared to his valuation.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and making the offer appealing enough for Bob to accept."
