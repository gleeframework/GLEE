Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a strong opening position that leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. However, if he rejects, I'm prepared to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum value of $1,500,000. If Bob rejects this offer, I can always move on to John and secure a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I believe this price is fair and leaves room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and I'm comfortable accepting it.  It's a decent profit, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely."
