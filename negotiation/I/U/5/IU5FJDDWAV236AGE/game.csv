"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $12,000 is a tempting offer, I know the true value of this product is considerably higher. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $13,500. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you clearly see the value in this product, which I appreciate.  Let's wrap this up, I'm willing to come down to $14,250.  This is my final offer, as it's important we both walk away feeling we got a fair deal.",14250.0,Alice,5,
