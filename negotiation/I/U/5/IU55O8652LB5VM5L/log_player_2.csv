"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, and I know it's worth the same to you. I'm willing to let you have it for $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I will reject Alice's offer because I can buy the product from John for $8,000, which is less than Alice's offer.
