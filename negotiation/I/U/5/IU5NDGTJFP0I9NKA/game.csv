"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that's worth a lot to me, and I believe it could be valuable to you as well. I'm asking for $20000 for it.  If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss it further. If not, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay $15000.  What do you say?",20000.0,Alice,1,
