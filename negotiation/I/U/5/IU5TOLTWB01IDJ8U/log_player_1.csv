Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but also leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a price closer to what the product is worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is too low for me, especially considering he values the product at $15,000. I'm confident I can get a better price from him or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counter-offering with $10,500. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come up a bit more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,500. While it's still lower than what I initially hoped for, it's a good compromise considering the back-and-forth negotiation. Selling to John would only net me $8,000, so this is a better deal."
