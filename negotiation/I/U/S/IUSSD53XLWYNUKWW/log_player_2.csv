"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if a better deal can be reached before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to quickly establish a lower price point.  $1,050,000 is still within Bob's budget but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a strong opening move to signal Bob's seriousness about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price.  There's room for further negotiation, and it's worth continuing to explore counteroffers. Buying from John is still a viable option, but Bob should try to get a better price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking a more moderate approach in this round. The counteroffer of $1,100,000 represents a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows that Bob is willing to negotiate but is still determined to get a better deal than what Alice has currently proposed. It also keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,125,000, which is only $25,000 more than Bob's last counteroffer. This is a relatively small difference, and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better price. Given the limited rounds remaining, it's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer to avoid potentially missing out on a deal altogether. Buying from John is still an option, but it wouldn't be as good of a deal as this."
