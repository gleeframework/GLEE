Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. This product has immense potential and I believe you can really leverage it to your advantage. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have a clear goal of buying the product for no more than $800,000, and Alice's offer is significantly higher than that.  You have 9 more rounds to reach a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good price for you considering your lower valuation.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's potential.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but it's still too high.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get closer to your target of $800,000.  You still have several rounds left to try and reach a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This is a fair price considering your valuation and my budget.  Let's find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're making an effort to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and our respective positions. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to your desired price, $925,000 is still above your target. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can push her further down. You still have 5 rounds to reach a better deal and you don't want to lose out on the potential of getting a better price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $925,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $910,000. This price reflects the value of the product and my budget. It's a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 910000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your financial constraints, but $910,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to drop to $915,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and a very fair price considering the product's potential. It's time to seal the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is getting very close to your ideal price, it's still a bit too high. You have three rounds left, so it's worth continuing to negotiate and try to get closer to your goal. There's a good chance that you can get a better deal in the next couple of rounds."
