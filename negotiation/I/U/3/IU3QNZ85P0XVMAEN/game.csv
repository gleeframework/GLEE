,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good price for you considering your lower valuation.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's potential.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This is a fair price considering your valuation and my budget.  Let's find a middle ground here.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're making an effort to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and our respective positions. Let's see if we can close this deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $925,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $910,000. This price reflects the value of the product and my budget. It's a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your financial constraints, but $910,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to drop to $915,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and a very fair price considering the product's potential. It's time to seal the deal.",915000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $915,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $905,000, which is a fair price given the value of the product and our respective positions. It's time to reach a compromise and close this deal.",905000.0,Bob,8,
