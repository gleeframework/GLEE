"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8500 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8500 is simply too low for me at this point.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, though. How about $9000? This would still be a great value for you and allow us to both walk away satisfied.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit hesitant at $9000. How about we split the difference and go with $8750? I think that would be a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for us both. While $8750 is closer, it's still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $8900. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8900.0,Alice,5,
