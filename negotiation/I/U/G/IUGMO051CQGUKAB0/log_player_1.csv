"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation but still maximizing my initial profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I highlight the product's value to create an incentive for Bob to buy. 

This strategy aims to:

* Get a good starting price.
* Encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing for potential movement toward a mutually beneficial agreement.
* Maintain the option to sell to John if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8500 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my floor of $8,000.  
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I have several rounds left and there's still room for Bob to increase his offer.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I keep the power dynamic in my favor and demonstrate that I'm serious about getting a fair price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, but still leaving room for compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me at this point.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, though. How about $9,000? This would still be a great value for you and allow us to both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** My counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer ($9,500) and Bob's offer ($8,500). This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterate value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to emphasize why my price is still fair.
* **Positive language:** I continue using a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation positive. 

**Goal:**

* To secure a price that's closer to my desired range.
* To nudge Bob towards a more acceptable offer.
* To avoid rejecting his offer again, potentially risking a further decrease in his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit hesitant at $9000. How about we split the difference and go with $8750? I think that would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired range, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** With several rounds remaining, I believe there's still potential to get a price closer to my ideal.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I show Bob that I'm committed to achieving a price that reflects the true value of the product.

**Next Steps:**

*  I will counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my previous offer but still above my minimum, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while maintaining my position."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for us both. While $8,750 is closer, it's still a bit low for me.
