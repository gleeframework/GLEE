"Bob, I have a product I believe you would find very valuable. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it holds similar value for you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's potential and our existing relationship. Let me know if you're interested.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
