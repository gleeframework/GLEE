,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18,000 is way too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $8,000. I'm willing to pay $8,500 right now, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. My counteroffer is $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $12,000, but it's still a bit too high for me. I'm really pushing the limits of my budget here.  How about $9,500? I'm hoping we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $9,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. My counteroffer is $13,000 for the product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
