**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $15,000.**  This suggests there's room for negotiation.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is very close to your last counteroffer and within your budget.** This is a good deal considering you have only 3 rounds left.
* **There is a high chance Alice will not lower the price further.**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price, saving you $3,750 compared to buying from John.**"
