"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 
 
This offer is a little higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and still gives me a good profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium to secure it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $12,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply not feasible for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? It's still a great price for you, considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit far from $15,000. I'm willing to go up to $13,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,500 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'm going to counteroffer one more time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about we settle on $14,000? This price allows me to cover my costs and gives you a good deal.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,750. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but not quite there.  The negotiation is getting tedious, and it's becoming clear that we may not be able to agree.  To avoid further rounds of back and forth, I'm going to take John's offer of $15,000 and sell the product to him.  This ensures I get my minimum desired price and avoids any more haggling."
