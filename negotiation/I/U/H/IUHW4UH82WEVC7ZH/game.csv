"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $100, so how about $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $95 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $98. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not convinced. I'm willing to go up to $96, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at $96?",96.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $96 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $96 and $98, so how about we go with $97? Let me know if you're on board.",97.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I want to meet you at the middle again, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $96, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you think about meeting me at $96?",96.0,Bob,8,
