"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $20,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to spend. I'm genuinely interested in this product but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time.  This is my top price,  let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $20,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being more flexible, but $17,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $12,000.  This is a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair price reflecting the value I see in this product.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,000 is closer to where we need to be, there's still a gap.  I'm willing to accept $15,000. This is my final offer, as I already have another buyer interested at this price.",15000.0,Alice,5,
