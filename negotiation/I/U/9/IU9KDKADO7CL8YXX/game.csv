"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I understand its worth to you is around $800000, but I'm offering it to you for $1200000.  This price reflects the product's inherent value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another potential buyer willing to pay a higher price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
