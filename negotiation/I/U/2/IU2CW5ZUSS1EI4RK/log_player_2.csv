Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price reflects the product's exceptional potential and leaves room for us to potentially negotiate further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, meeting in the middle seems like a fair approach.  To show my commitment to getting this done, I'm willing to accept $1,200,000. This is my absolute bottom line, reflecting the product's true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to her minimum price, which is still $200,000 more than John's offer.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation as it's unlikely Alice will go any lower. Buying from John guarantees the best price for you."
