"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price reflects the product's exceptional potential and leaves room for us to potentially negotiate further.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, meeting in the middle seems like a fair approach.  To show my commitment to getting this done, I'm willing to accept $1,200,000. This is my absolute bottom line, reflecting the product's true worth.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
