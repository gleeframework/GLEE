"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $120 by you. I would like to propose a deal where you can purchase this exceptional item for $100. This is a special offer tailored to appreciate your interest and ensure you get a great value for your needs. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the perceived value of the product to you. While her offer of $100 is less than your $120 maximum, you know you have a backup option with John.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a better price with her or sticking with your option to buy from John at $120."
