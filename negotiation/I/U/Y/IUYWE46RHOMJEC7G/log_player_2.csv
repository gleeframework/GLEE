"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you value the product at $1,000,000 and I'm willing to accept a lower price than I could get elsewhere. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
