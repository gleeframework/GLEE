Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting high, at $120, because I know the product is worth at least $100 to me.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the potential value for Bob.  

This strategy is designed to:

* **Maximize profit:** I'm aiming for the highest possible price, even though it's likely Bob will counteroffer.
* **Start strong:**  By starting high, I establish a starting point for negotiation. 
* **Keep options open:** If Bob rejects, I can still counteroffer or move on to John, ensuring I don't lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $100. 
* **Counteroffer:** I'm not ready to settle for that price yet. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum.
* **Keeping John in mind:**  While $85 is better than nothing, I'm aware that John is willing to pay $100. This motivates me to negotiate harder."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, but still above my minimum value. This shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Reminder:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to sway him towards accepting a higher price. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging a compromise, aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'll go up to $90, but that's my final offer. If it doesn't work, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's final offer:** $90 is still below my minimum value of $100. 
* **John's offer:**  Since John is willing to pay $100, it makes more sense to sell to him.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks ending up with a lower price or even losing the deal altogether. 

Selling to John guarantees me the highest possible price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
