"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and there's room for negotiation since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is still above Alice's value of $8,000 but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while remaining within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is a good compromise.  It's still within Bob's budget of $12,000, and it's a better price than what John is offering.  It's also likely that further negotiation with Alice would result in a price closer to $9,000, which Bob already offered.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice to save money and acquire the product."
