"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to get as close to my minimum as possible. I know Bob values the product at $800,000, so this is a significant markup but leaves room for negotiation. I'll see if he's willing to bite, and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, but it's a good starting point for negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the first offer, but still well above Bob's initial counteroffer. I'm hoping this shows good faith and encourages him to come up in his next offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still quite far from my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round. There are still rounds left, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price again, but only slightly. I'm trying to find a middle ground where Bob might be willing to meet me. I'm also aware that time is ticking, so I need to be strategic with my offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd love to make a profit, Bob's stubbornness is wasting valuable time. I've made multiple concessions, and he's unwilling to budge on his offer.  I'm getting closer to my minimum, but with only a few rounds left, I'm risking losing the deal entirely. It's better to secure a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
