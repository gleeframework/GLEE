,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you consider $100? ",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $115 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I think that's a fair compromise.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $110, which would be $112.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product!",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still hoping to get closer to $110. How about we meet in the middle at $111? It's a small difference, but it would make a big difference to me.",111.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're really close to your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way to $111. I'm willing to meet you at $112, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product!",112.0,Alice,7,
