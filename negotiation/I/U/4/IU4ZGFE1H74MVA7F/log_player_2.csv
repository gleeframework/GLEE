Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $115 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $110, which would be $112.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still hoping to get closer to $110. How about we meet in the middle at $111? It's a small difference, but it would make a big difference to me."", ""product_price"": 111}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're really close to your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way to $111. I'm willing to meet you at $112, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is now only offering $112, which is within your budget and very close to your desired price. Since you only have 3 rounds left, it's likely you won't get a better offer, and you might end up having to buy from John.  It's best to accept the offer and secure the product."
