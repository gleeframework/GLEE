{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To make this work, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value the product holds for me.  I'm eager to work with you and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $850,000. I appreciate your willingness to work with me to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I need to make a profit, and $850,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value and the potential benefits it can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1,050,000 is still outside my range.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and my ability to pay.  Let's find common ground and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and meet me at $950,000. However, I'm still not at my minimum price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is my final offer before considering other options. I believe the product's value justifies this price, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your budget, but she's indicated this is her final offer.  It's risky, but you still have time to negotiate.  You'll likely need to offer a price closer to $950,000 to get her to budge, but you don't want to get stuck at a price higher than what you're comfortable with."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  I believe this reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget.  Let's finalize this deal at this price before considering other options."", ""product_price"": 975000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me at $975,000. However, I'm still not at my minimum price. I'm starting to consider other options, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000, which is my absolute minimum price.
