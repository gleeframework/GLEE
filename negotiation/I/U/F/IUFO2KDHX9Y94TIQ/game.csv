"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I understand you're on a budget, but $11,200 is still a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,350? That's a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",11350.0,Alice,5,
