Alice's offer:

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  I'll reject and counteroffer again."

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above my ideal price point.  Since I can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, I'm going to take that option and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
