"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product, recognizing its value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're still willing to make a deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, which is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. Let's see if we can make it work.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
