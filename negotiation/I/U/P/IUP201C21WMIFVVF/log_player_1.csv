{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** It's below Bob's perceived value but still significantly above your minimum.
* **Shows confidence:** It demonstrates you believe the product is worth a substantial amount.
* **Establishes a clear starting point:** It gives Bob something concrete to consider. 

I'm choosing to start with a higher offer because I want to see if Bob is willing to pay closer to the value he perceives. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counter-offer and the possibility of selling to John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This price is fair considering its value to you and my budget.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum of $800,000, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  There's room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price. 

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price to see if we can find a compromise that benefits both of us.  If he rejects my counteroffer, I'll reassess the situation and consider selling to John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows you to get a good deal and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above my minimum:** This price remains significantly above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I make a decent profit.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  The message emphasizes finding a solution that works for both of us, creating a positive tone for continued negotiations. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price. If he rejects it, I'll reassess the situation and consider my options, including selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is closer, but still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This price gives you a good profit margin and is within my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is very close to my desired price and significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,050,000,  accepting his offer ensures a good profit and finalizes the deal. There's a good chance that continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or Bob backing out completely, so accepting his offer is the most sensible option at this point."
