Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Room for compromise:**  This price allows for some potential counteroffers from Bob while still guaranteeing a profit for me.
* **Positive tone:** Using a positive tone encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Flexibility:** If Bob rejects the offer, I have the option to counter-offer or walk away and sell to John for my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Could you do $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Seeking a better deal:**  I'm not willing to sell for such a low price, and I want to see if I can get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and emphasizing that the price is still a good deal for him.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Flexibility:** If Bob rejects this offer, I still have the option to either make another counteroffer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $7,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and still below my perceived value of the product.
* **Possible counter-offer:** I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to make sure any counter-offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Avoiding a loss:**  Selling for $7,000 would result in a significant loss for me. I'd prefer to continue negotiating or sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $7,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $8,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while still getting you a great value. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer, demonstrating a willingness to find a middle ground.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair deal for both parties, emphasizing that it benefits both of us.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a positive tone to keep the negotiation friendly and encouraging.
* **Strategic:** This offer is closer to my desired price point, and I believe Bob may be more inclined to accept it, especially after rejecting my previous offer.  
* **Flexibility:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can still choose to make another counteroffer or sell to John."
