"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price more in the range of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I still need to ensure I receive a fair return on my investment. Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000. I believe this price is reasonable and allows both of us to walk away happy. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices, so I'm offering $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
