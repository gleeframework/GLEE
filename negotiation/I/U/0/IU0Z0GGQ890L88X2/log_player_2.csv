**Reasoning:**

While $90 is less than your maximum budget of $120, there's room for negotiation. You can try to get a better price from Alice."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $85? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $95. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to get her closer to my desired price of $85."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $85. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $90? I'm confident that this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? It's a fair compromise that still gives me a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $92.50 is only $2.50 more than my desired price of $90.  Since it's still within my budget and a relatively small difference, accepting her offer is the best decision to save time and avoid further negotiation."
