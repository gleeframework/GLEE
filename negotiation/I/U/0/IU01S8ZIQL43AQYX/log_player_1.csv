Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere closer to $8000? I'd love to discuss further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $8,000 is significantly less than my minimum value for the product. I'll try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which still reflects the value of the product while offering you a good price. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, could we possibly agree on $10000 for the product? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, $10,000 is my minimum value for the product, and it's a good compromise considering Bob's budget constraints.  It's better to secure a sale at this price than to risk further negotiations and potentially have to sell to John for the same amount."
