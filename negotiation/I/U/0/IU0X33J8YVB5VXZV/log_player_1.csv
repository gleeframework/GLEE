I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. If he rejects, I can always lower the price in subsequent counteroffers, but I'll need to see how eager he is to buy before making further concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, I'm not ready to settle yet.  I believe the product is worth more, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer.  I believe it's a fair price that still reflects the value I place on the product, while also demonstrating my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to my desired price range. While I'd prefer a bit more, I don't want to risk losing the sale and ending up with only $1,000,000 from John. Accepting this offer is a good compromise and secures a profitable deal."
