"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $85. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to spend $85. Would you be willing to go down to $78? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",78.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $78. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I can offer you the product for $82. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",82.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $82 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $79, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",79.0,Bob,6,
