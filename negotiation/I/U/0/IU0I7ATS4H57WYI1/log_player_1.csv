"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000.  This is a significant discount from my minimum value, but I'm leaving room to negotiate. It's important to start strong and gauge Bob's interest before lowering the price too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm still holding out for a better price. I want to see if I can push for closer to my initial offer.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $975,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers. It shows good faith while still aiming for a price closer to my desired amount."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied. There are several rounds left, and I'm willing to keep negotiating.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000.  This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but it shows a willingness to compromise.  It also puts the pressure back on Bob to decide if he's willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my minimum value,  I'm still not satisfied. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better deal. There are still several rounds left, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 930000}
```

I'm offering $930,000. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will show Bob that I'm serious about reaching a deal, but I'm also not willing to go lower than this.  I'm hoping that he'll accept this offer, but if he rejects, I'm prepared to sell to John for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only three rounds remaining, and Bob's offer still below my minimum value, I'm going to take the guaranteed offer from John.  I've held out for a better price, but it's getting too risky to continue with Bob.  Selling to John ensures I meet my minimum goal and avoids the potential for an even lower offer from Bob in the final rounds."
