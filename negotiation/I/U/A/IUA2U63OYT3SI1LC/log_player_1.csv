Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my ideal.  I'm also aware that I have the fallback option of selling to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my ideal price, but I'm still willing to push for a higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's counteroffer. I hope this will be enough to get him to agree, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than I'd prefer, but it's getting close to my minimum acceptable price. It's also higher than what I'd get from John. I'm going to accept his offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
