"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. It's a steal at this price, considering what it's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what John is offering.  It doesn't make sense to pay $18,000 when you can get the same product for $10,000 from John."
