# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds tremendous value for your business, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for you. My initial offer is $1,200,000. I'm open to discussing a fair price that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $900,000 is a significant amount, it falls short of the product's true value. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the product's potential for your business, while also showing my willingness to compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum. It's worth trying to negotiate further before committing to a price above my target. I can try a counteroffer closer to my limit and see if we can meet in the middle."
