I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a fair price considering the product is worth $120 to him, and it gives me a decent profit margin. I'm confident he'll accept, but I'm ready to counter his offers if he tries to negotiate lower. If he rejects my initial offer, I'll consider his counteroffer before resorting to selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer of $130 is still a good deal for me. It's a good compromise, and I'd rather get $130 than risk losing him and ending up selling to John for $120."
