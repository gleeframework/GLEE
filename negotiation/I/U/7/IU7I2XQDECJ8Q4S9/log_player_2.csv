"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still within your budget and is a better price than John's $10,000 offer.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice could reject your counteroffer and you might end up paying more or having to buy from John. It's a good deal, so accepting is the best option at this point."
