Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price, close to my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation. This way, I can see if Bob is seriously interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm dropping the price a bit, but I'm still above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
