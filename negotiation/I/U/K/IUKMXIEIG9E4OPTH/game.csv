"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
