"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an ambitious offer. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially secures a higher final price.
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer is intentionally high to gauge Bob's reaction. If he accepts immediately, we've secured a fantastic deal. If he counters, we can begin to understand his price range. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  The presence of John, our backup buyer, provides a safety net. This allows us to be more assertive in our negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a more reasonable price. Considering the current market value and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,500,000 is a significant sum, we're aiming to maximize our profit. Bob's counteroffer indicates he's willing to pay a premium, but there's likely room for negotiation. We'll counter in the next round to guide the price closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1,500,000 is certainly a respectable figure, the true value of this product is undeniable. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,700,000?"",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This conveys a sense of compromise and fairness, potentially making Bob more receptive.
* **Strategic Concession:** By reducing our price by $200,000, we demonstrate flexibility while still maintaining a strong position. 
* **Time Consideration:**  We're still in the early rounds, so there's time for further negotiation. We don't want to concede too much too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but given my financial constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,700,000. I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested and engaged in the negotiation, incrementally increasing his offer. However,  $1,600,000 is still a significant amount below our initial ask.  We'll continue negotiating, but we need to signal that our price has a firm floor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your position. However, this product represents a significant investment, and I need to ensure a fair return. I can go as low as $1,675,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1675000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:** By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and signal that further lowballing is unlikely to be successful. 
* **Small Concession:** The smaller price reduction ($25,000) reinforces the idea that we're reaching our limit.
* **Balancing Profit and Risk:**  While we aim for the highest price, dragging out negotiations carries the risk of Bob walking away. This offer balances potential profit with the security of a guaranteed sale at a strong price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1,650,000. This is my final offer, as I am committed to staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,650,000 represents a 65% profit margin on our baseline value. This is a substantial return.
* **Finality:**  Bob has labeled this his ""final offer,"" signaling a potential end to the negotiation if we decline.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to push for a higher price (e.g., $1,662,500) carries the risk of Bob walking away. The potential gain from further negotiation is outweighed by the risk of losing this offer and potentially getting stuck with our backup of $1,000,000. 

It's time to secure a very profitable deal."
