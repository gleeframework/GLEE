Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming for a good profit, but also leaves room for negotiation.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I need to start somewhere and see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay $85 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to try to squeeze a bit more out of the negotiation. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a little."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about we split the difference and meet at $92.50? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
``` 
I'm countering with a price that's in the middle of my previous offer and his. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but I still want to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm willing to increase my offer to $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my desired price and a good compromise. Accepting this offer is the best option since I can make a profit and avoid the risk of a prolonged negotiation or selling to John at a lower price."
