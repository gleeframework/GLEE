"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$600,000 is a good price, but there's a lot of room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to come down further before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is to gauge her willingness to negotiate and see if there's a common ground.  While $400,000 is likely too low, it sets a starting point for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $500,000 is still a significant savings compared to John's price, there's room for further negotiation. I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial counteroffer of $400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $450,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better price than Alice's last offer. It's a reasonable middle ground and should hopefully encourage Alice to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $550,000, which is a good price considering my initial counteroffer of $400,000. Accepting this offer saves me a significant amount compared to John's price of $1,500,000. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting my offer and ultimately walking away is high. It's better to secure this deal at a good price."
