Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  While we know Bob values it at $80, aiming for a price closer to your minimum ($150) is ideal. $125 gives Bob a perceived discount while still netting you a significant profit.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, so there's no pressure to go below that."
