"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer. However, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind. Could you consider $13,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be well worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is still above Bob's budget.  While it's closer, Bob is determined to save as much money as possible. It's better to continue negotiating and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still finding it hard to meet your offer.  How about we split the difference somewhat? I'm willing to come down to $11,500. That's a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to make this deal work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $11,500, Bob is still determined to save more money. He's only willing to pay a maximum of $10,000, and Alice's offer is still above that. It makes sense to continue negotiating, as there's still room for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  $11,500 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  Let's close this deal and avoid going back and forth any further."", ""product_price"": 10500}
