"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me is significantly higher. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $13,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still significantly lower than what I'd get from another buyer.  Let's close this deal.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. How about we meet at $12,750? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $12,750 is simply not enough for me.  If you're truly interested in this product, I'm willing to go down to $13,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500 is too high, so how about $12,500 is not even an option, let's try $12,750 was too high, so let's try $12,500 - $250 = $12,250. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12250.0,Bob,6,
