"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,500 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I want to see if I can push him further towards my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $13,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still significantly lower than what I'd get from another buyer.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. How about we meet at $12,750? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer. $12,750 is still below my minimum but I will see if I can push Bob to come up a little more before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $12,750 is simply not enough for me.  If you're truly interested in this product, I'm willing to go down to $13,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500 is too high, so how about $12,500 is not even an option, let's try $12,750 was too high, so let's try $12,500 - $250 = $12,250. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm selling the product to John. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm running out of time and need to secure the deal. John's offer ensures I get my minimum and allows me to move on."
