"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8500 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9500. Let's split the difference and make this deal work. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  While negotiating further is an option, it's not guaranteed to lead to a price lower than $8,000. Buying from John for $8,000 is the most financially advantageous option for Bob, ensuring he gets the product within his budget."
