"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints,  $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise a bit further,  but I need to stay above $1,300,000 to make this deal worthwhile for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
