Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to start at a price of $1,300,000, reflecting the potential value it holds for your business."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value you place on the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired value of $1,500,000.  I have 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better price.  I'm also not in a rush, as I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints,  $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise a bit further,  but I need to stay above $1,300,000 to make this deal worthwhile for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I would like to propose a price of $1,225,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm still holding out for a higher price. While $1,225,000 is getting closer to my desired value, I have 6 rounds left and I'm not desperate to sell.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is always an option, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  I understand your financial limitations, but I still need to be above $1,200,000.  Let's split the difference and settle at $1,212,500.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1212500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. I would like to counter with a price of $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're at Round 6, and Bob is stubbornly holding firm at $1,200,000.  While I could continue to counteroffer, it's clear that we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price. I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000, which is significantly more than what Bob is willing to pay. It's time to cut my losses and secure the better deal with John."
