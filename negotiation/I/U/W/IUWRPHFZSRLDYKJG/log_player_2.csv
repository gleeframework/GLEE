"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. Given its value and quality, I believe it's worth more than what it costs us to produce. Considering the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $12,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. $12,000 is still above Bob's budget of $10,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you explaining the value of the product. However, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering my needs."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to consider your offer of $10,500. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $11,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is closer to his budget, he can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  He can still buy from John for $10,000, so there's no immediate need to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I appreciate your effort to reach an agreement. Considering our previous discussions, I am prepared to offer the product at a price of $10,900. This is a fair compromise that reflects both the value of the product and your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money, but also to secure the product. Alice's offer of $10,900 is very close to his budget and getting closer to John's price.  It's likely that further negotiation will result in minimal savings and the risk of losing the deal with Alice altogether.  Accepting the offer ensures he gets the product at a reasonable price without taking a significant risk."
