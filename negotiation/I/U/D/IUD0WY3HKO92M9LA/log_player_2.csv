Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than John's price, there's still room to negotiate and get a better deal.  Bob's initial counteroffer of $700,000 was close, and Alice is already willing to meet halfway.  There's a good chance Bob can get closer to his target price with another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to reach a compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $950,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept for this product, considering its value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you a deal at $875,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.

This is a good deal for Bob. He's able to get the product for a price significantly lower than John's offer, and it's close to his desired price range. There's not much more room for negotiation, and continuing to haggle might risk losing the deal altogether."
