"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $700,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and I'm confident it's a deal you won't want to pass up.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to reach a compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $950,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept for this product, considering its value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you a deal at $875,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",875000.0,Alice,5,
