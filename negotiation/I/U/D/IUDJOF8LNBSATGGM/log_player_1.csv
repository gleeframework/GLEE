Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is $400,000 higher than my minimum acceptable price, but significantly lower than the value to Bob. This strategy aims to strike a balance:

* **Attractive for Bob:** The price is lower than the value he gets from the product. 
* **Good for me:**  I'm still earning a substantial profit of $400,000 compared to selling to John. 

While Bob might try to negotiate further, this starting point leaves room for discussion without putting me in a position of losing too much."
