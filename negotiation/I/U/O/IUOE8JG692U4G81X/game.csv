"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm happy to go up to $1,100,000. If you're willing to meet me there, we can close the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $1,125,000 is a fair price for this product. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still not there. I'm willing to pay $1,110,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can get this deal done. What do you say?",1110000.0,Bob,6,
