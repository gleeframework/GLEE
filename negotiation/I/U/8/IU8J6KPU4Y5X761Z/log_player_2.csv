Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $680,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $700,000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's worth to me is $800,000. What do you think?

Alice is clearly holding firm to a price above $700,000.  At this point, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether. Accepting $700,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's offer."
