"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, to be honest. I've already made a few concessions, and I'm not sure I'm willing to make any more. I'm willing to meet you at $108, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other buyers.",108.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand your frustration, and I appreciate the effort you've put into negotiating with me. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $107 and $108, which would be $107.50. Can you consider that?",107.5,Bob,10,
