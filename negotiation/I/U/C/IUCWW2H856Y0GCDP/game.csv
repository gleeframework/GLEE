"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $700,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $800,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $750,000.
