Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above what I know the product is worth to Bob, but it's still within a range that might be attractive to him. I'm also leaving some room for negotiation. If Bob rejects my offer, I'll be prepared to negotiate further.  However, if he makes a counteroffer that I don't find acceptable, I'll be ready to move on to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price, but it's still better than selling to John for $1,000,000. I'll try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still trying to maximize my profit. I'm confident that this price is still attractive to Bob, given that he's already shown interest.  I'm hoping to close the deal in this round, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum price. I'm not confident I'll get a better offer from him, and selling to John will only net me $1,000,000. It's time to accept the offer."
