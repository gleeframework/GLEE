Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is higher than my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll have more information to work with when making a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm going to try to get a bit more.  Bob seems interested, so I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000.  This is a compromise,  still above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer.  I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,200 is only $200 less than my minimum. It's not ideal, but it's a better deal than selling to John."
