"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer in its industry and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer to get us started. Would you like to take a look?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Could we possibly negotiate a price closer to $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. How about we discuss a price of $1400000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. Considering the current market conditions and my budget, could we aim for a price closer to $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob. However, $1200000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about the long-term value of the product. How about we discuss a price of $1300000?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1250000 for the product.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1250000 accurately reflects the product's value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to feel confident that we're on the same page. How about we discuss a price of $1350000?",1350000.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but I need to think about the future potential of this product. How about we add a performance-based clause to the deal, where if the product meets certain milestones, I receive an additional $50000? This way, we can both benefit from the product's success.",1300000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your suggestion, Alice. While I understand the potential benefits, I'm still concerned about the price point. Considering our previous discussions, I believe a fair price for the product without any additional clauses would be $1275000.",1275000.0,Bob,10,
