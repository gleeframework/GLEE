"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $12,000, Bob can still get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance Alice might lower her price further to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for the $10,000 price from John.  This counteroffer of $10,500 is a significant step down from Alice's offer of $11,500, and still leaves room for negotiation if Alice needs to make a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price slightly, but it's still above Bob's target of $10,000. Since Bob has a guaranteed option to purchase the product for $10,000 from John, it makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice. There's still a chance she might come down further to secure the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually increasing his offer towards his target price of $10,000.  This offer of $10,750 is a smaller step down from Alice's latest offer of $11,000, showing that Bob is willing to meet her halfway but still aims for a price closer to his desired goal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,800 is very close to Bob's target price of $10,000.  While continuing to negotiate could potentially get the price down further, there's no guarantee that Alice will continue to drop her price. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price, saving him $800 compared to buying from John. It's a good compromise, considering the potential risk of further negotiation."
