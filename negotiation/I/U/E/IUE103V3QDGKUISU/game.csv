,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal. Let's close this deal!",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12500. Can you consider this offer?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12500 is still a bit too low.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $13250? This is a fair compromise, and it would be a great deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this!",13250.0,Alice,5,
