"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm happy to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. Let's try to meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll still get a good value.  What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with your offer.  While $13,000 is closer, it's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one final concession and come down to $13,250.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. If this offer isn't acceptable, I'll have to move on to other opportunities.  Please let me know your decision.",13250.0,Alice,5,
