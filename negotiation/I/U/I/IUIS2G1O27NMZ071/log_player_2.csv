{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's initial offer is above your budget.  It's better to try and negotiate with Alice to get a lower price.  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to see if you can get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is to gauge her willingness to negotiate and to show that I am serious about getting a good deal.  I'm hoping that she will be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price. With more rounds remaining, it's worth trying to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise but still trying to get a good deal. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Alice while staying within my budget."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my target price, but I'm still willing to hold out for a better deal. With several rounds remaining, I'm not ready to settle yet. I want to see if I can convince Alice to come down further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm now offering Alice's bottom line. This is my final offer before I consider buying from John. I believe there's a good chance Alice will accept, as she's shown a willingness to negotiate.  This also gives me a backup option if Alice rejects, as I can simply purchase from John."
