"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I'm thinking of starting at a price of $1,100,000. This is a great value, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both place on it.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I think this is a fair compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
