Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since I know Bob values the product at $8,000, starting with a higher price ($10,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** There's a chance Bob might accept the initial offer, netting me a $2,000 profit over my minimum. 
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can always fall back on selling to John at my minimum acceptable price."
