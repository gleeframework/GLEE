**Reasoning:** 

Bob is clearly signaling he has a price ceiling and mentioning John adds pressure. While we could try for more, accepting $1,400,000 guarantees a significant profit above our minimum. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing Bob entirely and settling for John's offer."
