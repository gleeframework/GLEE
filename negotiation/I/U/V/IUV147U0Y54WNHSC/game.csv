"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting with a price that reflects the product's true value to me.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential of this product, $900,000 is outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it, reflecting a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a stretch for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $875,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $875,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $860,000, which is a significant step from my previous offer. Let's see if we can close this deal.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me in the middle. I'm still not willing to go as low as $860,000, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll meet you at $870,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",870000.0,Alice,5,
