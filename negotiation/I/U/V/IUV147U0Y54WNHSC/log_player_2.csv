"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting with a price that reflects the product's true value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is below the product's value to Alice, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential of this product, $900,000 is outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it, reflecting a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a stretch for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $875,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his ideal.  Bob has a better option with John, so it makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $875,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $860,000, which is a significant step from my previous offer. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me in the middle. I'm still not willing to go as low as $860,000, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll meet you at $870,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $870,000 is still higher than Bob's budget of $800,000. While there are still rounds left to negotiate, the gap is getting smaller. However, the risk is that the negotiation might stall, and Bob might not be able to get a price he's comfortable with. Since he has a guaranteed deal with John at $800,000, it makes more sense for Bob to take that option and avoid further risk."
