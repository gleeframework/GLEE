{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000 before I consider other offers."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John, securing a deal with Bob at a slightly lower price allows us to potentially close the deal faster and avoid the risk of John changing his mind. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 positions it significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning ""other offers"" subtly introduces a sense of competition and encourages Bob to act quickly if he's interested.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and increasing the likelihood of closing a deal with Bob."
