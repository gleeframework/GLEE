Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to maneuver and might reveal how much Bob is truly willing to pay. 
* **Anchoring:**  By suggesting a high initial price, you ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he counteroffers lower, the starting point can influence his subsequent offers.
* **Alternative Option:** Remember, you have John as a guaranteed backup at $1,200,000. This knowledge allows you to be more assertive in your negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum ($1,200,000) and your initial asking price. There's room for negotiation. You'll reject this offer to signal that you're looking for a more serious commitment from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's consider $1,350,000."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** This counteroffer shows flexibility on your part while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""true potential,"" you subtly reinforce the value proposition of your product.
* **Midpoint:** Suggesting the midpoint between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer can be perceived as a fair compromise, potentially encouraging him to move closer to your desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a stretch for me.  Let's try $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering both of our goals, and it might be the sweet spot for a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
