"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's consider $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a stretch for me.  Let's try $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering both of our goals, and it might be the sweet spot for a deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
