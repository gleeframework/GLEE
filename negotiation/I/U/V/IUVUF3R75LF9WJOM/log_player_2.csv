"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $120 is still too high for him, and he wants to see if he can get a lower price.  He's willing to negotiate with Alice for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to consider $100? "", ""product_price"": 100} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to his ideal range. This is a good starting point for negotiations and might encourage Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  While $110 is still above his ideal price, it's within his budget and a good compromise.  He's likely to accept the offer to avoid further negotiation and secure the product."
