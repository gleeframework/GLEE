Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a valuable piece, and I think it's worth the price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that you are confident in the product's worth.  I'm choosing to leave room for negotiation because:

* **Potential for higher profit:**  There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more, especially if he sees the product as particularly valuable.
* **Avoid immediate rejection:** Starting too high might make Bob immediately reject the offer. 
* **Maintain control:** By leaving room for negotiation, I maintain control of the process and can adjust my offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000.  Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Maintain my minimum value:**  I'm not willing to sell below my minimum threshold.
* **Explore a potential higher offer:** I can make a counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to come up in price.
* **Utilize John as leverage:** Knowing John is willing to pay $10,000 gives me a stronger position in the negotiation.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to achieve a better outcome while still having the option to sell to John if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, I need to be closer to $10,000 to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This takes into account the value you've expressed for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer splits the difference between my minimum and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **High enough:** The price is still above my minimum acceptable value, but also leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Reasoning:** I've provided reasoning for my counteroffer, emphasizing the value of the product. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while maintaining a good position for a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000.  While I could continue negotiating,  I'm comfortable selling to John for $10,000.  This ensures I meet my minimum profit goal without risking further negotiation with Bob that might lead to an even lower offer. 

By choosing to sell to John, I'm taking the safe and certain option, securing a guaranteed profit."
