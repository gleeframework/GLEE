,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay around $10,000.  Would that work for you?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer, but $13,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  How about $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $11,000 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $12,500.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. If we don't agree on this price, I might have to reconsider selling to you.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I understand this is your bottom line, but I can't quite reach $12,500.  My absolute maximum is $11,500. If you can do that, we have a deal.  If not, I appreciate your time, and I'll need to consider my other options.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $11,500 simply isn't enough for me. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer willing to pay $12,000, so I'm only a small amount away from walking away.  To make this happen, I'm willing to accept $12,000 as a final offer. If you're willing to go that high, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll need to move on.",12000.0,Alice,7,
