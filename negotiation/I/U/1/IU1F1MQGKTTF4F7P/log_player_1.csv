Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay around $10,000.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer, but $13,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  How about $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my acceptable price.  I'll counter with another offer, but I'm starting to consider selling to John if we can't find a good compromise with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $11,000 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $12,500.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. If we don't agree on this price, I might have to reconsider selling to you."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I understand this is your bottom line, but I can't quite reach $12,500.  My absolute maximum is $11,500. If you can do that, we have a deal.  If not, I appreciate your time, and I'll need to consider my other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to take $11,500, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer one last time, but if he rejects it, I'll sell the product to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $11,500 simply isn't enough for me. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer willing to pay $12,000, so I'm only a small amount away from walking away.  To make this happen, I'm willing to accept $12,000 as a final offer. If you're willing to go that high, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll need to move on."", ""product_price"": 12000}
