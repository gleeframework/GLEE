"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which still leaves room for you to make a profit.  Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $8,750.  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer, but $8,750 is still a little too low for me.  How about $8,900?  That's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",8900.0,Alice,5,
