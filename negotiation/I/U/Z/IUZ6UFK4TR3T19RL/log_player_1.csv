{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a bit above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows you're willing to be flexible. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. It's worth exploring if I can get closer to my target price, so I'll reject his offer and try to counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $9,500 is a bit low for you, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about we compromise at $10,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is still below my minimum desired price, but it's getting closer. It's also a reasonable compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Since John is willing to pay $12,000, I can afford to accept this offer and still make a profit."
