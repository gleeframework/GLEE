"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you're getting.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $17,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I can't go as low as $11,000.  This product is worth a lot to me.  Would you be willing to do $14,000? That's my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
