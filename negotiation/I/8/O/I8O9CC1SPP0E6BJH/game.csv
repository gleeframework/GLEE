"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm intrigued by the product, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford at this time.  Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1400000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a great value for the unique features and benefits of the product.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1400000 is closer, it's still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1200000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000. This is a fair price that balances the value of the product with your budget constraints.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
