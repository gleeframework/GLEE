{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it could be a great asset to your business.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum.  This allows room for negotiation and potentially a win-win scenario.  I'll be ready to adjust my offer based on Bob's response, but I'll keep the $1,000,000 offer from John in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $900,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not at a point where I'm comfortable selling. I believe I can push for a higher price, and I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the negotiation. It's possible that Bob might be willing to go higher, and I'm prepared to counter his offer to see where we can land. However, I will keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if things don't work out with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit higher than your proposal. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, I must stick to my budgetary constraints. I would like to propose an updated counteroffer of $860,000. I hope this renewed proposal can facilitate our discussion towards reaching a satisfactory agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough decision, but at this point, Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.  While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial goal of $1,000,000, the potential of losing the deal to John makes it wiser to accept this offer. It's a good deal considering my initial goal, and I can still walk away with a substantial profit."
