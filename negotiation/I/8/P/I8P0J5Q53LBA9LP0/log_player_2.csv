"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer. $6,000 is a great price, but Bob has a budget of $12,000, and there's no reason to rush into a deal. By rejecting, Bob can gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially secure an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. He starts with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This aggressive counteroffer is designed to test Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially get her to budge on her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $5,500 is a good price, Bob is still aiming to save even more. He knows he has room to negotiate further, and rejecting the offer allows him to potentially secure a price closer to his initial counteroffer of $4,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his counteroffer, showing Alice that he is serious about buying the product but still trying to get a good price. He's splitting the difference between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and $5,200 is a good deal for Bob. While he could try to negotiate further, he risks losing the deal altogether.  The price is within his budget and offers substantial savings compared to John's offer. It's time to secure the purchase."
