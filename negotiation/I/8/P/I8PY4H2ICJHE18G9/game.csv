"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd be willing to pay $105 for it.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $110? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to pay $105, but I think that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle at $107.50?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  However, $107.50 is just too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $112.50? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $112.50 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $112.50, which would be $108.75. Can you consider that?",108.75,Bob,6,
