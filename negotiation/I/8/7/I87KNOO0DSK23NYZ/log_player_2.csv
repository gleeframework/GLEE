Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What are your thoughts?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're willing to make a serious offer. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1,100,000 is a bit short of that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,150,000, so I'll offer you $1,125,000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to work with me. While $1,125,000 is closer, I'm still a bit stretched.  I'm confident we can strike a deal at $1,100,000. This would give you a reasonable profit and ensure I'm able to make the purchase.  Let's see if we can finalize it here."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're close to your limit, but I'm still not at my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll offer you $1,120,000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has made concessions, her offer of $1,120,000 is still above your maximum budget. With only a few rounds remaining, it's unlikely you'll be able to get her down to your desired price. Buying from John at $1,000,000 guarantees you get the product at a price you're comfortable with and saves you valuable negotiation time."
