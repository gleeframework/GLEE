"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000.  This is a significant discount from its true value to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business.  Please consider this offer carefully, as I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $800,000 if you decline. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
