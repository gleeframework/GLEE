Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired selling price. This gives you room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:** By starting at $150, we can gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. His response will give us valuable information for our next move. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $100 provides a safety net. We won't feel pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $120 is closer to our minimum acceptable price, we still have room to negotiate. We'll aim to meet in the middle with our counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $135?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting $135, we're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  We're still aiming for a price significantly above our minimum of $100, reflecting the product's value.
* **Pressure:**  This counter-offer puts a little pressure on Bob, as it's closer to his initial offer than ours. It encourages him to move closer to our desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to counter with an offer of $125 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has incrementally increased his offer and is now at $125. While we could potentially push for a slightly higher price, accepting this offer makes sense for a few reasons:

* **Profitable:**  $125 is a solid profit margin above our minimum of $100. 
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time and effort. Accepting now secures the sale and avoids potentially protracted back-and-forth. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's no guarantee that Bob will go higher, and we risk him walking away. Accepting the $125 minimizes this risk."
