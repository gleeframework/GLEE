"I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $130 is closer, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to go down to $140.  What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $125 is still a little too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'll go down to $135.  How does that sound to you?",135.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
