"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,200,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable,  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $725,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I can go down to $850,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This is my final offer.",850000.0,Alice,5,
