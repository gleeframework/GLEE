"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,200,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $725,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I can go down to $850,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Alice is unwilling to go below $850,000, and it's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap. It's in your best interest to buy from John for $800,000 and avoid potentially overpaying."
