Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, giving Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I profit above my minimum.  I'll see how he reacts and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While $130 is better than selling to John, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price slightly to $145. This shows flexibility to Bob and might encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $135 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum price and a reasonable profit. Accepting his offer makes the most sense at this point."
