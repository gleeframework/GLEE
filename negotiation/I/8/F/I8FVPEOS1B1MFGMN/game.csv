"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a truly unique item. I'm thinking of a price of $1500000 for it. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"I'm very interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something we can work with?",900000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $900000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $1200000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate the discount, Alice, but $1200000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1050000. Is that something we can work with?",1050000.0,Bob,4,,

"I see you're willing to compromise, Bob. I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1200000 to $1050000, so I'll counter with $1150000. This is my best offer, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me in the middle",1150000.0,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but $1150000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1075000. Is that something we can work with?",1075000.0,Bob,6,,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1150000 to $1075000, so I'll counter with $1112500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,7,,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1125000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1087500. However, I'm getting close to my maximum budget, so I'd appreciate it if we could meet at or below that price.",1087500.0,Bob,8,,
