"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay up to $1,200,000. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but I still think $1,200,000 is a fair price given my budget constraints. Can we not come to an agreement closer to my maximum? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly anchoring on $1,200,000, but we know the product is worth significantly more to him. It's still early in the negotiation, and accepting now would leave a lot of money on the table. We need to incentivize him to move away from his anchor."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be sure this deal makes sense for me as well. Let's try a different approach.  Would you consider $1,230,000 and we close the deal today?"",
""product_price"": 1230000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting the Anchor:** By dropping the price to $1,230,000, we're making a smaller concession than before, signaling that we're getting closer to our bottom line. This can encourage Bob to move away from his firm $1,200,000 stance.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Introducing a ""close the deal today"" element adds a bit of pressure and can make Bob more amenable to compromise.  He risks us walking away if he remains inflexible. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** While this offer is closer to Bob's, it still leaves us some wiggle room to potentially go down a little further if needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the flexibility, Alice. Considering my budget, $1,220,000 seems like a reasonable compromise. Let's aim for this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting close, but we can likely squeeze a bit more. Bob moving from $1,200,000 to $1,220,000 shows he's willing to negotiate. Rejecting now keeps the pressure on and allows us to push for a slightly higher price in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer. Let's wrap this up â€“ $1,225,000, and we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 1225000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This offer meets Bob halfway between his last offer ($1,220,000) and our previous counteroffer ($1,230,000). It shows a willingness to compromise but also sets a firm limit.
* **Finality:** The language ""wrap this up"" and ""we have a deal"" emphasizes that this is our final offer. This can encourage Bob to accept rather than risk the deal falling through.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're now past the halfway point in the negotiation.  Making it clear that we're close to a deal can add a subtle time pressure for Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go up to $1,220,000. This feels like a fair price considering our previous discussions. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to accept.  Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  We've negotiated Bob up to $1,220,000 from his initial $1,200,000.  Trying to squeeze out another few thousand dollars risks him walking away entirely.
* **Time Remaining:**  We only have two rounds left. If we reject and continue to haggle, we risk running out of time and ending up with John's lower offer. 
* **Solid Profit:**  $1,220,000 is a strong profit margin.  While we could potentially get more, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price at this point."
