"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I understand it's a lot of money, but this product is worth significantly more. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a deal you won't want to miss.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
