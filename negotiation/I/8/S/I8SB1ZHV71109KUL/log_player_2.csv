Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer. Would you consider $1,025,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm eager to make this work.  How about we settle at $1,000,000 even?  That's a strong offer reflecting the true value of this product.

Alice has come down to her product's true value. There's no guarantee she'll go any lower, and continuing the negotiation risks letting this deal slip away.  Accepting now ensures you get the product at a good price."
