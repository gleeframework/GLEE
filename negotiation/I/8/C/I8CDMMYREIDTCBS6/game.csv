"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider letting it go for $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit.  $15,000 is still too high for my budget.  Could we agree on $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $13,000 is still a stretch for me. I could meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you consider $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,6,
