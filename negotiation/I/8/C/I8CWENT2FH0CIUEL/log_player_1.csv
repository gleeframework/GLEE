Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This is a fair starting point considering the product is worth $8,000 to both of us. It leaves room for negotiation but also ensures I don't immediately undervalue my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to get the best price possible, I'm willing to negotiate. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}

I'm countering with $8,500. This is still a fair price, considering the value of the product, and it shows that I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below what I'm willing to settle for. I'll counteroffer once more to see if we can come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200}
```

I'm offering $8,200. This is a slight reduction from my previous offer, but it still ensures I don't go below my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  It's not worth risking further rounds of negotiation that might not lead to a better deal. I'll sell the product to John for $8,000 to ensure a secure and profitable outcome."
