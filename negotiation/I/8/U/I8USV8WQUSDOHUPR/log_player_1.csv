Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I aim for a price that's significantly higher than my minimum ($12,000) but still appealing to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $14,000 is a strong starting point, there might be room for Bob to negotiate slightly upwards, further increasing my profit.
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:**  Offering it too close to his maximum value ($15,000) might scare him off. Leaving some ""consumer surplus"" makes him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Secure the Sale:**  Bob is the more profitable buyer. This offer attempts to secure the deal with him before resorting to selling to John."
