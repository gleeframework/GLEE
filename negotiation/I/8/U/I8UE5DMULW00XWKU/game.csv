"Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,250,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I agree it's a great product, $1,250,000 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  That's my best offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
