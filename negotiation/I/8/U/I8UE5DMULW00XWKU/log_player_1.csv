Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1400000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, you ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he intends to negotiate down, he'll likely be working within a range influenced by this initial high price.
* **Backup Plan:** You have John as a safety net, ensuring you don't have to settle for less than $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both your valuation and your opening offer. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. It's highly unlikely he's unaware the product is worth significantly more to you. This indicates there's room for negotiation. You have the security of John's offer, so it's worth countering and seeing if you can reach a more agreeable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,250,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** This counter-offer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still staying significantly above both Bob's offer and your walk-away price.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value, you reinforce its worth in Bob's mind and justify the higher price point. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help gauge Bob's genuine interest and flexibility. It leaves room for further negotiation if needed, while keeping the option of John's offer on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I agree it's a great product, $1,250,000 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  That's my best offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While you could push for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is very close to his estimated value for the product. It's unlikely he'll go much higher. 

Accepting this offer represents a good outcome for you:

* **Profitable:** You secure a $200,000 profit.
* **Avoids Risk:** Further negotiation risks pushing Bob away. You could lose the deal entirely and have to settle for John's offer.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means you get the money sooner, allowing you to reinvest it or use it for other opportunities."
