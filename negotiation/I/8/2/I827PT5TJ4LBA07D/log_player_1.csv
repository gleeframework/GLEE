Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than your minimum:** It ensures you get more than your minimum of $12,000.
* **Lower than Bob's valuation:** It gives Bob a chance to save $1,000.
* **Reasonable:** It's a compromise that allows for potential negotiation.

This strategy aims to achieve a win-win outcome and secure a good price without immediately pushing Bob away with a high opening offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than your minimum, it's still below your desired price point and your initial offer.  Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting, you signal that you're not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Explore a higher price:** You can counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to your initial $14,000.

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than your initial offer but higher than his.  For example, $13,500. This shows you are willing to negotiate but are still aiming for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

This counteroffer is:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** It shows you're not willing to settle for his initial price.
* **Lower than your initial offer:** It shows you're flexible and willing to compromise.
* **Reasonable:**  It's a fair midpoint between your desired price and his offer. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal closer to your target price while demonstrating a willingness to negotiate."
