"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $14,000 is better than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13500.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $15,000 and is closer to Bob's desired price point.  While further negotiation might be possible, accepting the offer saves Bob time and ensures he gets the product without risking a breakdown in negotiations."
