It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Good Price:**  $955,000 is a solid price, well below your $1,200,000 maximum and a significant savings compared to John's offer.
* **Time:**  You've gone back and forth several rounds, and Alice is clearly willing to negotiate.  While you might squeeze out a few thousand more, there's a risk Alice will become less flexible.

It's a good deal - take it!"
