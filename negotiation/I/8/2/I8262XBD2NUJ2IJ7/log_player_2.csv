Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still quite a ways off from where I see this deal happening.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.  If you're able to come up to $1,400,000, the product is yours.  Otherwise, I need to consider my other option. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Alice is playing hardball and her latest offer is still significantly higher than John's price. It's unlikely she'll come down to a price that beats John's offer within a reasonable timeframe.
