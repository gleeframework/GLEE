You have three options:

It's not worth it to buy from Alice at $16,500. You can get the same product from John for $15,000, so it makes more sense to counteroffer Alice and try to get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering Alice $14,000 for the product. This is a good starting point for negotiation, as it's lower than John's price but still gives Alice a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than John's price. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, it's better to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
