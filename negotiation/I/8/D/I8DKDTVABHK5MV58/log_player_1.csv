Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to the maximum I think Bob might be willing to pay, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This price allows for Bob to make a counteroffer without me feeling like I've given up too much. 
* **Staying Above My Minimum:**  $11,500 is still significantly above my minimum price of $10,000, ensuring I make a profit. 
* **The Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value for Bob. It also leaves the door open for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I can still potentially do better.
* **Negotiation:** I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The risk of rejecting Bob's offer is that he might walk away. However, the potential reward of getting a higher price is worth that risk.
* **John's Offer:**  Even if negotiations with Bob fail, I have John as a backup buyer at my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a little low for me.  Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would still give you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still securing a good price.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to justify the price.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price to appeal to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Final Offer:** This is likely to be my final offer. If Bob rejects, I'll accept John's offer and move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $10,750 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Potential Loss:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a good chance he'll walk away. I'm not sure if I can get a higher price in further negotiations.
* **John's Offer:**  Even though Bob's offer is a bit lower than my ideal, it's still significantly better than John's offer of $10,000. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer minimizes the risk of losing the deal entirely and guarantees a profit."
