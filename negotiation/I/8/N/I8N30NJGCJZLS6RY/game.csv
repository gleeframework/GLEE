"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, how about $110? It's still a great price for a product worth $120, and it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $107.50? That's the best I can do.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - $109.  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go above $108. I've already stretched my budget, and I'm not comfortable paying more than that. Can you meet me at $108?",108.0,Bob,6,
