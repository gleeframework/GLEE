"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a fair price. I'm confident this will be mutually beneficial. Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay $1,750,000. I'm thinking of making a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price considering the unique value of this product. Let's meet in the middle and find a deal that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This price reflects the product's unique value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",1450000.0,Bob,6,
