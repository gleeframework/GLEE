"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a fair price. I'm confident this will be mutually beneficial. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but below my minimum ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially get a good deal.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win, highlighting the opportunity and emphasizing fairness. This might encourage Bob to consider the offer more seriously. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm not starting with my absolute maximum, allowing for potential counteroffers and a chance to find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay $1,750,000. I'm thinking of making a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** While I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer, there's still room for negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground.
* **Potential for better deal:**  Selling to John is a guaranteed $1,500,000, but I believe I can potentially get a higher price from Bob by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price considering the unique value of this product. Let's meet in the middle and find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm coming down from my initial offer but still staying above my minimum price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique value to encourage him to reconsider.
* **Mutual benefit:** I'm emphasizing a desire to find a solution that works for both of us. This could help build rapport and keep the negotiation positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it's still below it.  
* **Potential for better deal:** I'm still confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob.  The fact that he's willing to keep negotiating suggests he might be willing to go a bit higher.
* **Risk vs. reward:** Selling to John is a guaranteed $1,500,000, but I'm willing to take the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob, hoping to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This price reflects the product's unique value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant compromise:** I'm only coming down $50,000 from my minimum, showing I'm serious but not desperate.
* **Highlighting my compromise:** I'm emphasizing that this is a significant concession to make the offer seem more appealing to Bob.
* **Mutual benefit focus:** I'm still framing it as a win-win situation to encourage Bob to close the deal.

I'm hoping this small but strategic counteroffer will push Bob closer to my desired price.  I'm also taking into consideration the risk of selling to John at $1,500,000, but I believe that by continuing to negotiate, I can potentially secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not enough:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it's still below it.  
* **Time is running out:** We are in round 6, meaning only 4 rounds left.  
* **Minimizing risk:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is only $50,000 less than Bob's current offer. Given the limited time, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob outweighs the potential gain.  

It's a tough decision, but I'm choosing to minimize risk and secure the guaranteed deal with John."
