"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Can you meet me in the middle?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this deal. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make up for the difference. How about we meet at $16000? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14500, which is closer to the original offer you made, but still a bit lower than the middle ground we were discussing. Can you consider this price?",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $15500? I think it's a fair price that balances out the value of the product for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $15500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $15250. Can you consider this price?",15250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the wire, Bob. I'm not sure if I want to go any lower than $15500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to try to get this deal done. How about we meet at $15750? I think it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's a compromise that works for both of us.",15750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice, but $15750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $15000, which is the lowest I'm comfortable with. Can you consider this price?",15000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated that we're not meeting in the middle, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to try to get this deal done. Since you're willing to pay $15000, I'm willing to meet you at that price. I think it's a fair price, and I'm willing to call it a day. How about we say $15000?",15000.0,Alice,9,
