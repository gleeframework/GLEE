Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to let it go for $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value to Bob, potentially making him more amenable to a higher price. 

**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net, there's always a chance Bob could accept a lower offer. You'll need to decide how much risk you're willing to take for potentially higher profit."
